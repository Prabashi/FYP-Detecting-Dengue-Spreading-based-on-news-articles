b'DMT to launch E-motoring system from July',"b'Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:25:30 +0000'","b""2019-01-10 18:25:30\n\nThe e-motoring system for the registration of vehicles through an online system would be implemented by the end of July, the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) said.\n\nDMT Commissioner-General A.H.K. Jagath Chandrasiri said the e-motoring system would connect all stakeholders in the field including importers, sales centres and insurances around the country.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe new system will ease consumers to record all details in an electronic system relating to vehicles such as import details, registrations, transfers, licence renewals and all other important details,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe Department had spoken about the e-motoring system since 2008, he said, but by implementing this system, the DMT hopes to do vehicle registrations within a short period of time.\n\nSo, the vehicle owners can come to the Department on their own and will able to do their vehicle registrations,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Information and Communication Technology Commissioner of DMT Susantha F. Suraweera said while implementing the e-motoring system, the DMT hopes to connect vehicle import institutes, leasing facility provider institutes and other state institutions relating to the vehicle registrations.\n\nSri Lanka Customs Department and Department of Import & Export Control would be connected through an electronic system via the internet.

b'A Trypanosoma species detected in a dog; a first in SL',"b'Thu, 10 Jan 2019 15:43:10 +0000'","b'2019-01-10 15:43:10\n\nA dog in Balangoda was found to have been infected by a parasitic disease known as Trypanosoma. It was the first time that such a disease was detected in Sri Lanka, Senior Lecturer in Veterinary Clinical Studies, Professor Ashoka Dangolla said.\n\nSome of the symptoms of this disease are fever, severe headaches, irritability, extreme fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, aching muscles and joints and feeling sleepy and lethargic.\n\nThe dog was found to be suffering from this disease last month with infected eyes. The Balangoda Veterinary Department had referred the dog to the Peradeniya Veterinary Department, which was also unsuccessful in treating it. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Professor Dangolla said that subsequently they had received a report of a similar infection from Mullaitivu.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn cases of eye infections, it is normal to run a test to eliminate Trypanosoma. But this species of Trypanosoma has never been detected in Sri Lanka,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nProf. Dangolla said he hoped that our veterinary doctors consider this detection of the Trypanosoma virus as something serious. \xe2\x80\x9cVeterinary doctors mainly deal in livestock such as cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and household pets like dogs, cats.\n\nBut parasites are known to survive in animals whether household pets or farming animals. According to reports from foreign countries, the Trypanosoma species is transmitted by the tsetse fly.\n\nThe Tsetse flies are normally found in sub-Saharan Africa but also known to have been found in several other regions as well. Up to now there\xe2\x80\x99s been no record of such flies being found in Sri Lanka. The doctors are checking on how this Trypanosoma species has been transmitted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nProf. Dangolla said the most dangerous thing in the current Trypanosoma situation was that it could be transmitted to humans and added that there were several species of Trypanosoma in the world but it was essential to pinpoint the species detected in our country.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrypanosoma can manifest itself as a skin disease. We are collecting mosquito larve, flies, mosquitoes and blood samples of animals in Ratnapura, Balangoda and Embilipitiya for laboratory tests.\n\nSome of the research is being carried out with the participation of officials of the Peradeniya University Veterinary Faculty, Allied Health Services and the University Health Services,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

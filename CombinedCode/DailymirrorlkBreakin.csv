"International Infection Prevention Week Prevention better than cure","2018-10-19 11:26:26							0						 				2785"," International Infection Prevention Week (IIPV) falls onto the 3rd week of October annually. According to the World Health Organization, infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in developing countries and the second major cause of death worldwide, after cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, infections have the ability to cause major damage to an individual as well as the society as a whole. That is why we decided to consult Dr. Kushlani Jayatilleke, Consultant Microbiologist, Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital and President of the Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists, in this week’s Health Capsule to enlighten readers about the exceedingly timely topic of infection prevention.InfectionsBefore talking about prevention of infections, it is important to identify what an infection is. An infection is a disease condition caused by a micro organism which is not visible to the naked eye. Our body contains more micro organisms than it contains human cells, most of which actually help us, so not all these micro organisms are harmful. Infections can be categorised in a number of ways. These infections can be classified as bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal. They can also be grouped according to the site of the infection; infections in the upper respiratory tract as upper respiratory infections, infections in the urinary tract as urinary infections etc. Infections on the superficial parts of the body are called superficial infections, while the infections in deep structures like bones and joints are called deep infections. Spread of infectionInfections have survived through the passage of time by spreading from one person to another. Contrary to what people believe in, the mode of the spreading of the disease differs according to the organism and the infection that it causes. Respiratory tract infections are commonly spread through air droplets that are released when the patient coughs or sneezes. Also, if the patient sneezes to the open hand, then shakes hands with another person without washing his hand the second person can get contaminated. Organisms causing infections in our digestive system commonly enter the body through food and water that are contaminated by infected faecal matter. In addition, flies too can spread infection in the digestive system through contaminating food. There are infections which are chiefly transmitted through sexual contact. Syphillis, gonrrhoea and HIV are examples.Some other infections are spread through blood given from outside, as in unsafe transfusions, (which are extremely rare in Sri Lanka due to safety precautions) and in reusing needles contaminated with blood from an infected patient, or in healthcare setting and contaminated needle prick injuries.There are some other infections where the pathogenic organism is transferred from one person’s body to another by a vector. Dengue, which is causing much devastation in our country, and Malaria are examples.  Prevention of infectionsAs the spread of the infections is individualised to the type of infection, it stands to reason that the methods of prevention of the spread of the organisms also differ according to the infection.In preventing the spread of respiratory infections and infections like chickenpox which are spread through droplets, it’s important to avoid crowds where you can infect the others with the disease. Usually the first symptoms to appear in these infections are fever and malaise, so seeking treatment early, getting diagnosed and staying at home in order to take plenty of bed rest are advisable. Since influenza in most cases resolves on its own, adequate fluid and bed rest bring the best cure. If you have a cough or are sneezing and have to be in the presence of others, the best option is to use a face mask.  Cough etiquetteIf you do not have a facemask and have to cough or sneeze in public, you have to follow what is called the ‘Cough etiquette’. If you can, cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue paper while coughing and sneezing, in order to prevent the droplets from escaping. If you do not have a tissue or a handkerchief, use the back of your arm and not the hands to cover your face, since you can easily contaminate the surfaces that you touch after coughing by accidentally touching them with your hand. Proper hygieneMany of the digestive tract infections can be prevented by using proper water sealed toilets, and by washing and drying hands well after using the washroom. Food hygiene is crucial in preventing digestive tract infections. Well cooked, home prepared meals are ideal. Even though salads are good for your health, you have to make sure to clean the raw vegetables thoroughly before preparing salads, especially during the rainy season where the vegetables can be easily contaminated by the flood of dirty water. Keeping the food covered at all times while preparing also will help prevent the contamination of food. Hands are a major tool that spread infection; therefore hand washing before preparation as well as consumption of meals is important. RefrigerationIf the food will not be consumed soon after preparation, it is advisable to store them in a refrigerator at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, since in warm countries like Sri Lanka, bacteria can multiply quickly and spoil food. Food can be reheated before they are consumed, but reheating more than once is not recommended. Alternatively, food can be refrigerated and stored in small containers as single helpings, so there is no need of reheating.Raw food and cooked food should not be shelved near one another because the raw food can contaminate the solid food. MosquitoesIn order to prevent vector borne infections like dengue, prevention of the spread of the vector is important. Checking for places where water gets collected in your surroundings and inside your house and destroying them will prevent the growth of mosquitoes through destroyal of their breeding places. While mosquito repellents might help in keeping the vector away, mosquito nets are of not much practical use especially when it comes to Dengue, since the mosquito carrying the dengue virus usually bites humans during day time.  In the hospitalHospitals are grounds which have a higher risk of giving you an infection, especially because hospitals contain many patients with a variety of infections. Therefore, don’t bring young children and immune-compromised people to hospitals unless absolutely necessary. Minimising the contact of the surfaces and objects in the hospital and washing hands soon after returning from the hospital is recommended. Blood borne infections spread through transfused blood is extremely rare now due to the vigorous screening process of donated blood before transfusing. If you have had an accidental injury from a used needle, or have had high risk sexual behaviours in the past, seeking medical advise immediately is recommended. VaccinationImmunization of children from a younger age has helped Sri Lanka prevent many vaccine preventable infections and position us among the developing countries with the best health indicators. Therefore, the timely vaccination of your child is highly recommended. In addition, there are some vaccines available in the private sector like the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine, especially for people who have low immune systems."

"Caring and snaring in the name of fostering","2018-10-02 10:21:12							0						 				7552","We should establish a proper screening system for foster parents	There’s a huge amount of emotional abuse experienced by these children which cannot even be defined	We don’t simply allow them to leave the orphanages because we know that they havereached an age where they are quite mischievous and stubborn	They are brought up from the day they reach these homes, but after they reach 18 years of age, they are expected to be independentIn most instances orphanages ask for money and dry rations. But that is not what the children want. They would want a toy or a favourite food. Hence an evil system has been created. - Professor Harendra De Silva	There are many different institutions including orphanages run by the private sector	In 2017 we handed over 279 children back to their guardians	Limitations in adapting the foster care systemEvery child born to this world has a mother and a father. But not every mother and father will be ready to accept their child. Hence, the possibilities are such that a child could be abandoned for the rest of its life, sometimes at a tender age. This is why stories featuring two to three- week-old infants abandoned by the roadside are occasionally reported. While every child needs parental care and affection; in certain instances parents are not ready to give the necessary care due to various reasons. Most children never get to see their parents while some others are taken away when they are in their teens. In Sri Lanka, care homes or orphanages are actual homes to many children who are abandoned or neglected by their parents. They are brought up from the day they reach these homes, but after they reach 18 years of age, they are expected to be independent. However, many among them aren’t ready to face the society yet and often become victims again. With no support, money and guidance they are often led on to the wrong paths. Who needs to be responsible for them after they leave the places which provide them with care? Whether they are safe and what they would do afterwards are few of the many questions that begs answers.In such a backdrop, the Daily mirror  spoke to a few care leavers who related their rather heartening stories and also spoke to experts to find out what is being done and what needs to be done for the betterment of these youth.Stranded in societyOnce a child reaches its adolescent years, he or she has to leave these orphanages as per the law of the country. But the Daily mirror learned that in most instances such children are asked to leave by the age of 16 if they fail their O/L examination. The plight of care leavers is such that they are being brought up from a young age within a care home and provided with all facilities. But once they are asked to leave, most of them are not ready to face society yet. They feel stranded and become victims again. Due to the stigma associated with them, they are often misled and are provoked to take wrong turns in life. Hence girls have a tendency to end-up at a spa or a massage parlour while boys are taken to do odd jobs such as carpentry or domestic work in houses. Care leavers don’t have a valid birth certificate nor an identity card. Their addresses are usually that of their orphanage and since they don’t have a permanent address on their ID they are deprived of their basic right to vote. Amidst such a backdrop there are a few who are striving to do well in life and are hoping for a brighter future. The Daily mirror  spoke to a few of them;The plight of Dinushka*Dinushka doesn’t have both her parents and was sent to Colombo after she sat for her Ordinary Level Exam (O/Ls) in 2009. Although she has been married for five years her journey so far has had more downs than ups. “I was enrolled for a training course and sent to Colombo. I did everything on my own. I wasn’t prepared to do a job and I was financially handicapped. So I had to do a job. I was reluctant to speak to strangers, but I gained confidence. There was nobody to advise us on what we should do after we leave our homes. I remember once when I was admitted to hospital to undergo surgery I had no one beside me. It was then that I realised why everybody needs a mother in life. My husband also doesn’t have anybody and he wasn’t allowed to come inside the hospital. There is only one name in my birth certificate and the same appears in my ID as well. I don’t have a right to vote since my ID has the address of the orphanage I stayed in,” she said.A call to empower care leavers*Natasha was left at the orphanage when she was just three weeks old. “I have two brothers and a sister who were also at the orphanage. At one point my mother took me home along with my siblings, but I went through a rather traumatising experience. She beat me up and home was like hell to me. My mother didn’t take care of me at all and I had to do everything by myself. After I finished my O/Ls she attempted to force me into a marriage for money, but I escaped. I wanted to return to the home, but the authorities there didn’t allow me in since I was already 16. Thereafter I got myself enrolled at an institute offering a one year dental surgery course. There were many children from other homes working with me and we were all sent to Colombo. But we didn’t know the whereabouts and with no money in hand we were stranded. We didn’t know which bus to take and therefore walked on the streets till midnight on several occasions. We were reluctant to speak to people because they were waiting to take advantage of us. I then stayed with a relation of mine and learned to commute within Colombo. I left my family four years ago and now live alone. I was told that my birth certificate was a fake, and since there are two dates on my birth certificate and ID I still don’t know my actual age or birthday. Therefore I cannot open a bank account nor vote. The homes aren’t interested in finding out what happens to us after we leave especially in the case of girls. People are of the view that we don’t need money since we are from orphanages. The stigma we face is such that my friends have sometimes thought of taking their own lives. When I used to work I often heard the phrase ‘mung anatha nivase ewung’ (they are from orphanages) and similar derogatory remarks. It would be better if the Government could implement a plan to empower care leavers as we see it as a basic right which has been taken away from us,” she said.The term ‘anatha madama’ isn’t accurate*Ramya was left at an orphanage when she was eight-months-old. Her story is an example of how care leavers are stigmatised in society. “After I completed my Advanced Level Exam (A/Ls) I started working at a communication centre. After sometime the owner sold it to another person and he took advantage of me. He promised to send me reloads and give money for food and transport. But after a while he demanded a huge amount of money from me. So I had to spend all my savings to cover up the debt. Likewise I have faced many challenges in life. The term ‘anatha madama’ is not accurate; it is actually our home. When people realise that we don’t have parents they treat us like animals. We are labelled in society and it puts us under huge stress. We don’t have money in our bank accounts and because we are being treated in this way, we too look at society with anger. Therefore I make a humble request to everybody to accept us for who we are and allow us to lead a normal life like everybody else,” she said.Seeing opportunities through mediaI knew how people looked at us. I went to four schools and viewed society with much hatred*Nimmi was sent to an orphanage when she was 10-years-old. “We had to wear uniform. From those days I knew how people looked at us. I went to four schools and viewed society with much hatred. I used to wonder why all this happened to me and those around me. I then had to appear in courts and even the day before my O/Ls I had a hearing. I failed my O/Ls in the first attempt and I thought I should pass. I stayed at the home for an additional year and passed the exam. Although I did A/Ls I couldn’t do the subject of my choice. I wanted to study music, but I didn’t get a popular school. I then wanted to study law, but then again I thought it wouldn’t be the best bet for me. Thereafter I got in to writing and eventually was interested in media. I was lucky enough to do a course in journalism in India. I write a lot during my free time and I thought the media is the best way to stand up for our own rights and spread awareness about it. I stay at the Sarvodaya hostel. I can’t stay at a rented place because I have no money. I like to study further, but I don’t have the support nor money. When we leave the homes we don’t have a right to choose the job we like. We are just put into anything that is available, so we have to continue whether we like it or not,” she said.Facing pregnancy aloneSumudu was left at an orphanage when she was two-months-old. “After I did my A/Ls I was handed over to my mother, but I didn’t want to go. I then did a course in nursing and it was quite challenging with night shifts etc. I later came to Colombo, but didn’t have lodging. I didn’t have cash to pay the boarding fees. In the meantime I contracted dengue and I didn’t have anybody to look after me. Without parents we don’t know how to proceed in life in certain instances. For example if a girl becomes pregnant she would need her mother by her side, but in our case we have nobody. The Government needs to have a plan for those who leave orphanages; at least a plan to reconnect them with their biological parents. To date I haven’t shown my birth certificate to anyone. The ID too doesn’t have a permanent address and it’s a challenge to live with fake documents. Therefore we urge the authorities to come up with a plan for the betterment of care leavers,” she said.They are now employed at a church and are advocating for change through the Voice for Voiceless Foundation.*The true names of the interviewees have been withheld under strict condition of anonymityMapping out their futureIn her comments, Western Province Commissioner for Probation and Childcare Chandima Dissanayake said that once the children reach the age of 16 they are returned to their biological parents. “But there are instances when we cannot send them back to their homes because there have been instances when they have been raped by family members. During such instances we send them for a training course or a job and also provide accommodation. If they like to marry we allow them to proceed with their consent. In 2017 we handed over 279 children back to their guardians and these included children under 18 as well. We have also sent 15 of them for vocational training and 38 were permanently employed. If the youth are sitting for their A/Ls after they reach 18 years, they are allowed to stay at their homes and complete the exam. We don’t simply allow them to leave the orphanages because we know that they have reached an age where they are quite mischievous and stubborn,” said Dissanayake.When asked about the issue of permanent residence on IDs, she said that it depended on the way in which the form was filled. “If they just include the number and the address of the place without mentioning the name of the children’s home it will not be an issue. But in the case of a child from a certified school, if he or she doesn’t have parents then we have to include that the child is from a certified school. We also send the youth to do jobs depending on the court order. We also support unmarried girls and boys and give them food and accommodation and allow them to take up whatever job they like. When I took office there was no plan for care leavers in the Western Province, but I’m happy to say that we have already implemented an effective plan afterwards,” added Dissanayake.Foster care system the way forwardSpeaking to the Daily mirror , founder Chairman of National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), activist and legislator in child protection Professor Harendra De Silva said that institutional care isn’t the best for a child. “There are many different institutions including orphanages run by the private sector which are usually funded by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In addition to that there are state-run orphanages and institutions such as certified, demand and detention homes. Children in detention homes are above five years of age whose actions have been in conflict with the law. They may be found guilty of stealing two coconuts or for jumping over a fence to a neighbouring land etc., and therefore will have to face a jail term. Some of these children have been abandoned while the others are street children. While within these institutions they have a greater tendency to experience sexual and other forms of abuse. There have been so many such incidents in the past. There’s a huge amount of emotional abuse experienced by these children which cannot even be defined. When I was NCPA Chairman each child received Rs. 21 per day for food and other expenses and orphanages and care homes relied on alms givings and other donations in kind. However there is open mismanagement of funds and resources by the staff,” said Prof. De Silva.“In most instances orphanages ask for money and dry rations. But that is not what the children want. They would want a toy or a favourite food. Hence an evil system has been created. We aren’t trying to empower the children, but wish to enhance their self-respect. Western countries have adopted the foster care parent system which is a cheaper approach for the government as well. Here, each foster parent is given a certain amount of money to take care of the child. But the only issue here is that these foster parents should be screened because in certain instances these foster parents could be abusers or they may use children for domestic work. Hence we should establish a proper screening system for foster parents by seeking support from qualified psychologists and social workers. We are experts at showing off people who appear to be pseudo-experts and they flood the market. They appear with fake certificates and claim to be proper counsellors,” warned Prof. De Silva.Prof. De Silva further said that Sri Lanka also doesn’t have a proper monitoring system. “Once a child is in foster care there should be people who must monitor and evaluate the progress of the child. They should be able to go to school and monitor the performance, check for absenteeism and observe how the child is being treated at home. Foster parents may look at legal methods to adopt a child servant and such moves should be discouraged.During a screening the child’s health and nutritional status should also be monitored and evaluated. Another way of foster care is where the child lives with his or her biological parents, but another foster family could support them with money and resources. A few limitations of this process would be that it has to be handled by someone who knows the subject.The Government doesn’t have as many professionals from the perspective of administration.They work according to regulations and circulars and therefore things don’t happen as planned. We need good professionals who are committed to the subject and they should decide on the standards of procedures. We can seek support from Grama Niladhari and Samurdhi officers who could be trained to go from house to house to monitor the foster care process.There are probation officers in the country, but they have been appointed for political purposes.They would obey an order from the top, but will not work for the best interest of the children. In addition to that we could identify dysfunctional families and provide them with supplements. Hence there has to be a paradigm shift in the way of thinking. There’s politics everywhere, but somebody has to take a decision and this responsibility is vested upon the leadership,” he opined.Generation Never Give Up‘Generation Never Give Up’ is a platform that has been established to empower youth leaving residential care in order to create a generation that will never give up. Therefore it aims to create a safe and inclusive society, for youth leaving residential care before or after the age of 18 with the support of state and non-state stakeholders. Services provided under this platform include job opportunities and career guidance, scholarships for higher education, psychological counselling, legal support, peer support, an emergency hotline and an information database.For further details visit www.gnglk.org"

They may be found guilty of stealing two coconuts or for jumping over a fence to a neighbouring land etc., and therefore will have to face a jail term. Some of these children have been abandoned while the others are street children. While within these institutions they have a greater tendency to experience sexual and other forms of abuse. There have been so many such incidents in the past. There’s a huge amount of emotional abuse experienced by these children which cannot even be defined. When I was NCPA Chairman each child received Rs. 21 per day for food and other expenses and orphanages and care homes relied on alms givings and other donations in kind. However there is open mismanagement of funds and resources by the staff,” said Prof. De Silva. “In most instances orphanages ask for money and dry rations. But that is not what the children want. They would want a toy or a favourite food. Hence an evil system has been created. We aren’t trying to empower the children, but wish to enhance their self-respect. Western countries have adopted the foster care parent system which is a cheaper approach for the government as well. Here, each foster parent is given a certain amount of money to take care of the child. But the only issue here is that these foster parents should be screened because in certain instances these foster parents could be abusers or they may use children for domestic work. Hence we should establish a proper screening system for foster parents by seeking support from qualified psychologists and social workers. We are experts at showing off people who appear to be pseudo-experts and they flood the market. They appear with fake certificates and claim to be proper counsellors,” warned Prof. De Silva. Prof. De Silva further said that Sri Lanka also doesn’t have a proper monitoring system. “Once a child is in foster care there should be people who must monitor and evaluate the progress of the child. They should be able to go to school and monitor the performance, check for absenteeism and observe how the child is being treated at home. Foster parents may look at legal methods to adopt a child servant and such moves should be discouraged. During a screening the child’s health and nutritional status should also be monitored and evaluated. Another way of foster care is where the child lives with his or her biological parents, but another foster family could support them with money and resources. A few limitations of this process would be that it has to be handled by someone who knows the subject. The Government doesn’t have as many professionals from the perspective of administration. They work according to regulations and circulars and therefore things don’t happen as planned. We need good professionals who are committed to the subject and they should decide on the standards of procedures. We can seek support from Grama Niladhari and Samurdhi officers who could be trained to go from house to house to monitor the foster care process. There are probation officers in the country, but they have been appointed for political purposes. They would obey an order from the top, but will not work for the best interest of the children. In addition to that we could identify dysfunctional families and provide them with supplements. Hence there has to be a paradigm shift in the way of thinking. There’s politics everywhere, but somebody has to take a decision and this responsibility is vested upon the leadership,” he opined. Generation Never Give Up‘Generation Never Give Up’ is a platform that has been established to empower youth leaving residential care in order to create a generation that will never give up. Therefore it aims to create a safe and inclusive society, for youth leaving residential care before or after the age of 18 with the support of state and non-state stakeholders. Services provided under this platform include job opportunities and career guidance, scholarships for higher education, psychological counselling, legal support, peer support, an emergency hotline and an information database.  For further details visit www.gnglk.org "
"National Dengue Prevention Week: Don’t let dengue mosquitoes sting us","2018-09-29 01:15:54							0						 				1280"," The dengue pandemic is once again trying to penetrate our nation. However, ‘The National Dengue Prevention Week’ campaign which commenced on September 26 is doing its utmost to eradicate and prevent the virus in Sri Lanka. The dengue prevention campaign is carried out jointly by the CMC, Health Ministry, Special Presidential Task Force, the Environment Police and the Tri-Forces.   Consultant Community Physician of the National Dengue Control Unit, Dr. Preshila Samaraweera, spoke about the dengue prevention week, and the programmes which are conducted throughout the week, “We conduct two national dengue control weeks every year. Usually it is conducted just before the monsoon period. When we see the pattern of dengue of patients throughout the year, there is a seasonal peak from May to July and October to January. The seasonal peak typically coincides with the South Western monsoon and the North Eastern monsoon.   We conduct our sessions in various health divisions in our country which are called MOH areas (medical officer of health division). We have 355 MOHs in Sri Lanka. We categorize those MOH areas into three considering the density and probability of dengue in that region. The categories are: priority high risk, high risk and low risk. We have had 50 priority high risk MOH areas and 125 high risk areas. The other areas are low risk. During the week we conduct programmes in the priority high risk areas on all 7 days, and 5 days for the high risk areas. During this week we get the support from the tri-forces and the police to conduct the sessions. Such personnel are allocated into teams of three. Further within the MOH areas, we select high risk grama niladari divisions. Usually a grama niladari division consists of 500-700 houses. Each team is responsible for getting the cleaning of potential breeding cleared by respective households. The teams must visit and inspect every house, institute, school, constructive site hence any potential breeding places. Post inspection they ask people to remove unwanted water holding containers that promote breeding. The teams also educate the people of the area and help them identify breeding places. The respective PHI (public health officer) will inform the Grama niladari and religious leaders in order to have shramadanas to clean the areas.”    We conduct our sessions in various health divisions in our country which are called MOH areas (medical officer of health division). We have 355 MOHs in Sri Lanka She noted that on September 28 that they have selected schools to be inspected. The education ministry has issued a circular to inspect and have a shramadana campaign in all the schools of the country. But the priority high risk area schools are inspected and cleaned with more attentiveness.   She elaborated on the status of dengue in our country in contrast to the preceding years, she said, “dengue has reduced significantly, from 150,000 (January- September 2017) to 38000 cases this year ( January- September 2018).    Many factors have contributed to this reduction. When there is a large outbreak, the trend is normally that the following years will have a reduction in cases, because many people got the disease previous year. Every 5- 6 years we have a cyclical outbreak, due to zero type change. This is because the dengue virus has 4 types. For instance when we get an infection from the type 1 virus, we would not get the type 1 virus again. But, if a person, who has already contracted the type 1 virus and is later exposed to the type-2 virus they can contract the disease again. The significance of last year was that after 9 years the type 2 virus re-entered our country. Many people have not got exposed the type-2 virus, hence this facilitated the dengue outbreak last year.”   She also said that the reduction in cases is attributed to the actions taken by the health ministry, as they have allocated 1500 labourers this year to control the breeding of mosquitos and to carry out daily inspections of specified areas. Hence, every day waste such as coconut shells, salmon tins, buckets, tyres and empty containers are cleared by such personnel. Therefore, the number of breeding places in the country would reduce.   She spoke about the dengue vaccine that was much discussed about in the previous years, “ one of the vaccines is still under trial within our own country. There is another vaccine but the advisory commission has not accepted it in our country, because there is an issue in the Philippines regarding that vaccine.”   Speaking of dengue management in hospitals in our country she said, “Usually in our country the fatality rate of dengue is very low, last year we had 186 000 dengue patients but 440 deaths. In our country we are managing dengue patients very well. It is up to the standard of other countries such as Singapore and Thailand. Such dengue riddled countries have got together and follow a similar dengue management guideline and treatment techniques. There is no specific drug however to cure dengue yet.”   In her concluding remarks she said, “ In order to efficiently manage the dengue menance we must change the behaviour of the people in our country. We have to inculcate the behaviour of disposing waste. Then only can we substantially reduce dengue in Sri Lanka. To change this behavior and the culture of our people is a major challenge we face. We do many programmes with the education ministry to educate and spread awareness to children of proper waste management practices. We want waste management to become a natural habit. Further, clearing waste should be done on a daily basis and not only when an outbreak occurs. For instance, Some homes are quite vigilant when an outbreak occurs, but afterwards they begin to neglect waste in their homes. Therefore, the key to prevention of the epidemic is through environmental management. Some homes have bird baths, ponds and stagnant water in gutters that are heavily polluted. There must be a mechanisms to maintain them. As a further prevention mechanism chemicals are being used to destroy larvae and fogging is done to kill adult mosquitoes. However, we are trying to use chemicals at a minimum because such chemicals can cause resistance and it can also cause other diseases in people.”   "
"Knowing your blood report","2018-09-26 09:59:26							0						 				402","Blood tests have become such an integral part of disease diagnosis and treatment process that when you go to a doctor, more often than not, you are asked to obtain a blood report related to your condition. That’s why we decided to bring you a series of articles to provide information regarding blood tests; ordered commonly. Dr. K.A.C. Wickramaratne, Consultant Haematologist, Senior Lecturer in Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ruhuna, answers our queries in this week’s edition of Health Capsule with regard to blood tests.   “I strongly recommend the interpretation of any laboratory test to be done by the requesting clinician”, stresses Dr. Wickramartne. He explains that this process should be followed because despite the findings can be considered normal it can sometimes be a clue to a disease. Therefore, getting test reports interpreted by any person other than the one who requested it is of serious concern and should be avoided for the safety of the patients. Also, each laboratory test should ideally be requested by a doctor following a thorough history and a physical examination of the patient, so that only the relevant lab tests are requested. A Full Blood Count, the most commonly requested haematology test globally, is the topic discussed in this week’s edition of Health Capsule.   What is FBC?Full Blood Count (FBC) or Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a very useful test for the diagnosis of diverse conditions. Full or complete is a relative term as newer machines come with more and more added parameters with unique advantages in diagnosis. Even though it bears simple three letters FBC, it is a battery of tests with diverse information of blood cells. Nowadays, the test is done using fully automated analyzers.To understand what FBC is, we should know first what is analysed in this test. Blood can be separated into a liquid part plasma and solid – formed elements cells. FBC analyzes these cells.   Red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes) are analyzed in machines mainly to show how much of these cells are present per unit volume of blood. In addition, it gives some qualitative parametres such as changes in cell size, presence of abnormal cells, and presence of young or immature cells and even predicts the possibility of presence of some unique diseases such as Dengue fever in some cases.   How do I prepare for a FBC?A blood sample for a FBC can be given at any time of the day. It is collected as a random sample. However, early morning is ideal for any test. But changes throughout the day are subtle and are therefore of no concern. However, physical exertion, some drugs (such as prednisolone), smoking etc can affect FBC results, so are worth notifying your doctor when he is interpreting the results. It is better to give the sample after about 20 min rest if you were walking briskly.   Blood collection is best performed without a tourniquet. If a tourniquet is applied it should be applied immediately before venipuncture and removed within a minute. Blood from a vein, rather than from an artery is taken, as is the case with many tests. The sample will be perfect if venipuncture is neat, if the blood is drawn in to a syringe without much effort and without any bubbles, if the correct volume is filled into the tube; where a special agent to keep the blood from clotting, is pre-added, and mixed gently by 5-6 inversions. Samples, when transported and stored at temperatures between 21 – 27 0 C, can be analysed even after 48 hours to obtain accurate FBC results.   What is the information that can be garnered from a FBC?Results of the lab test and clinical manifestations of the disease should always be analysed together.Red cell parametresThese include Haemoglobin concentration (Hb - amount of oxygen carrying pigment) and red cell count (RBC or RCC) per unit volume of blood and haematocrit (HCT) or packed red cell volume (PCV) a measure of total red cell volume per unit volume of blood as a percentage].Normal values (or more accurately the reference values) of these parametres vary between different age groups, sexes and during certain physiological states such as pregnancy. So it should be interpreted with correct reference range for age, sex and physiological status. Higher values than upper limit is called polycythemia. It is a group of disorders needing further investigations. Values below the lower limit is called anaemia. It is a manifestation of a disease, thus should be investigated. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measure of red cell size and it is very important to understand the type of anaemia. When it is high it can be vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. When it is low it can be iron deficiency or thalassaemia. Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH) is a measure of Hb content in red cells and lower values can be indicative of iron deficiency or thalassaemia.These are only a few examples of the vast amount of information that can be collected from red cell parameters.White blood cell parametersThese include total white cell count (WBC) per unit volume of blood and absolute and relative percentages of each white cell subtype [we call it differential count (DC)]. Higher or lower total number of white cells and changes in DC can indicate infections or even serious diseases such as blood cancer. The variations in DC could be indicative of simple viral infection or bacterial infections such as leptospirosis, pneumonia or urine infection. Even allergic conditions, parasitic diseases such as filariasis, can subject DC to unique changes.The WBC count and DC can change with physical exertion, smoking or some drugs such as prednisolone. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when interpreting WBC parameters as well.   Platelets   Platelets are needed for stoppage of bleeding when we have wounds. The number of platelets per unit volume of blood is platelet count. Lower and higher values indicate diseases and can endanger life by spontaneous bleeding within the body or by “clot” formation in brain etc respectively. Platelet parametres available in automated FBC give clues on progression of platelet disorders.   Can we compare FBC results of different laboratories?The comparison of results between different laboratories cannot be done and should be discouraged unless the laboratories use similar machines and similar procedures. We call it standardisation and is yet to be established in Sri Lanka. When monitoring of FBC is needed with regard to a patient, it has to be done from the same laboratory throughout the monitoring process. Looking for any accreditation status ISO 15189 or CAP would give additional security or trust on quality or the reliability of what you receive as the FBC report. The presence of consultants to supervise and presence of qualified MLTs in a medical clinical laboratory is very important.Is it good to get FBC done as a routine on our own?As we have previously mentioned, any test when requested, should have a purpose and should be interpreted by a qualified doctor.   It has to be linked with symptoms, signs, age, sex, physiological status etc.  Just reading counts and comparing it with references given is inadequate and can mislead. This can happen when patients try to get reports interpreted by laboratory personnel or blood collection officials (phlebotomists). In a laboratory haematologists or pathologists, doctors or consultants related to laboratory medicine with relevant training can interpret FBC parameters. Other laboratory personnel are not qualified and competent to interpret these within the clinical context.  Unless clinician recommends and educates you to monitor your counts, obtaining random counts and getting them interpreted by an unqualified person is therefore inadvisable.   Can FBC results be erroneous?Yes. In any part of the world even with strict quality control, random errors are possible, but rare. Accredited laboratories try to control all potential errors. Most of the errors associated with FBC are due to errors in the sample collection and processing before analysis. If we elaborate a little on this, a traumatic venipuncture, froth formation (air bubbling inside syringe), pushing blood into the tube through a needle, vigorous shaking of tube with blood, exposure of blood to very high temperatures and marked delays in analysis all can affect FBC parameters adversely. Frequently falsely low platelets counts are seen due to these errors.   To generate accurate results, all the FBC machines should be properly installed, calibrated and maintained as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality control should be available for daily runs as well as external quality assurance at regular intervals. The availability of external and internal quality is not sufficient unless they monitor, review and act on results of quality control. Qualified, trained and competent laboratory personnel are therefore mandatory.  As for the possibility of a laboratory to perform any other test from the same sample, the answer would be ‘yes’. Commonly a sample collected for FBC can be used to perform blood picture, ESR, malaria or any other blood parasites examination, HbA1c (a test useful to monitor diabetes), blood grouping, reticulocyte count and Hb electrophoresis etc.   In a nutshell, FBC is a battery of investigations giving clues on how healthy your blood cells are. When used wisely it gives a large amount of information for the clinician for proper diagnosis and care. Quality of FBC results depend on many factors and collection errors are the most important. Remember not to rely on ‘interpreters’ of FBC (or any other test report) for your health. It should be done by a qualified doctor. When you select a laboratory for FBC (or any other test) accreditation status, presence of qualified team including presence of Haematologists to supervise are good points to remember.  "

"POLITICAL CIRCUS HITS TOWN Leaders in suites, drunken supporters fallen on streets","2018-09-11 00:10:07							0						 				1398","  	Thousands want to see there is quick action to punish the corrupt	This was an election promise that has to be kept at all costs, whatever the circumstances may be It was a circus all right, acrobats, jugglers and jumpers galore, while mothers were afraid to send their children to school, workers stayed away from their workplaces, some offices closed early. The organisers of the protest were unconcerned about the loss to children of education, loss to the economy by offices being closed.Their only focus was on themselves and getting back to the grandeur of power. Far from bringing the government down, many JO supporters were seen fallen in drunken stupors, lying on streets, some rescued by the ambulances introduced with the help of India by this government and hospitalized. One man died later of a heart attack. It was good to see few women among the supporters transported to Colombo who was gifted with packets of Chicken Biriyani, packets of cigarettes and arrack.It showed that the female of the species is wiser and far harder to fool than the male!Their promise to bring 200,000 supporters was just their usual boastful talk, they could only muster about 20,000 supporters.Namal Rajapaksa and Dilan Perera have never been famed as mental heavyweights, so their ridiculous statements after the circus was over, far ahead of the break of dawn, should not be taken seriously. The tax authorities should question the sourcing of the funds used for this and where they came from.One wonders why there were no verbal attacks on this charade of a protest and the inconvenience caused to the public, by those three prosperous, well-fed businessmen, robber barons as they were named in the media, who vented their wrath and fury against the Government, in no uncertain terms at a fireside chat recently. Namal Rajapaksa and Dilan Perera have never been famed as mental heavyweights, so their ridiculous statements after the circus was over, far ahead of the break of dawn, should not be taken seriously. The tax authorities should question the sourcing of the funds used for this and where they came fromOne of them openly called for a dictatorship. His benefits from dictators earlier on are no secret. Do they condone the white vans, abductions, murders and the rampant unprecedented level of corruption in the Rajapaksa regime?Another bemoaned the fact that government servants were given an increase in salaries while businessmen were taxed to the hilt.Still, another spoke about takeovers which had been done by the previous government but gave the impression that it was the fault of the present one.Perhaps age has dimmed his brain. It seems a pity that their wisdom hasn’t increased along with their bank balances. There are none so blind that those who will not see! I must commend the comments by Dhammika Perera and Merrill J Fernando in this context. I would like to know from the first three I mentioned whether they would have dared to hurl these attacks at the time the Rajapaksa family were ruling the country. I dread to think of what their fate would have been.They are going far beyond the peripheries of freedom, now in existence and abusing it like some in the media do too.The previous government did not focus on education; perhaps as many of them are uneducated, they value brawn more than the development of the brain. This government has increased the Mahapola allowance to Rs 4,000/-, given laptops to schoolchildren, built new buildings for 9,000 schools all over the country, given insurance to schoolchildren.So much investment has been to ensure an educated future generation which can take the country forward with the desired intellectual ability to do so. There have been over 137 housing projects launched under the leadership of Sajith Premadasa by this government.The fact that the government allowed the protest is again, a tribute to the freedom and democracy that exists today. This in sharp contrast to the protest during the Rajapaksa regime at Rathupaswala, in which several protestors were killed.The citizens of Colombo followed the lead of the government led by the President and the Prime Minister in ignoring the protest, no cheering squads form Colombo lined the roads.Lands are continuing to be returned to rightful owners in the North and in the South too, this is being done to those who lost theirs through the injustice of one kind or another. The fact that the government allowed the protest is again, a tribute to the freedom and democracy that exists today. This in sharp contrast to the protest during the Rajapaksa regime at Rathupaswala, in which several protestors were killedThere has been a vast creation of employment, prices of medicines reduced, salaries increased. The percentage of those affected by dengue in Colombo has dropped by 64% in comparison with 2017. There is no vulgar extravagance in public spending. No VIP of the government has used public funds for memorials for their families. VIP’s wives and sons do not fly to N’Eliya for baths or to ride their horses.To my mind, what thousands of others including me want to see, is that there is quick action to punish the corrupt in the former regimeand in this too if they are guilty of corruption.That is my grouse. Slow action in that respect. This was an election promise that has to be kept at all costs, whatever the circumstances may be. We also have Nihal of CJC fame jumping in like a Bull in a China Shop to give his professorial bill a hand, in stating that there was no impediment in the pseudo-Emperor contesting the Presidency again.The latter has unfortunately not changed his clothes, literally or metaphorically and Nihal may find that visions of CJC become more than a blast from the past in the minds of the people.Political Leaders must act like Statesman with dignity and fortitude through all seasons, “..meet with both triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same.”The Prime Minister has been the epitome of this throughout his political life, a worthy example to the second string of young leaders he has groomed in the UNP."

Concerning our lifespan from womb to tomb, and even further in case of illegitimate conceptions or illegal exhumations, Sri Lanka Police is entrusted with the bounden duty of shouldering the constitutional responsibility and ensuring the safety of the general public of our motherland.Adopting the Buddhist words of wisdom, “Dhammo hawe rakkhathi  dhammachari” (One who lives with the Dhamma is protected by the Dhamma) as its motto, while wearing the emblem bearing a dauntless tusker in the middle and the dharma chakra (Dharma Wheel) on the head, Sri Lanka Police is dedicated towards maintaining law and order while safeguarding lives and property of all Sri Lankans.This is considered to be one of the major organizations among the three State institutions, which were initially established in this country and its glorious history and the 152nd anniversary is thus celebrated with great vim and gusto.Sri Lanka Police also marks the inception of the first security service in Sri Lanka. The history of the security service of this country goes back to the reign of King Pandukabhaya and this service owes its origin to the position named, Nagara Guththika. It has gradually evolved up to the Dutch and Portuguese eras. After occupying the maritime areas of the country in 1796, the British established a Police Service in this country.The Police Force was further streamlined under the regulations imposed by the Act bearing No. 14 passed under the British Crown in 1806 and at the time the Police Force consisted of 28 Police Force Constables. ""This is considered to be one of the major organizations among the three State institutions, which were initially established in this country and its glorious history and the 152nd anniversary is thus celebrated with great vim and gusto""Payment of salaries to the Police Force was made with effect from July 9, 1833. Then, 47 Police Stations were established centred on commercial cities and 585 Police Officers were deployed for city protection duties.The Maradana Police Station was recorded in history as the First Police Station to be established in this manner.With the appointment of Mr George William Robinson Campbell as the first Inspector General of Police on September 3, 1966, as per the provisions of the Police Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, the inauguration of the Police Service as an organization in this country took place Constitutionally.The said date has been declared as the Police Day. Since the appointment of Sir Richard Aluvihare on January 6, 1947, as the first Sri Lankan Inspector General of Police, the occidental aura emanated from the Police Service has begun to be overpowered by the Sri Lankan spirit.At present, Sri Lanka Police functions under the Ministry of Public Administration and Law & Order and has become a solid Government institution, which consists of 64 Functional Divisions, 42 Territorial Divisions, 491 Police Stations with a strength of more than 90,000 Police Officers.The term ‘Polis’ has been derived from the French language and it means, ‘The guardian of the civil administration’.There is no other public institution than Police organization, which faces greater challenges in a country, where the civil administration is in effect due to the absence of internal disputes.The Sri Lanka Police, which has encountered three internal civil disputes, has faced many daunting challenges subsequent to the war situation prevailed for three decades in North Eastern Provinces.The duties of a Police organization in other countries are investigation of crimes, crime prevention, maintenance of law and order and traffic management.However, the professional role of a Sri Lankan Police officer is played in a more complex way.In addition to the basic police duties such as crime investigation, crime prevention, maintenance of law and order and traffic management, the citizens of the country currently expect the police to perform tasks such as implementing laws on liquor and narcotics, prevention of communicable diseases like dengue, protection of forests, coastal conservation, wildlife conservation, prevention of illegal sand mining and illegal excavation, even though there are separate Government bodies which are functioning to implement such environmental laws.At present, even the safety of the railway crossings is ensured under Police supervision. Thus, the duty of the police officer has become extremely complex. On the other hand, it brings us great pleasure to think of the sense of confidence Sri Lanka Police has inspired in the Executive, the Legislature and the general public for choosing us to assign a significant share of all these tasks.In other countries, usually, the Police officers are not assigned to other duties.However, the Sri Lankan Police are deployed for the performance of other duties and a different structure has been designed for that purpose. The officers of Sri Lanka Police are discharging those duties on a daily basis and sometimes even the officers of the Special Task Force, which is the elite paramilitary forces unit of Sri Lanka Police, might assume the role of a valiant soldier, while discharging ordinary Police duties.Sri Lanka Police that has inherited a proud history of 152 years, is offering many services covering various fields to more than twenty million Sri Lankans.Protecting lives and property of Sri Lankan citizens, Sri Lanka Police have presently become a bosom friend of the general public and it stands upright like a giant tree above a thick canopy of praise, blame, commendation and criticism while confronting all the difficulties and challenges around the clock in both sun and rain.The number of Police Stations that was 437 in 2015 have been increased up to 492 to date by the present Inspector General of Police, Mr Pujith Jayasundara, who pays special attention towards improving the basic facilities and service facilities necessary to fulfil the public needs efficiently by bridging the gap between the public and police. This provided a great relief for the people who had to travel a long way with great difficulty to get services from Police.New Police Stations have been established by further segmenting some of the larger Police Divisions. This has further reduced the population density of a respective Police Station and therefore those people have been able to get their services more efficiently.Furthermore, taking measures to develop human and physical resources in Sri Lanka Police with the intention of ensuring the security of the society in a peaceful country can be perceived as a huge achievement of the citizens of this country.This becomes evident when analyzing statistical data of 15 years in which the tendency to talk about criminal incidents have increased. Criminal incidents were also reported during the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 when compared to the present. However, since news articles on war had occupied more space on newspapers, incidents of crimes did not attract much public attention then.After 2009, headlines related to war had been replaced with headlines about criminal incidents, creating a basis for discussion. That is not a factor which should be construed as an increase in crimes. ""The number of Police Stations that was 437 in 2015 have been increased up to 492 to date by the present Inspector General of Police, Mr Pujith Jayasundara, who pays special attention towards improving the basic facilities and service facilities necessary to fulfil the public needs efficiently by bridging the gap between the public and police""Through the application of modern technology for investigating crimes, Sri Lanka Police has been able to initiate a significant development in the field of investigation.A great assistance is being given by Scene of Crime Officers (SOCO) who have undergone a proper training, officers and hounds of Police Kennels Division, Fingerprint Officers and Photographers of Police Criminal Records Division to facilitate the investigations and to identify criminals.At a time when the entire world is shrinking into a small global village, even the criminals in our country have gained access to the modern technology under globalization and show a tendency to employ modern technology and communication methods to commit crimes.Confronted with the challenge of protecting people from those who commit organized crimes, while being members of crime networks, Criminal Investigations Department is taking measures to shoulder their responsibility and all Police Stations of the Island are also extending a great support in that regard.May Sri Lanka Police endure through time executing its legendary mission!The writer is an Attorney-at-law, Police Media Spokesman and the Director and of the Police Media Division."
"To Dr. Ramya Kumar’s Article Doctors, MOH, Free Education et al","2018-08-21 00:04:05							0						 				1386","Right of ReplyRead with much interest a response to my article of July 27, 2018, in particular and to most other articles of mine on the health sector and medical profession in the DM, titled “Do away with Medical Officers of Health? A response to Kusal Perera” by Dr. Ramya Kumar, an academic in the Medical Faculty of the University of Jaffna. Appreciate very much the initiative to engage in discussion on this very vital topic that most have kept away to date.  Reading through Dr. Ramya Kumar’s response, I feel there is some misreading of what I have been arguing and making observations on, and that needs brief clarifications and explanations.  1) Dr. Kumar says in “yet another article” I have been “slamming the medical profession”, implying I have always been “slamming the medical profession”. In conclusion, Dr. Kumar says “I urge Perera to separate his contempt for the medical profession and the Government Medical Officers’ Association(GMOA) from his analysis of the public health sector…..”  I have always been holding the GMOA leadership as a “medical mafia”. I would continue to do so, until and unless the GMOA leadership changes course to play a responsible, civilized role within the health sector and in society. As for the medical profession, yes, I do say, it is no more the “noble profession” it was. As a “profession” the medical profession has over the past decades given up its moral and ethical standards and is no more different to all other corrupt professions; the legal, accounting, engineering, the academia etc. Yet I do accept there are very good medical doctors as very good lawyers, engineers, accountants, academics et al. Where I hold “good doctors” at fault is on their silence and their reluctance to stand up to the GMOA mafia. My “criticism of the medical profession and the private practise is valid” says Dr. Kumar.  2) Yet Dr. Kumar says “…his writings are confused and often unsubstantiated”. A point made is that, my “antipathy to the medical profession” led me to “undermine the students’ call to protect ‘free’ education”. I was thus supporting the government’s effort to privatize medical education says Dr. Kumar, “taking a questionable position on SAITM”.Glad Dr. Kumar raised this issue of “free education” along with “private medical education”. My position on “free education” had nothing to do with simplified sloganizing of “free education” by not only the students, but by the academics and the GMOA too. “Free education” in the anti SAITM protests was only a popular cover for the very sectarian demand by GMOA.   My position on “free education” is based on “Sessional Papers No.43 of 1944”, commonly known as “Kannangara Reforms”. Sadly, most in the “anti-SAITM” campaign did not know what this “Sessional Paper” is about and those gullible students brought on to Colombo streets have not even seen a copy of it. In June 1944, when it was adopted by the State Council, there were over 1,100 private schools managed by Missionaries and the Buddhist Theosophical Society along with State owned “government” schools. “Kannangara Reforms” never ever proposed to “nationalize” these private schools. It never proposed education “free of charge”. It allowed even government schools to levy “facilities fees”. Private schools that could not afford a well paid tutorial staff was “assisted by government”. All schools levied fees, with government schools not making it compulsory.   “Free education” was NOT “free of charge” education as these students and Dr. Kumar would want to believe.Today we have more than 44 totally private schools (including Chundikuli Girls’ School) within our national education system, even after PM Bandaranaike’s government in 1962 nationalized a vast majority of assisted and private schools. Pupils in these private schools are taught the same curriculum and the same syllabi. They sit the same G.C.E O/L and A/L exams with all other students from government schools and compete for admissions to all faculties in State universities.    Free education and private medical education issues raised as ‘matters of life and death’ have no relevance and validity in the context of present day education The call against private medical education Dr. Ramya Kumar stands with, has no validity with eight medical faculty Deans sitting in the SLMC accepting and registering private medical colleges and universities for Sri Lankan students to graduate as medical doctors with only the ERPM (another tuition industry monopolised by medical doctors) required to practise medicine and join government service. Is it where the private medical college is located that decides “privatizing of medical education”? If private medical education is opposed on principle, why wasn’t the KDA fee levying medical faculty opposed along with SAITM?  Free education and private medical education issues raised as ‘matters of life and death’ have no relevance and validity in the context of present day education where everything has been com-modified with absolutely no protests from any quarter during the last 30 years and more. Private companies own “International schools” that have yet to be opposed by this fake “Free education” campaigners. Nor do they question, the massive private tuition industry that makes a mockery of Kannangara Reforms that established a “national education system”, accepted the “right to education” with equal opportunities on a level playing field. The role of the State was to create that opportunity for the majority who could not afford such education to their children.   Let’s also not forget,those who fight to safeguard “free education” never speak nor oppose fee levying courses in their own universities and the academia that sympathized and supported student campaigns never avoided teaching in these fee levying courses for extra income. They also ignore all foreign university degrees offered and privately tutored here and professional degrees and diplomas from private institutes and organizations held valid in local employment.   There always was a market-based education sector that had expanded without limits within the ‘free market economy’ and without any opposition from “free education” campaigners.  3) The present role of the position ‘MOH’ and that of the medical doctors holding that position needs serious dialogue. Dr. Kumar’s details as to why and how the British colonial rulers came to establish a Medical Officer Health (MOH) post in preventive healthcare is accepted and is history.The 50’s and the 60’s, was when even politicians were honourable men and women unlike today. Not only the MOH, everyone else in the health service from top to bottom were duty conscious and discharged their duties honestly. The whole public sector was that then. Monitoring of field work then came under an OIC who was a Senior PHI in the MOH division. This responsibility was brought under the MOH from around 1964.  My assumption, Medical Doctors of “today” as MOH have failed miserably in their discharge of duties, with spread of Dengue used as one example is based not only on numbers I quoted, but on pathetically degenerated professionalism and politics of the GMOA that results in medical officers as MOH neglecting their duties and responsibilities. The claim by Dr. Kumar that “They oversee service delivery at the community level, including maternal and child health, family planning, and communicable and non-communicable disease prevention, while carrying out medical consultations at maternal and child health clinics” is therefore the point of contention. Except attending maternal and child health clinics, MOH is an almost absent officer in all else. They are comfortable remote controlling all monitoring work from their offices. May be Jaffna is different, as noted by Dr. Kumar.   Rapid and unplanned urbanisation mentioned as reason for recent spread of dengue, is only half true with MOH rarely seen or heard in most anti dengue campaigns carried out with police personnel, Local Government Councillors and DS office personnel. It is a fact that dengue cannot be successfully controlled without community support and participation. It is also a fact, community support and participation have to be mobilized by MOH and his staff. That is what goes missing with medical doctors as MOH. Their ego with the “tie and the stethoscope” do not allow them in the field as the PHI and the Public Family Health Officers (Mid wives) do.  True the post of MOH is no glamourous post for medical doctors. But that gives them enough time for PP in their own area, especially in rural society. And in Colombo and suburbs that provides them an added reason to demand “National schools” for their children.   As for my proposal to shift medical doctors posted as MOH to area GP work, does not in anyway reflect “Colombo dinner table talk”. That also does not replace the medical doctor with para medics in curative health. Instead it provides people with a government GP in their own area, they now have to pay for, unless they go to a government hospital, where the OPD often doesn’t run for more than three hours a day. Well trained para-medics for community preventive healthcare, is one I borrowed from J.H.L Cumpston (Director General, Health Services of Australia) who was commissioned by then Ceylon government and whose Report in 1950 explains the rational for it. Yet it was only a proposal, and is open for dialogue, without doubt."

"New acquisitions weigh on Hemas 1Q bottom line","2018-08-16 00:02:20							0						 				1119","The recent new acquisitions weighed on the bottom line of the diversified conglomerate Hemas PLC during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 (1Q19), the interim financial accounts released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.The earnings for the quarter under review fell 20.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.554.3 million, on revenue of Rs.13.5 billion, up 21.3 percent YoY.The earnings per share for the period fell to 96 cents, from Rs.1.21.Hemas Group CEO Steven Enderby said the reduced interest income due to the utilization of cash reserves to acquire Atlas Axillia was a key reason for the reduction in earnings during the quarter.The finance income for the quarter under review fell 57 percent YoY to Rs.95.4 million.He also identified higher interest costs relating to higher working capital due to the strong growth in pharmaceutical distribution and loan financing for the group’s new logistics park as another key reason that hampered the group bottom line. The finance costs for the period rose 66 percent YoY to Rs.119.21 million. “All three of these investments should contribute to earnings from 3Q,” Enderby said.The group operating profit for the quarter under review grew only by 3.5 percent YoY to Rs.895.7 million.“The operating profit growth has been impacted by losses at N*Able, our IT technology solutions business, coupled with a weaker macroeconomic environment with sluggish consumer demand as disposable incomes have been dampened by the rising costs from rupee depreciation and increased taxes,” Enderby said.The group’s consumer business revenue stood at Rs.5.4 billion for period under review, up 36.2 percent YoY. The growth in the consumer sector, excluding Atlas, stands at 6.8 percent. The operating profit of the segment grew 8.1 percent YoY Rs.569.3 million.Hemas said during the quarter under review, the market conditions domestically remain depressed with most market commentaries indicating low or negative growth in most major FMCG categories.The group’s Bangladesh business experienced revenue growth of 6.1 percent, following the Kumarika relaunch last December. However, Enderby said profitability still remains a challenge due to the heavy marketing spend post-launch. The group said Atlas performance has been on track in 1Q with revenues up by 8.8 percent over last year and break even in operating profits in line with its normal seasonal performance trend.The revenue of the group’s healthcare segment rose 24.7 percent YoY to Rs.6.4 billion but the operating profit fell 2 percent YoY to Rs.498.8 million. Hemas said the price regulations brought in for certain pharmaceutical drugs and depreciation of the rupee against the dollar was a major operational challenge it had to face during the quarter under review.The hospitals run by Hemas saw 60 percent occupancy during the period but the revenues and profitability were flat compared to the same quarter, last year, when the occupancy levels were higher due to the dengue epidemic. The group’s pharmaceutical manufacturing and marketing subsidiary Morison posted revenue of Rs.844.3 million and operating profit of Rs.83 million for the quarter under review. Meanwhile, Hemas leisure, travel and aviation business recorded total revenue of Rs.792.4 million reflecting a growth of 16.2 percent for the three months under consideration. The segment was also able to narrow its operating loss to Rs.68.1 million, from Rs.127.6 million a year ago.The group’s logistics and maritime business recorded a revenue growth of 15.4 percent YoY to Rs.718.3 million. The operating profit improved to Rs.216.6 million, from Rs.188 million a year ago.During this period, the Colombo port witnessed a YoY growth of 15 percent.The Esufally family has a 61 percent stake in Hemas through various investment vehicles, while Norges Bank, Norway’s giant wealth fund operating under its Central Bank, has a 2.99 percent stake in the company.Franklin Templeton Fund also has a 9.7 percent stake in Hemas.During 1Q19, the two new entrants to the top 20 shareholders of Hemas were Phoenix Venture (Pvt.) Ltd with a one percent stake and Kopernik Global All Cap fund with 0.69 percent.  "
"Right of reply Do away with Medical Officers of Health? A response to Kusal Perera","2018-08-16 00:00:01							0						 				1668","Two weeks ago, the , on July 27, 2018, carried yet another article by Kusal Perera slamming the medical profession. In this piece, Perera argues that increasing the number of medical doctors by establishing new state medical faculties will be useless because the doctors they produce will occupy redundant administrative positions in the public sector. Perera attributes “the continuing decline in the health service” to medical doctors holding administrative positions like the Medical Officer of Health (MOH), a position that he suggests should be done away with, and be replaced by trained paramedical workers.    	The MOH is not a glamorous position in the medical hierarchy which places hospital-based specialists at the apex	 	I have met a number of dynamic MOHs working tirelessly with limited resources While elements of Perera’s argument are compelling, such as his condemnation of the autocratic nature of the medical establishment and his critique of public sector doctors engaging in private practice, Perera’s social positioning and his deep-seated contempt for the medical profession blinds him to the critical role played by the MOH in the preventive health sector.     MOH and the health system The MOH is a vestige of the health units system introduced in British Ceylon by the Rockefeller Foundation who arrived on the island in the early 20th century to deal with the hookworm scourge on tea plantations. Disgruntled by an uncooperative Planters’ Association, the Rockefeller Foundation shifted its sanitary efforts to the Western Province where the inaugural health unit was set up in Kalutara in 1926.   The health units system gradually expanded to cover the entire island. Serving the demands of imperial medicine, medical doctors were assigned to health units where they worked towards promoting maternal and child health and preventing the spread of communicable diseases. Thus medical doctors did not usurp the MOH position in the 1970s as per Perera’s argument.   At present, the country is divided into 330 plus MOH areas, each led by a MOH.These areas are further split into Public Health Inspector Areas, which, in turn, are divided into Public Health Midwife areas, each (ideally) covering a population of ~3000 to 5000. The MOH teams up with a public health nursing sister, public health nurses, public health inspectors and public health midwives, to deliver preventive health services in the relevant MOH Area.   The MOH is not a glamorous position in the medical hierarchy which places hospital-based specialists at the apex. Yet, these doctors are essentially the linchpin of the preventive health sector, coordinating between MOH public health teams and district level health administrators. They oversee service delivery at the community level, including maternal and child health, family planning, and communicable and non-communicable disease prevention, while carrying out medical consultations at maternal and child health clinics. They also play a crucial role in disease notification, the School Health Programme and other community-based health education initiatives, and are responsible for food sanitation, and occupational and environmental health.   Admittedly, many of these functions are not carried out optimally owing to crippling staff shortages at all levels. Cadre positions lie vacant in many remote and rural areas. In the Northern Province, for example, field midwives often cover two public health midwife areas, with grave implications for public health. As Perera points out, the Government needs to invest much more in this system.     Misplaced criticism Perera suggests that we do away with the MOHs as it is “a wholly irrelevant position in community life.” He attributes the rise in dengue to the incompetency of MOHs. It is unclear on what basis he makes these claims. It is well recognised that dengue is a product of rapid and unplanned urbanisation compounded by a crisis in garbage disposal. The health sector cannot do very much about the spread of dengue without the necessary support from government and non-health sectors. It is farfetched to attribute the failure of the preventive sector vis-à-vis dengue, the resurgence of leprosy, and even a lack of sanitary facilities,to MOHs being doctors.   Moreover, Perera’s allegations do little justice to the many socially minded MOHs who do not engage in private practice. While working in the health sector, I have met a number of dynamic MOHs working tirelessly with limited resources. In addition to running primary care clinics and overseeing the work of public health inspectors and public health midwives, they have been responsible for initiating various health promoting activities within their respective MOH areas. Examples from Jaffna District include the promotion of organic home gardening and the use of a nutritious mix of grains and cereals (‘saththa maa’) manufactured locally to address malnutrition, which is rampant in the Northern Province. While Perera labels such activities as completely irrelevant, he unwittingly contradicts his own position that prevention is better than cure.   Also notably absent in Perera’s analysis are the successes of the preventive health sector in spite of medical doctors holding positions of administration. For instance, its role in the much proclaimed low maternal mortality ratio and, more recently, WHO certification for malaria elimination. Despite such achievements, financial allocations to the preventive sector have declined over the years as more and more funds are channeled toward curative care. Rather than focusing solely on doctors, Perera should expose the Government’s role in Sri Lanka’s health sector crisis.     Need for clarity Perera’s criticism of the medical profession and private practice is valid. However, his writings are confused and often unsubstantiated. For instance, during the SAITM crisis and student boycott, Perera’s antipathy to the medical profession led him to undermine the students’ call to protect ‘free education.’ In fact, he supported the government’s efforts to privatise medical education by taking a questionable position on SAITM.  His latest article (Daily Mirror,  August 10th 2018), an attack of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, suggests that the joint statement of Deans of state medical faculties on SAITM was manipulated by the Federation of Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Associations (far from the truth in most if not all medical faculties). Perera is unable to see that the establishment of for-profit medical degree-awarding institutions like SAITM could jeopardize medical education in the country.   Many of the positions Perera articulates in his articles, including the denigration of MOHs, smack of Colombo-centric middle class elitism; trashing the public sector, including state hospitals and universities, is standard dinner table conversation in Colombo. In his pro-people analysis, Perera seems to have forgotten the ordinary families who rely on the public sector, including the MBBS qualified MOH (not a private sector specialist), for their maternal and child health needs.     Words of caution Yes, medical doctors are not the ‘saviours and guardians’ of the health sector, and they should embrace other healthcare professionals instead of obstructing their entry into the health sector. Yes, the maldistribution of medical officers should be addressed rather than placing them in administrative positions in Colombo. Having said that, however, Perera should be wary of trends in other parts of the world where physician administrators are increasingly replaced by MBA degree holders and others of that ilk who are trained to maximize cost-effectiveness and profits in the health sector. Second, Perera should think twice before supporting ‘task shifting,’ a particularly neocolonial approach that has its basis in the assumption that poorer communities in rural and remote areas can be served by a ‘low cost’ paramedical healthcare workforce. Finally, I urge Perera to separate his contempt for the medical profession and the Government Medical Officers’ Association from his analysis of the public health sector in order to offer a more informed critique in his writings.   [The writer is attached to the Department of Community and Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jaffna]"
"Rising temperatures to carry big price tag in steamy Sri Lanka","2018-07-27 13:14:48							0						 				983","By Amantha Perera(Colombo) THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION: Dinesh de Alwis has lived all his life in Ratmalana, a suburb of Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo. When he was young, he remembers, he would rush outside every day at 4 p.m., to play with friends after school.“Now if you send the kids out at four, they would faint of heatstroke. It’s that bad,” said the 40-year-old father of two, of the searing heat that has become part of everyday life here.Already steamy Colombo is expected to be one of the South Asian cities hardest hit by temperature hikes linked to climate change – hikes that are already being seen in many cities around the world.As temperatures continue to rise, Sri Lanka’s Western Province – which includes Colombo – is likely to see a 7.5 percent decline in living standards by 2050 “compared with a situation without changes in average weather”, according to a World Bank report released last month.That is likely to have far-reaching national consequences as one of the nation’s key economic centres struggles to keep cool, the report said.“This is a substantial drop, with potentially large implications for the country, given that the province contributes more than 40 percent of Sri Lanka’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP),” the report said.Muthukumara Mani, a co-author of the report and the World Bank’s lead economist for South Asia, said that the impact will vary across different sections of the population, with outdoor workers or the poor unable to afford air conditioning, for instance, particularly hard hit, and energy costs rising for many.“A rich household could be in a position to mitigate the impacts better than a poorer household, which would not have the financial capacity to do that,” Mani said. He said the construction industry and health systems are likely to feel the heat in particular.Some families say they are already running up higher bills due to rising temperatures.“When we were small we never used fans. It was never so warm that you could not sleep. Now we can’t sleep most nights without the air conditioner,” said De Alwis, who said he pays close to US$70 each month for air conditioning.Sunimal Jayathunga, director of the national Climate Change Secretariat noted that the country’s “adjustment to rising temperatures has not been ideal and (has been) too slow across the board”.In the past decade Colombo and the Western Province have been beset by worsening dengue outbreaks. Research by Sri Lanka’s University of Peradeniya has shown a link between rising temperatures, changing rainfall and outbreaks of the mosquito-carried disease.According to the World Bank report, more than 800 million people in South Asia will be affected by rising temperatures by 2050 and Sri Lanka in particular will see a loss of at least US$12 billion a year by 2050 if adequate measures are not taken to deal with temperature rise.Temperatures in the region are expected to rise by up to 3 degrees by 2050, the report said.Jayathunga, of the climate secretariat, said his agency was putting together plans for each of the country’s nine provinces to tackle climate change impacts. The plans are expected to be ready by the mid-2020s, he said.He said Colombo needs to deal with a range of problems, from worsening flash flooding to a lack of clean water. “But tackling rising temperatures is one of the urgent ones,” he said.Dealing with rising temperatures will require making Colombo’s people more aware of measures to adapt, such as conserving water and constructing buildings with more ventilation, Jayathunga said.“But all this takes time,” he said.The World Bank’s Mani said governments in South Asia have been focused on natural disasters and finding ways to deal with them, which has left more gradual and less visual threats, such as temperature hikes, overlooked in some places.“Lots of the time countries pay attention to disasters like floods and drought and make policy changes, but they should also look seriously at these kinds of slow-moving shifts that are happening, that could be equally dangerous,” he said.  "
"Global campaign to  test and treat Hepatitis Eliminating the disease is the immediate need of the hour","2018-07-27 12:54:47							0						 				3976"," Hepatitis is one of those infections that people are less aware of. Unless tested, one wouldn’t detect this viral infection as its symptoms appear only in selected instances. Hence the global campaign launched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) aims to test and treat this infection before it spreads to the rest of the world population. Statistics reveal that around 325 million people around the world are living with viral Hepatitis while 290 million of them are unaware of the symptoms.   In view of World Hepatitis Day, which is annually celebrated on July 28, the Daily Mirror spoke to Dr. Lalindra Dias, Consultant Physician at the District General Hospital – Nuwara Eliya, who elaborated on the types of Hepatitis, symptoms, treatment and prevention.    Inflammation of the liver Hepatitis is the inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis infections are prevalent among countries with a poor socio-economic status. As such Sri Lanka too is affected as a result of varieties of Hepatitis infections. Infections could be contracted by both males, females and children. The condition can be self-limiting or could progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver cancer.   Types According to Dr. Dias there are both infectious and non-infectious causes of Hepatitis. “Infectious causes include Hepatitis A,B,C,D and E while there are various non-infectious causes,” he said. “Among the most common non-infectious causes is Nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) also known as Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver disease. Alcohol is another leading cause of non-infectious Hepatitis. Various medications such as paracetamol and anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief should be avoided. This also includes limiting the excessive usage of herbal preparations. Other causes included autoimmune diseases and genetic and familial causes,”the doctor added.  Infectious types “Among the infectious types of Hepatitis, Hepatitis A and E are most common,” Dr. Dias added. “These two types are mainly transmitted through faeco-oral transmissions. These transmissions occur when patients don’t have good toilet practices and due to lack of poor sanitation. In turn they touch food and water and the infection is carried on. This is a common infection during floods and among people who live in slums and close communities. However there are vaccinations to prevent the Hepatitis A infection. On the other hand Hepatitis B and C are transmitted through unprotected sexual practices with unknown partners. Another reason is due to sharing of intravenous needles among drug users and very rarely through emergency blood transfusions. But nowadays the transmission through blood and blood products is extremely rare due to widely available high-tech screening programmes. These two types could also be transmitted from an infected mother to a foetus,”he explained.  Speaking further Dr. Dias said that other infectious causes such as dengue fever and leptospirosis could also lead up to Hepatitis infection.    Non-infectious types As mentioned before, NASH is one of the common causes of non-infectious Hepatitis. “This is common among patients with diabetes, high cholesterol and those who are obese,” Dr. Dias continued. “In order to prevent NASH it is important to control diabetes and reduce weight. In addition to that, high intakes of alcohol could lead to Hepatitis infections and patients could end up having cirrhosis,”he affirmed. How do you know that you are infected?Some of the acute features include the following : 	High fever	Body aches, lethargy and fatigue	Severe loss of appetite	Jaundice – discolouration of eyes and skin	Passage of dark-coloured urine      nSevere abdominal pain on the right side.   “If one develops the above symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor,” Dr. Dias added. “Usually Hepatitis A and E improve without many complications. But Hepatitis B and C could lead to chronic Hepatitis and patients could ultimately end up with cirrhosis. It could sometimes also culminate in conditions such as liver cancer.”he said. Prevention and treatments He further said that the Hepatitis infection could cause grave consequences such as cirrhosis, cancer and ultimately death. “Therefore it is important to prevent it to the best of your ability,” he continued. “This could be achieved through safe sexual practices, cutting down on excessive consumption of alcohol, not sharing intravenous drug needles, controlling diabetes and reducing weight. If you have the above symptoms, it is important that you seek medical attention. The doctor will do a couple of blood tests while testing liver enzymes and doing an ultrasound scan of the liver.” he said. According to Dr. Dias, Hepatitis A and E require symptomatic management. “This includes controlling the temperature, keeping the patient hydrated and avoiding liver-toxic drugs. While at the hospital, the doctors will safeguard the patient from further liver damage. Hepatitis could also be cured through vaccinations; for example Hepatitis B is already included in the National Immunisation Schedule. It is also advisable to get the Hepatitis A vaccination before travelling to countries such as India and Africa,”he stressed.  Aftercare “Once a patient has recovered from a Hepatitis infection he or she should take precautions,” he added. “As such a patient shouldn’t take painkillers such as paracetamol, anti-inflammatory drugs and also avoid the excessive usage of herbal medications. Patients should also cut down on the excessive consumption of alcohol and recreational drugs. Those who have been infected with Hepatitis A and E should engage in good sanitary and hygienic practices so that the infection isn’t transmitted to others. If a child has contracted Hepatitis, it is advisable that he or she doesn’t attend school during this period. It is the same with adults and patients are advised to rest as much as possible. In order to prevent Hepatitis B and C there are anti-viral agents that could be administered to patients,”he said.  World Hepatitis Day 2018  According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) viral hepatitis B and C are major health challenges, affecting 325 million people globally. They are root causes of liver cancer and leads to 1.34 million deaths every year.   Hepatitis B and C are chronic infections that may not show symptoms for a long period; sometimes years or decades. At least 60% of liver cancer cases are due to late testing and treatment of viral hepatitis B and C. Low coverage of testing and treatment is the most important gap to be addressed in order to achieve the global elimination goals by 2030.   WHO will focus on the theme: ‘Test. Treat. Hepatitis’ in view of World Hepatitis Day 2018. WHO organises events and activities with the aim to achieve the following objectives globally, in regions and in countries:   	 To support scale-up of hepatitis prevention, testing, treatment and care services, with specific focus on promoting WHO testing and treatment recommendations;   	 To showcase best practices and promote universal health coverage of hepatitis services;  	 To improve partnerships and funding in the fight against viral hepatitis.   "
"Eliminating  stigma associated with Mental disorders","2018-07-27 12:48:46							0						 				1842","   A mental health issue is like any other medical issue, or is it? What would you do if you  have fever, or severe abdominal pain? The majority of us would not hesitate to seek medical help, if we think that it may be something serious. But are we honestly giving mental disorders the same attention that we give physical illnesses? Even though 1 in every 4 people worldwide is likely to suffer from a mental disorder, according to the WHO, many people are reluctant to seek help, due to the stigma associated with mental illnesses. Today, on Health Capsule, we have consulted Dr. Udena Attigalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, in the hope of obtaining more information on mental health disorders, as education is an important component of removing the stigma associated with mental health issues.    It’s not all black and whiteMental health issues are a spectrum, varying from mild to severe, explains Dr. Attygalle. The spectrum for each category of mental health issue consists of various signs. Milder symptoms are named as ‘problems’, while moderate to severe symptoms are likely to be diagnosed as a ‘disorder’. For it to be diagnosed as a disorder it has to affect one’s life significantly, the doctor clarifies. Have you ever felt down, hopeless, losing interest in the things that you usually love, even for a short period of time? Then it’s likely that you have been placed in the spectrum of mental health issues; specifically that of depression, at some point in your life.    Common mental health issuesIf you take a random patient suffering from mental illnesses, you are more likely to get a person who is depressed, anxious or a child with a behavioral disorder, rather than a person who fits the image of what the society preconceives as‘mental illness. This, according to the doctor, is because these are the most prevailing mental health issues in today’s society.    Physical illnesses vs mental illnessesIf you or one of your loved ones has ever suffered from a mental health issue, you may have heard advises like ‘Get over it, it’s all on your mind’ and ‘You are not sick’. We ask the doctor, “Are these true? Is it all in our minds?”. Just as there are changes in your body’s chemical composition when you are physically ill, there are chemical as well as physiological changes associated with mental illnesses as well, he explains. But, since most of these changes occur in specific areas of the brain, which is an extremely complex organ, these changes are difficult to detect, he clarifies further.   Take, for an example, Dengue fever and Severe Depression. While both have the capacity to cause much harm, even death and depression cannot be diagnosed or monitored through blood tests, unlike dengue fever. Some of these changes can be observed through advanced imaging like FMRI, but are difficult to use as diagnostic tools.    Underlying causesMost Mental Disorders have a strong genetic component associated with them. In simpler words, the risk of developing a mental illness is higher in people whose close relatives are having mental disorders, when compared to the general population. But mental illnesses have a strong association with environmental factors like stressful life events and bereavements as well. But how these affect a person varies from each individual. Out of two people living in the same kind of environment undergoing similar life stresses, only one may develop a mental health issue. It’s also affected by the social background of a person, especially the social support he receives. A child with absentee parents and no friends is at a more risk of developing a mental health disorder.   Mental health issues have an association with the personality of the individual as well. A person who tends to look at the negative side of life and gets easily disheartened will be more susceptible to depression than a person with a more optimistic view of life.   There is something called the Bio Psycho Social model, which is used to describe the aetiology of mental health disorders, explains the doctor. This demonstrates that mental disorders are a result of a combination of Biological, Genetic factors, Psychological and social factors rather than due to a single aetiology.    Negative effects due to stigmaStigma is mainly twofold; stigma that has a link with the public which may sometimes cause you to avoid a person showing signs of ill mental health, and self stigma, where a patient fears stigma from the society and avoids either social interactions or seeking medical attention.   Generally, the help seeking behaviour is very poor in the society with regard to mental health. The stigma associated with mental ill health plays a major part in this regard. Patients and family members tend to ignore the symptoms until the patient is severely ill and needs to seek medical advice. The major disadvantage of this situation is that in most mental disorders, the potential for complete cure drastically reduces by delaying treatment.   In addition, the quality of life of a patient with a diagnosed mental disorder is significantly lowered due to the wrong perceptions the society has of him or her. The prospect of finding employment reduces and the patient being isolated from the society leads to poor self esteem and depression. This may make his condition worse. The first thing that we need to understand when it comes to the stigma associated with mental disorders is that contrary to popular belief, the majority of the patients with mental disorders can be treated. They function well in the society just like you and I.    Eliminating stigmaWhat is our role in reducing the stigma associated with mental health? Accurate information and being educated about the condition is the main enemy of stigma, explains Dr. Attygalle. Knowing that the genetic and environmental causes as well as individual factors contribute in causing mental disorders, understanding that there is a wide spectrum of mental disorders is prevalent in the world and that many of them are treatable is a good initiation to understanding about mental disorders.   Having positive experiences associated with mental health conditions is another way of reducing stigma. You may have a friend who has suffered from depression, but copes better than you and I when faced with a stressful situation. Understanding that they are humans who are simply suffering from an illness is also crucial.   The role of the media associated with mental health is large, though sadly, more frequently than not, this opportunity is used to spread negative messages about mental ill health. Understanding how the media and entertainment industry reflect on mental disorders is not always accurate, that violence and aggression associated with mental disorders are exceptions, rather than the rule. This is vital towards eliminating stigma associated with mental health.   One final message to our readers who are or who know someone who is suffering from a mental health issue: Even though it’s not visible outwardly, mental disorders can be equally painful as physical illnesses. Do not hesitate to seek help from a qualified psychiatrist, since as we highlighted previously in the article, the chance treatment being successful is high, in seeking medical care early.     "
"Tragedy doctoring the Health Service What JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa proposes is to produce more doctors for the private sector at public expense","2018-07-27 01:20:23							1						 				2443","JVP MP moves wants two more medical faculties, saying country has only 50 per cent of required doctors In addition to Teaching Hospitals medical faculties need more resources and facilities to turn out quality productsAlready the existing medical faculties do not have the required full-time teachersNone of the successful campaigns against diseases had doctors involved-all were by PHIs and PHMs Can more medical doctors reverse the continuing decline in our health service? JVP member in Parliament Dr Nalinda Jayatissa has moved two private member motions to establish medical faculties at the Uva Wellassa and Moratuwa Universities, with Badulla and Nagoda Hospitals proposed as “Teaching Hospitals”.   His argument is that Sri Lanka has only 50 per cent of the required number of medical doctors and medical faculties in State Universities can only accommodate 1,200 to 1,300 medical undergraduates each year-therefore, the need to establish two more medical faculties to increase the number of student intake.   There is something rather sneaky in his proposal to have Nagoda Hospital as the Teaching Hospital for the proposed Moratuwa Faculty. Why go that far when there are two other hospitals much closer in Panadura and Bandaragama?Besides that, though a medical doctor, the JVP politician fails to understand that to produce a ‘quality’ medical professional, a Teaching Hospital is not the only necessity.   A Medical Faculty needs many more resources and facilities to turn out quality professionals.   Though the GMOA and Deans of Medical Faculties in State Universities cry foul over the SAITM Medical Faculty, they are selfishly silent on the quality of education in their own medical faculties including Rajarata, Ruhuna (Karapitiya) and Eastern University.   Most faculties don’t have permanent qualified teaching staff and are wholly dependent on “visiting” professors and lecturers from elsewhere.   The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), throttled by the GMOA mafia in decision making, has evaded this lapse and the necessity of having a permanent teaching staff in their draft on ‘minimum standards in medical education’ by allowing medical professionals in Teaching Hospitals to be counted as teaching staff.   This is one of the many reasons, the GMOA as a trade union, should be completely barred from running for positions in the SLMC and the reason, why the SLMC should be restructured anew to give it better representation from other professions and to “societal” interests.  The whole approach in shaping our health service with medical doctors and the argument that we need more medical doctors raises the vital question, “what we as a society expect from our health service?”   Do we want more and more patients to seek outdoor and indoor treatment in hospitals for medical doctors and specialists to have a thriving private practice?   Do we have to keep increasing the number of medical doctors to treat increasing numbers of patients? Is that what we are looking for?  The argument for more medical doctors, the JVP MP Dr Jayatissa is echoing, is one borrowed from his own ilk in the GMOA.   If the existing number of medical doctors is 50 per cent of the required number, he should explain, why medical doctors are posted in numerous offices to attend to administrative work.   On the Health Services, Minutes Gazetted in October 2014 that comes after the GMOA mafia endorses it, there are 324 administrative posts strictly for medical doctors.   There are also 341 MOH positions for medical doctors. Lately, there are other stupidly unnecessary office positions created in the 25 RDHS offices with designations like MO-IT, MO - Planning and MO-Health Education, while in Colombo Hospitals, there are other posts that keep cropping up like MO-5S and MO-QC.  These office-based positions totalling around 800 don’t need medical graduates.   While increasing numbers of medical doctors take over such idling administrative positions, the overall health service is on the decline.  The alarming spread of Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is one proof.   The spread of dengue is mainly due to the callous disregard of the once very effective monitoring and regulating mechanism that was then under a Senior Public Health Inspector (PHI) but now controlled by medical doctors sitting in MOH Chairs.  With medical doctors in office as MOHs, not interested in enforcing monitoring proper and regulating, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence in most Provinces although the highest incidence of DF/DHF is seen in the Western Province (44.9% in 2007).   In the recent past, the incidence of DF/DHF has been more marked in the NCP (4.8% in 2004 vs. 11.8% in 2007), Wayamba (10.2% in 2004 vs. 15.9% in 2007) and Sabaragamuwa (6% in 2004 vs. 12.2% in 2007) and with 35,008 cases reported in 2009 with 346 deaths, according to the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry.   With all the rhetoric available from medical officers manning decision-making and implementing positions in the health sector, during the first three months of 2018, there were 14,627 reported cases of DF/DHF.   The result is that we have hospitals with DF/DHF patients cramped everywhere in the hospitals.  In Sri Lanka, this needs to be stressed and emphasized with the GMOA mafia wanting to portray and project the medical profession as the sole saviour and guardian of our health services. It is a total and an absolute lie.   It wasn’t medical doctors who worked towards lifting Sri Lanka’s health status to that of the more advanced countries. From hookworm to poliomyelitis, from malaria to whooping cough, smallpox and filariasis, all outbreaks and recurrences were eradicated through a well monitored and regulated community based preventive healthcare service handled by paramedical servicemen and not by medical doctors.   PHIs played a very vital role in carrying out an islandwide awareness on personal hygiene and developing cleaner sanitation. They were responsible for creating a new generation that paid more attention to personal cleanliness and better family hygiene. It was also PHIs and the Midwives who played a very committed role in making immunization and vaccination programmes a success in the 1960s.  In the 1980s with WHO support and guidance the anti-leprosy campaign was efficiently and successfully carried through to declare leprosy as eradicated in 1992, without medical doctors playing any significant role.   Now that medical doctors have taken over leprosy prevention, there is once again a warning of a possible increase in leprosy cases.   Yet, another interesting piece of news was from Moneragala, when the now hyped Gam Peraliya development programme was launched over a month ago.   It was reported, 25,000 households were without proper toilets. A special allocation was set aside for their construction. Truth is, if the MOH was effectively monitoring and regulating community health in his or her area, this lack of toilets should have been remedied, long before Gam Peraliya was launched.   This also raises the question why allocations for their construction were channelled through the Divisional Secretariat (DS) and not through the MOH.   The fact is, MOH is now a wholly irrelevant position in community life even after the spread of dengue fever.   MOH is not seen or heard of even in dengue prevention campaigns that are carried through Development Officers in DS offices, LG councillors and local area Police, at times backed by the STF as well.  Therefore what we should as a society demand from our health service is a very strong preventive community healthcare system to reduce numbers admitted to hospitals.   A preventive healthcare system makes hospitals in the curative healthcare system less important. Sri Lanka’s proud status on health rankings was achieved on a comparatively very low budget that depended more on preventive health care and sanitation than on curative healthcare and medical doctors.  Preventive community health care with trained paramedics checking on households regularly is certainly not as expensive as curative health care with sophisticated hospitals, long lists of expensive medicinal drugs prescribed by medical doctors and specialists, supported by semi-professional staff like MLTs, Radiographers and Physiotherapists.   Sri Lanka needs to give more importance to preventive community health care over curative healthcare that should have a strict referral system.  We are wasting money on curative health with heavy investments going in search of the most modern and expensive health equipment to meet ever-increasing numbers of patients.   This is due to GMOA backed medical professionals holding all key positions in the health hierarchy who are not “pro-people” as they project themselves to be.   We also need to break out of international norms and standards, where and when necessary to design programmes for our own need(s).   We should get back to the well-knit preventive healthcare service with paramedics at the community level that we had till the 70s. This can be redesigned under specially trained senior PHIs designated as “Area Community Health Officers” (ACHO) to clear out this mess. The ACHOs should also have well trained “Public Health Midwives” (PHM) in the field.   The present WHO norm of having one PHI for 10,000 persons and one PHM for 3,000 persons should be revised for a more practically valid ratio.  It is humanly impossible for a PHM to care for 3,000 pregnant mothers and infants within a month that includes home visits too.  So is it with PHIs. The present MOH who is a medical doctor can thus be repositioned as the GP in outpatient dispensaries in ACHO divisions.  A community based preventive healthcare system would help reduce the heavy cost of producing medical doctors through low-quality medical faculties proposed at public expense.   Experience during past decades proves that increasing the numbers of medical doctors produced does not in any way improve the health of people. They only get comfortably absorbed into the thriving private sector health industry that lacks full-time medical doctors.   Thus, what JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa actually proposes is to produce more medical doctors in the private sector health industry at public expense.   The medical profession now only feels money, not human pain.  "
"Leptospirosis : Be aware of severe rat fever!","2018-07-12 00:00:02							0						 				2285"," 	This bacteria is excreted when these mammals urinate and ends up in soil and water	 	The initial acute or septicaemic phase lasts about one week Leptospirosis, commonly known as rat fever, is mainly a disease infecting people working outdoors. This is a disease that occasionally causes serious consequences and even death. It’s a bacterial infection brought by animals. Though it’s called rat fever, the germ is carried by other mammals like cattle, pig, goats, dogs, raccoons and bats. This bacteria is excreted when these mammals urinate and ends up in soil and water. The germ can enter humans through abraded skin (scratches, wounds, eczema and shoe cuts or through intact mucous membrane/mouth, genitals)This disease is a biphasic illness. The initial acute or septicaemic phase lasts about one week. The second phase is an immune phase with circulating antibodies (IgM) accompanied by excretion of the bacteria in the urine.   Contest in Sri LankaLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease and one of the main communicable diseases in Sri Lanka. The disease is endemic in Sri Lanka with occasional outbreaks.Consultant Transfusion Physician Dr. Kumudini Gonsalkorale told the Daily Mirror that the farming community and those who spend much time with animals were susceptible to the disease in Sri Lanka.“In the rural areas, it’s the farmers and agricultural workers who are mostly affected. In the urban areas the disease often affects the slum dwellers,” Dr. Gonsalkorale said.“The situation in Sri Lanka is pathetic. The death of the breadwinner makes the whole family destitute. Their voices are never heard. The illness never receives prominence because it mainly affects the lower income group. A death of a poor farmer never affects others. It is only the kith and kin of these poor people who suffer,” Dr. Gonsalkorale affirmed.“In Sri Lanka, leptospirosis is reported throughout the year. Annually there are two peaks in the disease incidence; at the time of the monsoons, a smaller one during March -May and a larger one during October - December,” she added Even with ICU care, 70% or more of those with lung haemorrages cause death. No definitive treatment is available for these patients with pulmonary haemmorrages Dr. Gonsalkorale According to the Epidemiology Unit, there had been a significant increase in reporting and identifying leptospirosis cases over the past few decades since identification of the first confirmed leptospirosis case in 1953. In the year 2008 Sri Lanka reported the largest outbreak of leptospirosis with 7423 suspected cases and 204 deaths. Subsequently, 4980 cases and 145 deaths were reported in 2009 and in 2010 the number of cases was 4553 with 121 dying.The highly endemic areas are Colombo, Gampaha, Matale, Kurunegala and Kalutara which are known to be overcrowded with agricultural communities and changing weather and environmental factors.The factors affecting prevalence of the leptospirosis in Sri Lanka can’t be investigated in to. Seasonal analysis is needed in the wet and dry zones corresponding with the main Yala and Maha agricultural seasons. The annual rainfall is mainly associated with the prevalence of leptospirosis in the wet zone while the agricultural environment associated with the prevalence of leptospiros is in the dry zone.   The new procedure has been effective that it has reduced the number of deaths reported from the sever form of the rat fever Dr. Welivitiya New procedures of control Dr. Gonsalkorale said that the pulmonary haemorrages (bleeding into the lungs) which is the severe form of this disease had a very high mortality rate.This is also called ‘Weil’s disease’ and it can develop after the acute phase as the second phase of the biphasic illness or can simply present as a single progressive illness. The outcome can become very severe.“Even with ICU care, 70% or more of those with lung haemorrages cause death. No definitive treatment is available for these patients with pulmonary haemmorrages,” Dr. Gonsalkorale said.“After considering the high percentage of deaths reported due to the cause of pulmonary haemmorrages, the National Blood Transfusion Service has commenced a procedure called Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) to control pulmonary haemorrages. This procedure was initiated by the Teaching Hospital of Karapitiya in 2016,” she said. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a treatment that removes plasma from the blood. The removed plasma is then replaced with a substitute. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. It helps carry blood cells and other substances throughout the body.Consultant Transfusion Physician of the Blood Bank Dr. Theshanthi Welivitiya said they had carried out plasma exchanges for more than 150 patients since 2016 with pulmonary haemorrhage and percentage of recovery was 70%.“The new procedure has been effective that it has reduced the number of deaths reported from the sever form of the rat fever,” Dr. Welivitiya said.“The only issue is that the Colombo South Teaching Hospital is an overcrowded hospital and once again accommodating patients in an ICU becomes a huge problem. The main problem faced is that this expensive machine used for the procedure has to be pushed from place to place in order to treat these patients,” Dr. Welivitiya added. Symptoms   Leptospirosis may present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. It may also mimic many other diseases such as dengue fever, influenza, meningitis, and hepatitis. Jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin) is a relatively common symptom in leptospirosis, but is also found in many other diseases involving the liver. However, following symptoms are common when it comes to leptospirosis.    Preventive measures   The disease can be prevented to some extent by taking precautionary measures, yet many folks are unaware of the disease or the preventive methods. If you are involved in occupations such as farming, mining, cleaning drains and canals etc. please be alert. The following specific measures can help to prevent leptospirosis.    	Removal of rubbish and keeping areas around human habitation clean.   	 	Keep animals away from gardens, playgrounds, sandboxes, and other places where children play.   	 	Appropriate, protective clothing, knee-high boots, gloves etc should be worn and wounds should be covered with waterproof dressing  	 	Use boiled water for drinking (chlorination is seldom useful, as virulent organisms withstand up to 4 Parts per million (ppm); filtered water is also not safe)   	 	Avoid walking in flood water   	 	Use the medicine called Doxycyclin which is distributed free by the health ministry to be taken as a preventive drug.    "

"Hairless by hair loss","2018-06-22 10:54:32							0						 				4418"," Everyone dreams of being proud owners to thick, luscious and voluminous hair. However hair loss stands in the way of making that dream a reality. Hair loss isn’t merely just fall of hair in excessive amounts. There may be medical complications involved that lead to loss of hair in chunks. When this happens alarm bells should ring in the mind and indicate that it’s high time to seek medical advice. Dr. Nayani Madarasingha,  Consultant Dermatologist, speaks to Health Capsule this week about hair loss, its causes and cure.   When to worry More than a thousand hairs reside on a healthy scalp. Each hair undergoes a growth cycle. “This cycle consists of 3 phases. The first phase is the growth phase where hairs undergo growth and this may extend to a time frame of a few years. This phase varies according to each individual,” explained Dr. Madarasingha. This is why the length and volume of hair differ from person to person.   “Secondly, the hair enters the catagen phase. Here the hair ceases its active growth and the connection of the hair fibres to the roots is lost. The final phase is the telogen phase which is the resting phase of the hair. This lasts for 3 months and this phase is common to people.   After each hair strand completes its life cycle, it will fall off after 3 months of the resting phase. A new hair strand will grow in its place from the hair follicle,” she continued.   According to the Dermatologist, an individual tends to lose 50-100 strands a day which is actually quite normal. So this kind of hair loss is no cause for alarm. However there are cases where hair is shed abnormally and the hair volume starts getting affected by the loss of hair. When this happens it is high time to receive treatment and prevent further hair loss.   Root causes Excessive hair shedding and hair thinning are the two reasons that take the blame for abnormal loss of hair.   There are several factors that lead to excessive hair shedding. “Firstly, it could occur as an acute phenomenon after a stressful event such as pregnancy, surgery, dengue, etc. At the end of the resting phase, hair strands should shed for the new ones to surface. However this circumstance causes an individual to lose even up to 90% of hair. On a more positive note, the lost hair can be replaced with new ones in another 3 months.   Drugs prescribed for certain diseases especially those taken to treat cancer affect the growth of hair and leads to an arrest in the growth of the hair strands, causing them to fall off. Other drugs taken for conditions such as cholesterol too lead to excessive shedding.   Hormonal imbalances and thyroxin deficiency in particular can cause abnormal hair loss. Diet issues, iron and vitamin deficiencies too lead to problems associated with hair loss. Certain medical illnesses may cause excessive hair loss as well,” stated Dr. Madarasingha.   Hair loss due to hair thinning, informally known as the balding process, is mainly hereditary and caused by genetics. “This type of hair loss is also referred to as ‘pattern hair loss’ as hair is lost gradually. This is seen in both males and females. In women, pattern hair loss may not always be caused due to genetics. Hormonal imbalances and complications such acne, polycystic ovarion syndrome can lead to pattern hair loss,” she accentuated.    Diagnosis If treatment is started early, this progression can be prevented and slowed down. “People tend to treat these conditions themselves and think that oil massages, etc will help recover the lost hair. However hair loss has become an issue that requires medical attention as it may be caused due to various medical reasons as mentioned above. It’s very important to identify the cause for hair loss suffered by an individual,” she advised.   There are various diagnostic methods available to target  the type of cause responsible for hair loss in a person. “An analytical examination is the most basic form of diagnosis where a thorough examination is conducted on the patient, also inspecting the patient’s family history on diseases and hair loss as well. There are special instruments that are used in the diagnosis too. Biopsies may be conducted, but this is a diagnostic method that is very rarely resorted to. Hair loss due to certain hormones and vitamin deficiencies can be identified simply by a blood test,” Dr. Madarasingha informed.    Treatment available   Many methods of treatment for abnormal hair loss are available and they are said to be safe and successful. Treatment is based on the diagnosis of the cause for hair fall. Topical applications on the scalp and oral tablets that should be continued on a long-term basis are common methods of treatment. “If a patient suffers from an advanced case of  hair loss, the common methods may not prove to be 100% effective. In such cases, the answer would be hair transplants,” she said.   A technique known as PRP ( Platelet Rich Plasma) is currently being used in hair loss treatment where a small amount of the patient’s own blood is extracted and the platelets in the blood are isolated and then injected to the scalp of the patient. “Blood platelets contain a component known as growth factor which will allow hair to grow back. This procedure too is said to be a safe and reliable one with positive results,” the Dermatologist assured.    Not just a female problem! According to the Dr. Madarasingha, conditions like pattern hair loss is not just restricted to individuals above 40 years of age or older. Sometimes people in their early twenties and even younger are susceptible to these complications. It’s often thought that hair loss is a complication that affects females only. However this is not true. Hair loss is impartial to both males and females alike. Females are simply worried about hair loss than males and tend to take action unlike them!  "

The count on the Perpetual Treasuries List is increasing by the day!!! THE ALL IMPORTANT NAMES ARE NOT FORTHCOMING THOUGH!!! WE WONDER WHY??? ILLS OF THE GOP  The Educated One says “the UNP will never defend thieves,” who made Ravi K the first Minister of Finance in this regime??? The one who claims “MY TASK IS TO GIVE NEW HOPE TO ALL UNP MEMBERS AND MILLIONS OF OUR VOTERS” Where we ask is the hope he has given to the millions of parents who still find it impossible to get their children into schools??? Does that not matter, or is that not one of his priorities??? As the new General Secretary of the Grand Old Party, he is going to solve ALL THE ILLS OF THE PARTY IN ONE FELL SWOOP!!! The UNP should consider itself privileged to have such a capable General Secretary!!! He is going to make the Impossible Possible!!! We will still be around to watch his stellar performance!!! Not so healthy Situ  The Healthy One who returned recently after capturing a post at the UN is such a humanitarian that he refused point blank to go into the overcrowded ward at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Hospital in Dambulla!!! Those poor women have no room TO EVEN SIT ON THE FLOOR, IT IS SO HORRIBLY OVERCROWDED, BUT DID ANYONE CARE??? Igp Step In Please The Traffic jams and Traffic Cops – yes, we have been taught to give merit where merit is due but the Traffic Cops of our country deserve NO MERIT for the inhuman delays and punishment they put us through, simply because they have absolutely NO IDEA HOW TO DIRECT TRAFFIC!!!THEY MAKE THE CRUCIAL MISTAKE OF FIRST PUTTING OUT THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND THEN TRYING TO DIRECT TRAFFIC!!! THEIR SENSE OF DIRECTION SADLY POINTS ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION!!! SO GOD HELP US ALL!!!If these idiots just leave the Traffic Lights on, THERE IS A SENSE OF DIRECTION AND A SMOOTH FLOW OF TRAFFIC!!! Perhaps it is time the IGP stepped in and brought a sense of direction to the lives of these misguided Policemen so that they will not continue to display their ignorance and inconvenience the public, like they do!!! Who cares As I have said before, we live in a world of declining moral values!!! They are tinkered and tampered with to the detriment of society.Sadly, our Sri Lankans, in general, seem to have lost their sense of values!!! The saddest and most detrimental part is that they have no politicians, no one at the top to guide them in what is right!!! Road repairs are being carried out in the daytime, when it is time for people to go home!!! The end result is the general public is inconvenienced but no one cares!!!Huge empty water tanks are left at random on the roads; near the parks, no one knows the purpose they serve, more importantly, no one cares!!! When it rains these tanks fill with water and breed mosquitoes, the mosquitoes, in turn, bring in the dreaded dengue and other fevers!!! Yet, no one cares; the empty tanks are just left standing!!! The other menace is garbage; our streets, highways and byways are polluted with garbage!!! Does anyone care??? Is there any punishment meted out to those who irresponsibly dump garbage???The reason for all this decadence is total lack of discipline!!! No one to impose discipline, no one to take action where action is required, so the people have also fallen into this attitude of  ‘WHO CARES???’There is no value attached to anything, whether it is in homes, schools, offices, public places; values are declining rapidly and falling to dangerously low levels!!! It is indeed a shame that the majority of Sri Lankans have lost their sense of self-worth!!! Sri Lankans, in general, used to be proud of what they wore, how they dressed, what they ate, how they went around, what they talked about. Now no one seems to care, it is really sad!!! More importantly, when a new product is introduced, irrespective of what the product is, the first lot you get is super but, as soon as they know the product has caught on, BANG goes the quality and no one cares about that!!!Why are our people so lackadaisical; why is it that maintaining QUALITY IS NOT IMPORTANT ANY MORE???

Why stoop to devalue the product we sell??? Why do we find it so easy to deceive our own countrymen??? Oh that one hundred days People are naturally taking their cue from the politicians, from what is happening around them!!!

Now they are trying to talk us into believing that there is this highly publicized 100-Day Programme, apparently drafted by Eminent Persons!!!One of our eminent Buddhist Priests said the 100-Day Programme has been copied from a USA Programme!!!Be that as it may, we are constrained to ask why it took over three years for them to even talk about a 100-Day Programme!!!More importantly, what did they hope to achieve in these 100 days???

"“  PM is the  best bet as UNP’s  Presidential Candidate  ”","2018-06-05 00:48:15							11						 				6354","Tourism Promotion Minister John Amaratunga during an interview with the  spoke about the political situation of the country and the reforms of the United National Party (UNP) which he represents. Excerpts:     Q  What is your analysis of the current status of the Government?There is no difference. The national Unity Government will continue. The Ministers representing Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in the Government are also doing their normal work. In fact, new subjects have been assigned to the ministers now.    Q  In the assignment of subjects, some institutions, such as the Department of Archaeology which was held by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, have been entrusted with Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. Why is that?I don’t know. I am yet to see the gazette notification. I cannot comment on it as a result. There is no change in the subjects I held as the Tourism Development Minister.    Q  As an UNPer with 40-years of experience how do you view the current status of the party?Had the UNP obtained an absolute majority there would have been no problem. We would have forged ahead with our own policies. Since we had to join hands with the SLFP to form the Government, there were differences. Nevertheless, we’re working together.    As a result of FCID operations, we have been able to minimize corrupt practices Q  How do you compare and contrast the UNP’s present situation with its past?During the regime of J. R. Jayewardene as the President, we had five-sixth majority. We could implement anything we wanted. Today, the UNP is only a part of the Government.    Q  How do you view the differences in terms of policies? There is one difference here. We could implement projects speedily during the past. That is because of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). Officials fear making decisions because of the FCID’s operations. They think twice before implementing a decision.   There are two aspects here. That is to mitigate corruption. As a result of FCID operations, we have been able to minimize corrupt practices. Everyone is careful to make sure that financial regulations are upheld. That, however, causes delays in implementing projects.   Q  Did you experience this personally in your ministry?Yes. We have to implement the digital advertising programme regarding the promotion of tourism. Officials fear bypassing the procedures. They insist on following the procedures. It has delayed the implementation of the programme, hence affecting tourism.    Q  What’s the UNP planning to do in view of the Presidential Elections? The Working Committee will decide who should be our candidate. Two Ministers have already said that UNP Leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should be the candidate. If the Working Committee decides, we will go ahead with it. Minister Mangala Samaraweera clearly said the Prime Minister would be the candidate. If he says that, it may be the final decision.    Q  What is your opinion?I think the Prime Minister stands a good chance of emerging as the winner at the elections.    Q  You see him as the best bet?Yes, at the moment, he is the best bet. That is because of the enormous experience he has regarding governance and foreign and economic affairs. In early 1970s, people used to talk about J.R. Jayewardene as a hopeless candidate. He was viewed as an arrogant person. Yet, he proved to be the best candidate for the UNP.    The Mahinda Rajapaksa group is also very strong. When the anti-UNP vote base is divided between them, we can emerge victorious  Q  There is a cry from the UNP backbenchers that young blood should be infused to the UNP hierarchy. What is your opinion?I’m not against that view. They should be given more responsibilities. They must understand one thing. I will cite one example. After I enetered Parliament, I remained without a portfolio for 10 years. I was just an MP. I continued to wait. Later, I was appointed as the State Minister of Finance. Since then, I have been getting portfolios. One shouldn’t expect ministerial posts immediately after entering Parliament.    Q  If the party must groom another leader, who do you have in mind?There are enough and more at the second level of the party. Ministers Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake are there. We also have Ministers Harin Fernando and Mangala Samaraweera. There are five or six people identified as potential future leaders. As time progresses, we will find a person to fill the vacuum.    Q  What are the policy changes you expect in the party?The UNP has the same kind of policies. They cannot be changed. We are a democratic party and believe in the private sector as the engine of growth.    Q  How do you view the chemistry between the President and the Prime Minister?They are on talking terms though some people may think otherwise. I do not see any difference of opinion between them. The Unity Government will continue operating during the remaining 18 months.    Q  As far as the UNP reforms are concerned, what do you think of the recent appointment of new office bearers to key posts such as the General Secretary?I think those changes are enough. There is no need to make any drastic changes to continue for the next 18 months. Drastic changes can be made after the next elections.    Q  How hopeful are you of winning the next elections?The SLFP group led by President Maithripala Sirisena is also strong. The Mahinda Rajapaksa group is also very strong. When the anti-UNP vote base is divided between them, we can emerge victorious.    Q  You had similar hopes during the Local Government Elections held on February 10 because the President and the former President did not unite. But the UNP couldn’t win . Why is it?That is true. There were various views expressed in this regard. We did not get the expected results.    These foreign nationals, who were assaulted, did not come to give evidence. They made a hue and cry, and left. We couldn’t punish wrongdoers as a result Q  What do you think of UNP Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake being denied a ministerial post despite making requests?Mr. Karunanayake played a major role in the installation of this Government in 2015. He worked very hard for it. There were allegations against him regarding the alleged Bond Scam. According to the report, he hasn’t been involved in any scam. There is no reason for him to be deprived of a ministerial post. He hasn’t been found guilty.    Q  How is the growth within the tourism sector?In 2010, there were only 400,000 tourists. Now, we get 2.5 million arrivals. Every month the number is increasing. At the same time, there are obstacles in our way. There was the closure of the airport and dengue epidemic. We have heard of a few incidents where tourists were assaulted. They have hampered the development of tourism.    Q  Some ambassadors raised this matter with you. What did they discuss?They sent travel advisories. When the Dutch tourists were attacked, they sent travel advisories. These foreign nationals, who were assaulted, did not come to give evidence. They made a hue and cry, and left. We couldn’t punish wrongdoers as a result.   We have to get our digital campaign right to promote tourism. We have to ensure the safety of tourists. We are trying to develop the domestic airports. We have to expand our international airport. We need to increase the number of immigration officers. We have to develop the railway system. Many tourists are willing to travel by train.   There are many airlines willing to land here. Our landing and parking charges are very high. We have to bring them down.    Q  The recent tax hike has affected tourist industry. Foreign nationals have complained about high charges for food and accommodation due to increased taxes. How do you see this?We have received complaints both from locals and foreigners about it. In general, people find it difficult to live. When the rupee value depreciates, the rupee component of foreign exchange earnings increases. That is a plus point. Foreigners get the benefit from this.      "
"Trump’s blockade is to  provoke regime change – Cuban Ambassador","2018-06-04 00:03:46							0						 				2393","Cuba’s National Assembly elected Miguel Diaz-Canel as the country’s President in April. Diaz-Canel followed Raul Castro who served two consecutive terms from 2008 when the health of his brother Fidel was in decline. Fidel Castro, who led the 1959 revolution that overthrew Fulgencio Batista’s dictatorship and ruled the country since died in 2016. The Daily Mirror talked to Cuba’s Ambassador in Colombo, Elena Ramos Rodriguez, on what may be expected from the new leader from a post-revolution generation, US President Donald Trump’s hardened policy towards Cuba, its effects on the Cuban people and Cuba’s response to the intensified economic blockade imposed by the US government.   Excerpts:   Elena Ramos Rodriguez Cuba’s new President Miguel Diaz-Canel was born a year after the 1959 revolution, representing a relatively younger generation of politicians. Does this generational shift point to a change in Cuba’s style of government in years ahead?I want to highlight the significance of the last session of the Cuban parliament, on April 18-19 when Mario Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez was elected the new President of the Council of State and President of the Council of Ministers. I think the new leader will continue the revolutionary process, will continue the development of our country, the development of our Socialism. Cuban people express their support for this electoral process. The people elect the members of Parliament, the Parliament elects the Council of State, and the Council of State elects the president. This process comes with the support of the people because a majority - 85.65% attended the polls to elect their representation in parliament, from each municipality. Voting is voluntary … if you vote it means you support (the process).   Diaz-Canel’s predecessor Raul Castro had started introducing certain changes- reducing the size of the state sector, encouraging more private enterprise, loosening some controls etc. with benefit to the economy. Will the new President continue on this trajectory?Yes. The Cuban government and people are all working on updating the Cuban economic model. It is a complex process. It’s changing not because of pressure from outside but for Cuban society, to establish the economic and social guidance. It is a broad process, with many meetings with people in their workplaces, residential places etc. In Cuba, the programme does not change with each president. The guidelines are adopted with the opinion of all the population – in different ways they participate in the process.    ""The Parliament elects the Council of State, and the Council of State elects the president. This process comes with the support of the people because a majority - 85.65% attended the polls to elect their representation in parliament, from each municipality  ""Former US President Barack Obama had started a process of normalization of Cuba-US relations, signalled by re-opening diplomatic missions in the two countries. Under Trump, this process is being reversed, and the economic blockade is being intensified. What will Cuba’s strategy be, to cope with this situation?I think Obama’s years demonstrated that Cuba and the US can live and co-exist in a civilized way. Interactions between both sides show that Cuba and the US can exist, respecting our differences and cooperating, for the benefit of both countries and peoples, at the same time. Wherever there is an opportunity, we can cooperate.   Opportunity such as …?To stop drug trafficking, terrorism, illegal immigration. Intelligence is not the interest of one country – it’s for both countries. We share maritime borders. We have to cooperate for example in maritime rescue, to save people. Or to avoid contamination of our maritime waters. Cuba wants to continue negotiating with the US government, but on conditions of equality and respect for our sovereignty. Cuba will not resign any of its principles. Principles are non-negotiable.   But the fact is that you have a US President whose attitude is belligerent. How will you face this situation?We have to face the new measures. In November last year the US Departments of State, Treasury and Commerce issued new provisions and regulations to implement and strengthen the blockade against Cuba - a week after the Nov. 1stvote in the UN General Assembly on the necessity to lift the blockade. These measures were in a new executive order of the President called “National Security Presidential Memorandum on Strengthening the Policy of the US towards Cuba.” They restrict travel of American citizens to Cuba, restrict commerce between the two countries. During Obama’s time it was more flexible on some issues, but the blockade was still there, especially in the financial/ banking sector.   In 2016 the US abstention (during the UN vote on lifting the blockade) was a hopeful moment. These measures confirm the regress of bilateral relations as a result of the decisions of the government of Donald Trump. It is also important to say, these measures ignore US public opinion of about 75% which is a great majority, and the international community, and of the Cuban immigrants in the US. The majority of Cuban immigrants want normal relations. Only a small group in Florida want to continue the blockade. This transformation ignores the majority of the international community. On Nov. 1st 2017 for the 26th consecutive occasion, the resolution on “The necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the USA on Cuba” was approved by the General Assembly of the UN, with 191 votes in favour and two against: the US and Israel, confirming once again the absolute international rejection of this policy. Cuba will continue to present the resolution as long as the embargo is in place. Unfortunately the resolution is not binding. But it’s a good step to demonstrate that the international community supports Cuba.    ""MediCuba, the company that imports and exports medical products, received a communication from the supplier Lindmed Trade of Spain, saying it could not supply the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin Lactate because the manufacturer Claris Otsuka refused to sell the goods because Cuba was subject to sanctions imposed by the US""The UN Secretary General in July last year presented a report, at the request of the members of the General Assembly, on the implementation of this resolution. Cuba said “the accumulated losses caused by the embargo during nearly six decades it has been in place amount to US$ 822 billion.” Can you give an example of how this translates into deprivation in the day to day lives of the Cuban people?The blockade affects all fields – business, health, education, agriculture. To give an example – in March 2017, MediCuba, the company that imports and exports medical products, received a communication from the supplier Lindmed Trade of Spain, saying it could not supply the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin Lactate because the manufacturer Claris Otsuka refused to sell the goods because Cuba was subject to sanctions imposed by the US.   Ciprofloxacin Lactate is a broad spectrum antibiotic used for adults and children in the treatment of respiratory ailments. Also for skin, soft tissue, bones and joints affected by bacteria. This is an antibiotic used in all hospitals. This affects the health of our people not because the government doesn’t give the resources but because we cannot buy from the supplier.   		I think the new leader will continue the revolutionary process, will continue the development of our country, the development of our Socialism			The ending of the embargo was approved by the the UN, with 191 votes in favour and two againsT			Cuba produces nickel. The company was unable to export 3,500 tons of it, produced in 2016 because they could not find a bank... 			The blockade is the main obstacle to the development of our country. 			The US wants to provoke a change of regime, by provoking anger of the people through shortages, by depriving them of food, medication.   			Cuba appreciates support provided by Sri Lanka in its fight against the US embargo			Our policy is to give what we have. Others give what they don’t use. Fifty-five per cent of state resources is allocated for budgeted activity 	Could you briefly explain the extra-territorial aspect of the embargo, how third parties – other states - are punished for having transactions with Cuba? An example?The case I just mentioned is also a good example of the extra-territorial impact. The supplier, the Spanish company cannot trade with Cuba. They too are affected. Legally they should be able to trade with Cuba. Also, many other companies have been sanctioned, fined, for doing business with Cuba.   To give another example, Cuba produces nickel. The company was unable to export 3,500 tons of nickel sulphide produced in 2016 because they could not find a bank that would open a Letter of Credit. The loss to the Cuban economy was $23,600,000.   In June 2016 the Netherlands mail and parcels company TNT returned to the Consulate General of Cuba in Madrid, two postal consignments addressed to the embassies of Cuba in China and Indonesia containing passports of Cubans living abroad. The company claimed that it had returned the consignments owing to corporate instructions related to the US embargo.   The rest of the world supports Cuba on the need to end the embargo, which is in violation of the UN Charter and international law. Can you explain briefly, what is the problem the US has with Cuba?The blockade is the main obstacle to the development of our country. The US wants to provoke a change of regime, by provoking anger of the people through shortages, by depriving them of food, medication etc. They want a regime change favourable to the US. It didn’t happen because the Cuban people stayed brave. This policy satisfies only the interests of a small minority of the American and Cuban-American extreme right-wing of South Florida, whose interest is to reverse the process of normalization of bilateral relations. It is a violation of human rights in general. We have a good economy but it would be better if we didn’t have the blockade. Tourism is greatly affected. People like to visit Cuba, last year we had four million visitors. Imagine if there was no blockade! American citizens are not allowed to travel to Cuba as tourists, it’s prohibited. They need a special licence from the Treasury.    ""I think Obama’s years demonstrated that Cuba and the US can live and co-exist in a civilized way. Interactions between both sides show that Cuba and the US can exist, respecting our differences and cooperating, for the benefit of both countries and peoples, at the same time. Wherever there is an opportunity, we can cooperate""Cuba sends its professionals like goodwill ambassadors to all parts of the world – doctors, teachers, artists, agriculture experts - demonstrating the high level of culture and education it has achieved for its people, in spite of the problems caused by its big neighbour. What is the secret of this achievement?Our policy is ‘internationalist.’ One of the main principles in our relations with other countries is that we share what we have. If we can provide doctors, we do that. Our policy is to give what we have. Others give what they don’t use. Fifty-five per cent of state resources is allocated for budgeted activity such as education, public health, social security, pensions. That’s why there is a high standard. We believe you must support everybody. You cannot have homeless people. A mother who cannot work because her child has a disability will be provided with a government pension. It is a policy that demonstrates that even a poor nation that has not too many resources - if it uses resources for the welfare of the people - can grow its human capital, and improve living standards of the people, despite major challenges it faces. This is, maybe, our ‘secret!’   Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba after the revolution and (in the words of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his condolence message on the death of Fidel Castro) “Cuba has been a great friend Sri Lanka could count on.” How can the Cuba-Sri Lanka relationship be taken forward?A. Sri Lanka and Cuba have historic bonds of friendship and cooperation. Sri Lanka established diplomatic relations in 1959 after the triumph of the revolution, at the very beginning. The first step was the visit of Che Guevara to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka and Cuba both entered the Non Aligned Movement (NAM) in the same year, 1961. Cuba received the presidency of NAM from Sri Lanka in 1979. We have a long history of cooperation in sports, education, health, agriculture. At this moment we are working on areas of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. In June, a delegation from Sri Lanka visited Cuba to follow up on implementation of an MoU between the ministries of Science and Technology of the two countries. Last year a Cuban expert visited Sri Lanka to share expertise on the control of dengue. We are also working on registering in Sri Lanka a Cuban product for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. It has an efficiency of over 80%, many people have saved their legs, avoiding amputation. Cuba sincerely appreciates the support provided by Sri Lanka in its fight against the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba for almost 60 years. On Nov. 1, once again Sri Lanka voted in favour of the Cuban revolution against the blockade in the General Assembly of the United Nations.  "

On May 28, the Daily Mirror in a front page news report spotlighted the lack of facilities like Intensive Care Units (ICUs) but we need to focus more on measures to prevent the epidemic.   The usual method is by having mass vaccination campaigns. But flu vaccines have not had a good track record and usually the vaccines have to be made with elements of the target virus and other substances. This takes time. But perhaps there is an even better option - prevention.   Dr. Joseph Mercola who publishes popular newsletters worldwide on health and well-being refers to the power to prevent viral illnesses by using the famous Ayurvedic herb – “holy basil” or thulasi in Tamil and maduruthala in Sinhala, that is also revered by Hindus.   It is a common herb that grows all over Sri Lanka and therefore is readily available and easily administered – just by eating the raw leaves in a salad or sambol. About five leaves by adults and three by children under 12It is a common herb that grows all over Sri Lanka and therefore is readily available and easily administered – just by eating the raw leaves in a salad or sambol. About five leaves by adults and three by children under 12. Many who know the value of it say it works because they eat these leaves often and have not had a serious viral flu attack for several years.   This herb’s stimulating powers have been recognized by ancient healers and sages. In India people venerate thulasi or holy basil as a sacred plant. It is a part of Indian households, typically grown in earthen pots in the family home or garden.   One of the most important reasons why it is so famous, aside from the fragrant flavour as a basil type cooking herb, is that it is one of the most effective adaptogens--an agent that helps our bodies adapt more effectively to stress caused by diseases.   But thulasi also has another beneficial side effect, and that is helping to prevent and treat viral diseases such as Influenza, Dengue, Chikengunya, Swine Flu and Bird Flu.   According to Dr. Mercola’s article thulasi or holy basil may improve your body’s overall defence mechanisms, including its ability to fight viral diseases. It helps speed up your recovery process if you suffer from illnesses such as swine flu or Dengue. It also strengthens your immune system.   These benefits may stem from thulasi’s highly complex chemistry. It contains beneficial compounds called phyto-chemicals -- naturally occurring compounds that plants produce to protect themselves against bacteria, viruses and fungi -- that interact and have strong antioxidant, anti-viral, anti-bacterial and immune-enhancing properties. They promote general health and maintain your body’s natural defence against viruses, stress and disease.  If you are concerned about the Influenza, Dengue or any other viral disease Dr. Mercola highly recommends trying thulasi instead of the flu drugs or vaccines.   Many broad-minded medical analysts have recommended that Sri Lanka instead of depending so much on western medicine and medications should also give a place to time-tested medical systems such as Ayurveda, Homoeopathy and Acupuncture. Unfortunately western medicine, with the marvels of modern technology has today become a big business with many investors throwing their investments into private hospitals.     "
"Diving deep into the influenza outbreak","2018-05-31 00:00:01							0						 				1440","After the Dengue fiasco last year, the Seasonal Influenza Virus has taken centre stage as the most recent health scare. The disease is said to be spread mostly in the southern region of the country, claiming several lives including those of several young children. With not much information available on the present status of the disease, speculation is high, blowing the situation out of proportion. The Daily Mirror spoke to several individuals who are directly involved in dealing with the situation at different levels, clearing the air about these speculations and obtaining information on how to prevent the further spread of the disease. Health authorities are making a rough assumption that the disease came with the touristsHospitals and ICU’s overflowing with patients It’s reported that there have been 19 deaths so far of small children due to fever during the last 28 days, and 12 deaths from pneumonia in the Matara District General Hospital alone. Inside sources claim that the hospitals in Matara District are overflowing with patients having fever, and the bulk of the patients are being cared for at the Matara District General Hospital, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Kamburupitiya Hospital, Walasmulla Hospital, Tangalle hospital, Balapitiya Hospital and Elpitiya Hospital.   ICUs in the district are overflowing with patients having fever and this includes the ICU’s in the hospitals in private sector as well, according to the sources. Out of the 4 people deceased, on the 28 May at the Matara Hospital, 3 are due to respiratory causes. Three people including a 21-year-old youth have passed away due to pneumonia on 28 alone, at the Matara General Hospital.   On inquiring about the disease control measures taken it was initially reported that the schools of 8 divisions in Matara as well as all the pre-schools will be closed until June 1. Two epidemiology teams have been dispatched to the area to investigate the outbreak, according to the sources from the Health Ministry. Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal De Silva has requested an urgent report on the outbreak from the Regional Director of Health Services.   Daily admissions to the hospital for other disease conditions have drastically reduced. Patients don’t show up at the clinics nor do they present themselves for routine pre-scheduled surgery out of fear for the disease outbreak” he revealedThe silence maintained by the Government and the health ministry regarding this matter has become a source of frustration to the general public. The difficulty in obtaining correct information regarding the disease and the number of affected people has driven undue fear and panic into the residents. “All major surgeries in Karapitiya Teaching Hospital have been suspended due to the fever situation”Dr. Janath Liyanage GMOA Branch President at the Karapitiya Hospital“ Almost all our ICU beds are currently being occupied by patients having fever,” stated Dr. Janath Liyanage, Consultant Paediatric Surgeon and GMOA Branch President at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital (KTH) when asked to reveal the current situation at the hospital. Explaining further, he claimed that the ICU has been full for about two months now. All the major surgeries have been suspended until further notice, because the hospital cannot supply the required aftercare in the ICU for the patients undergoing these surgeries due to the ICU being overcrowded with patients having fever. “As a paediatric surgeon, I haven’t been able to do any major surgery for the past 2 months because of the unavailability of the ICU’s”, proclaimed Dr. Liyanage.   As for the overall situation in the southern province, he stated that even the doctors weren’t aware of the exact situation, due to the patients being sent to hospitals throughout the province.   “Not educating the public about the disease adequately has resulted in causing panic among the general population and there is the assumption that a deadly unknown germ is spreading in the Southern Province. Daily admissions to the hospital for other disease conditions have drastically reduced. Patients don’t show up at the clinics nor do they present themselves for routine pre-scheduled surgery out of fear for the disease outbreak” he revealed.   When inquiring into the source of the disease and the strain of the virus he explained that the influenza epidemic commenced last November in US, causing almost 4000 deaths. “In Sri Lanka, as far as we know, the disease started somewhere around Weligama area, so we can make a rough assumption that it came with the tourists,” he said.   “Like the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009 worldwide, it’s currently the influenza strain called H3N2 that is going around, though in a much smaller level, according to international data. So we are assuming that it’s the same strain that we are currently experiencing”, stated Dr. Liyanage.   He emphasized that up to now, the Epidemiology Unit in Sri Lanka has failed to release any information on the virus strain or the specification of treatment to the healthcare workers. “Usually, an infectious disease like this is treated according to a national guideline prepared and released by the Epidemiology Unit. When we requested for an updated guideline they asked us to follow the guideline which was released in 2015”, he said.   “GMOA is having a meeting with the minister to talk about expanding the ICU facilities. We have only 7 ICU beds, even though we have the space adequate for 6 more beds. We requested for the instruments last year, but so far they have not been given. So we are trying to add at least two or three additional beds and equipment to the ICU, to keep the hospital at a functional level,”he said.  Dr. Liyanage also stressed that the secondary infections are more dangerous than the Influenza itself. Most of the children presenting with fever, cough and cold improve within 3 to 4 days. Even though other symptoms disappear the cough can persist. They may again develop high fever with respiratory difficulties and cough, due to another germ that entered the system, due to the weakened tissues from influenza. These infections can be dangerous, causing respiratory failure and sometimes even death.“Influenza not only limited to Southern Province”Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama Infectious Diseases Hospital, Angoda When asked if there is a risk of the virus spreading to the other regions, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, Consultant Physician at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Angoda revealed that contrary to the popular belief, the disease currently persists in other areas of the country, though at a lesser level. He stated that the IDH has been receiving influenza patients for the past 1 1/2 months, currently having around 5-6 admissions of suspected influenza patients per day.” The condition of the majority of these patients is not in serious and they are treated outside,” he further claimed.   When inquiring into the specific strain of the virus he explained that the samples have been sent abroad to be analyzed. This is because Sri Lanka doesn’t have the facilities to analyze the virus and it might take some time for the results to arrive. “The strain of the virus isn’t important in treating the disease, because the treatment methods are similar between the strains of influenza”, he reassured.   The Daily Mirror further learned from him that the vaccine for influenza is recommended to a limited number of people who exposed to risk, even in countries like UK; where they experience yearly outbreaks of influenza virus. These groups ‘at risk’ include youngsters, the elderly, those who are suffering from chronic illnesses and healthcare workers. Therefore the vaccine isn’t required for each and every person and is better to be taken if recommended by a medical profession, he advised.    The vaccine, which is currently available only in the private sector, is not hundred percent effective due to the rapidly changing nature of the virus, he further claimed.   Department of Health and Department of Education along with private and public media organizations have a big role to play in preventing the spread of influenza, stressed Dr. Wijewckrama.    Patients don’t show up at the clinics nor do they present themselves for routine pre-scheduled surgery out of fear for the disease outbreakWhen asked if there is a change in the severity of the disease compared to the previous years, Dr. Wijewickrama claimed that he didn’t observe a drastic change as such, since there were similar incidences of severe influenza during the past couple of years, resulting in pneumonia and sometimes causing deaths of people in vulnerable groups.   The cause for the deaths associated with Influenza is mostly due to the delay in seeking medical care, he commented, explaining that sometimes patients wait until they have severe illness and respiratory difficulty to seek medical help. He added that sometimes the primary care doctors themselves fail to recognize that the patient needs hospitalized care. Dr. Wijewickrama also underscored that the main cause for the high morbidity in most patients with Influenza isn’t the influenza virus itself, but the secondary infections caused by bacteria. Most of this bacteria, which becomes deadly does not respond to antibiotics and it all relates again due to the ignorance of the patients, he declared. “Whenever a person develops a cough and cold, and even if it’s a viral illness, patients expect antibiotics to be prescribed. They demand antibiotics from the doctor or sometimes self-medicate themselves after obtaining medicine from pharmacies. Even some doctors are responsible for prescribing antibiotics inappropriately. So with the frequent use of antibiotics, the body becomes resistant to them and curing these bacterial infections becomes very difficult”, explained Dr. Wijewickrama, who strictly advised patients and the doctors not to use antibiotics unless the disease is of bacterial origin.   Numerous attempts made by the Daily Mirror to contact the Epidemiology unit to obtain the confirmed statistics and information on the disease spread proved futile.  Prevention and seeking medical attentionDr. Ganganath Gunathilake Consultant in Paediatric Respirtory MedicineAccording to Dr. Ganganath Gunathilake, Consultant in Paediatric Respirtory Medicine, educating people regarding prevention is crucial in minimizing the spread of the disease. Being aware and maintaining a good respiratory hygiene can go a long way towards controlling the spread of the disease.   Influenza is highly infectious within the first 7 days after symptoms develop. In preventing the spread of droplets, it’s important to remember that a cough can carry droplets a distance of roughly three feet. Therefore, if you are having symptoms like cough, fever and runny nose then it is important to wear a face mask and avoid public places where you can spread the disease to others. Small children having flu symptoms should be kept at home until the symptoms subside.   All those who come in contact with the virus do not develop symptoms, explained the doctor. The majority would have no symptoms at all while the others would develop symptom ranging from a mild disease to pneumonia. Those who are at the extremes of age, Children under 2 years of age and elderly over 65 years of age, are more likely to develop a  severe illness. Among these children, those having chronic diseases or diseases in organs like the heart or the kidneys are more susceptible. Pregnant women as well as adults, who are suffering from chronic illnesses and having weakened immune systems, are also more vulnerable. If a person belongs to the above categories, it’s important to seek medical attention as soon as the symptoms appear, cautioned Dr. Gunathilake. Patients who are having high fever or respiratory difficulty at any stage of the disease need to seek urgent medical care, he advised.   Whenever a person develops a cough and cold, and even if it’s a viral illness, patients expect antibiotics to be prescribed. They demand antibiotics from the doctor or sometimes self-medicate themselves after obtaining medicine from pharmacies.Patients who are having mild symptoms can usually be safely managed at home with adequate hydration bed rest and paracetamol being given for the fever, said the doctor.   “Secondary Infections cause more harm than influenza”The majority of those who are aware and taking precautions against influenza believe that it’s the primary disease or the influenza that causes severe illness and death in patients. This is not so, according to the many specialists that the Daily Mirror consulted. All of them agree that while influenza can sometimes cause pneumonia and other severe disease, it’s usually the secondary bacterial infections that arrive after developing pneumonia which causes more harm to the patients.   “Damage caused to the respiratory tract by the influenza virus makes it easier for the other bacteria to enter and cause infections, explained Dr. Gunathilake, further stating that these can be more difficult to manage than the virus itself. Therefore he cautioned patients to be on the lookout for secondary infections after a viral infection of the respiratory tract. “These infections usually appear as fever reappearing 4/5 days after subsiding of other symptoms”, he commented.   ‘‘Lack of guidance on how to address the present situation’’D. D. K. Wickra,chchi Matara Divisional Secretary When inquired into the initiatives taken by the Government to address the current health problem in the country, Matara Divisional Secretary D. D. K. Wickramaarachchi said that the Government had taken measures to close the primary schools with the onset of the viral flu. These schools were scheduled to be reopened yesterday (May 30). According to Wickramaarachchi, classroom sessions were conducted as usual for students in other grades although a significant drop was witnessed in the number of students who were present. “Plying along the Pasgoda, Kotapola and Kamburupitiya roads, I noticed that there were only around four to five students in school vans that can usually accommodate around twenty. These were students who were returning  home from school and the number was very low compared to the number of students one may observe in a school van on a regular day.   There is a general fear in sending children to school under the prevailing situation. It has reached a point where the Karapitiya Hospital is no longer receiving additional child patients to the children’s ward in the hospital. My personal view on the matter is that it’s better to close the schools at least until the health authorities issue an official announcement, stating that the prevailing disease situation has been brought under control in the country. To my knowledge, I believe that the Ministry of Health has still not made any official statement regarding the disease. However, it should be noted that even in Matara, there is a general fear that the disease might spread. Currently we are facing a problem due to the lack of proper guidance on how to address the present situation” Wickramaarachchi said.   “The Ministry’s silence is causing undue panic among the citizens”  Stating that there are five main hospitals in the south comprising the main hospitals of Karapitiya Teaching Hospital in Galle, the Teaching Hospital in Maha Modara, General Hospital in Matara, Labima Hospital in Kotawila and the District General Hospital in Hambanthota, Wickramaarachchi continued that statistically, it is difficult to assume how many patients with the virus have been admitted to these hospitals. “Also, it is certainly not within my purview or knowledge to statistically determine the number of patients currently admitted to the hospitals for treatment. Nevertheless, children have been advised to wear a mask to avoid contracting the disease. But, it’s equally important to ensure that these masks are worn by them in the correct manner to avoid the spread of the disease. On the other hand, there is speculation that the influenza disease might spread again in the months of July and August although this needs to be verified since the information is coming from unofficial sources. Also, given that this is the rainy season, now there prevails a risk of dengue spreading in the locality. As a country, we have not impressed enough weight on this matter despite it being a burning social issue that needs to be addressed immediately” he concluded.   "
"Sri Lanka’s critical care speciality  not evolving","2018-05-25 02:37:55							0						 				2104"," Medical specialities evolve for the benefit of patients. It resolves the demand and enhances clinical effectiveness.We are duty bound to support this evolution and create specialist services to serve the need.Quality healthcare is based on this concept and it is patient-centred, not provider centric. Accordingly, doctor training pathways need modification with relevant competencies to produce specialists with matching new skills.Such doctors are traditionally board certified as specialists via an ‘exit’ examination (MD) to achieve a minimum national standard or benchmark. Today, board certification of critical care specialists in Sri Lanka has no ‘exit’ examination, but is primarily testimonials based. This needs urgent redress.   The impetus for the formation of a specialty board for critical care medicine in 2008 under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses of the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) was the plight of junior medical officers serving in intensive care units. The aim was to develop critical care medicine training with multi-disciplinary professional input. After much thought and discussion, a diploma critical care medicine curriculum (DCCM) was installed in 2009 based on the CoBaTrICE model (An International Competency Based Training programme in Intensive Care Medicine for Europe and other world regions) as a stepping stone for a higher degree in Critical Care i.e. MD. The DCCM training programme was of high intensity (60 credits) and matched level 10 of Sri Lanka Quality Framework (SLQF). A world renowned critical care specialist was present as an examiner.   A ‘standard’ and an ‘alternate’ pathway for the transition period were proposed in 2011. This ‘alternate’ pathway allowed anaesthetists practising critical care medicine to continue to do so and enter a trainee tailored training programme until the country produced a sufficient number of MD qualified critical care specialists via the ‘standard’ pathway. This model was approved by the Senate of the University of Colombo. The purpose was to create an independent ‘standard’ training programme for Critical Care Medicine and phase out the ‘alternate’ pathway by 2016.   In 2011, the College of Anesthesiologists took over the reins of this training programme virtually by force and the Board of Study in Anaesthesiology (BOS-A) saw its responsibilities being sanctioned for 1 year by the PGIM in the first instance. But they continued regardless. Sadly, for the past 8 years, no action has been taken to promote the ‘standard pathway’ of training. The above diplomats were neither given an opportunity to take up appropriate leadership roles to shape up critical care services in Sri Lanka nor was a window opened for them for further training for MD. As a direct consequence, many of the diplomats migrated and became consultant critical care specialists elsewhere. The exodus was inevitable. The PGIM failed in its duties to the trainees and public alike.   Scrapping of diploma programmeInstead of promoting this training program, the College of Anaesthetists decided to do away with the diploma programme by demoting its value and removed its foreign examiner. It decided to hold onto the ‘alternate’ pathway of training as the final destination to critical care specialisation. Repeated requests by the Ministry of Health to install the ‘standard’ training pathway fell on deaf ears. The Ministry of Health, the biggest employer of doctors in Sri Lanka, desperately wanted the above diplomats with intermediate training in Critical Care to maintain a credible intensive care service in its hospitals.The lack of recognition of the problem and the inability to rectify the issues raised make the current specialty board in critical care medicine, hosted within the BOS-A, not fit for its purpose. If no action is taken, the DCCM would have no trainee applicants and specialty development of Critical Care Medicine in Sri Lanka will see a natural demise. In order to conceal this diverse interest, dual board certification in critical care medicine was offered to anesthetists. This self-served privilege was proposed, scrutinised and approved by the same board of study (BOS-A) constituted of only anesthetists. No ‘exit’ examination on critical care medicine was necessary.   In the PGIM, competence-based training pathways exist similar to DCCM. Ironically, anesthesia is one of them. In its training, the BOS-Ahas hosted a Part 1 A (a clinical practice-based examination) at the end of the 1st year of training followed by a Part 1 B, a theory test and the final Part 2 MD as its exit examination for decades. Thus,BOS-Ais fully aware of the need of basic clinical competence training for the junior members practicing anesthesia, but denies the same for critical care. Modern critical care is not a speciality that can be remotely managed from home or whilst engaged in another job in the operating theatre. The patient outcomes in critical care heavily depends on the presence of highly trained doctors and nurses on-site (24/7) and capable of recognising and rectifying deteriorating trends and mishaps long before irreversible damage is done.   PGIM and evolving needs Both critical care medicine and emergency medicine were recommended to be accepted as separate specialities in Sri Lanka by the then Minister of Health, the current President Maithripala Sirisena in 2011 following a review of its timely need. The University of Colombo hosts the only Institute of Post Graduate medical training in this country. Therefore, as a public funded organisation, the PGIM is obliged to shape up its training programs to serve the evolving needs of the Ministry of Health that serves all citizens of Sri Lanka.   Every clinical specialty encounters disease conditions that would need intensive care. Therefore, every clinician has a right to participate in the care of their patients, in a critically ill state, to resolve therapies of the original illness. A majority of patients needing critical care services have coexisting medical and surgical problems. Thus, multi-disciplinary inputs are essential to direct training until critical care specialists are produced.   Medicine evolves with time. When Hippocrates initiated medicine as a profession, there were no specialities. Specialities evolved to enhance care for patients and improve outcomes. Thus, the sole purpose of generation of specialities is natural, initially born as a sub-specialty of a parent specialty and then raised to become independent with time with greater experience in its development. For example, there were no paediatricians in 1970’s, but they evolved from adult physicians. In 1990s it was clear that paediatricians could not offer the best services for neonates and hence neonatologists emerged. Although paediatricians were nurtured initially by the College of Physicians, they claim no ownership of paediatrics as a sub-specialty. A similar pathway of development will have to be followed for critical care medicine.   The evolution of critical care medicine in the world began with the concentration of essential equipment and staff in one place of the hospital to serve the most sick patients; a concept first initiated by Florence Nightingale in 1850’s. In 1950’s with a polio epidemic in Denmark, mechanical ventilation was instituted and quite rightly anesthetists had a major role to play. However, with evolution of medicine it became clear that critical care needs new skills to improve the outcome of patients.   The historical contribution by the College of Anaesthetists for the development of critical care medicine should be celebrated, as well as their continued involvement to produce trained future specialists in critical care. This is because some transferable skills of anaesthesia are needed for critical care specialist training. Critical Care specialists encompass other skills and competencies including the ability to lead a team of multi-professional doctors for the benefit of critically ill patients. Multi-organ failure resulting from dengue is one such example. Several recent media reports involving VIPs allude to the consequences of lack of team work.   The very fact that the Sri Lanka College of Anaesthesiologists denial of  the need for multi-professional input to critical care medicine development is testimony to its intentions to delay its progress to become an independent specialty in this country, but why? It is also unfair that a junior doctor is expected to complete his training in anaesthetics as enforced by the BOS-A to be able to commence training in critical care. This is not dissimilar from demanding compulsory training to be a ‘cricketer’ before becoming eligible to be a trainee ‘rugby player’ just because cricketers’ training pathway had a transferable skill such as running.   DCCM Examination It is also surprising that PGIM has allowed board certification of a ‘specialty’ for such a long time with no ‘exit’ examination in its training pathway. The only credible critical care specialty-based examination held by the PGIM to date is the DCCM which is more comprehensive and detailed than any contained in anaesthesia prospectuses. In fact, the diploma holders have undergone the exact duration of critical care medicine training to that of post MD anaesthesia trainees who have become eligible for board certification in critical care without a single ‘exit’ examination in critical care medicine.   Critical Care Medicine already has established sub-specialities in cardiac, neuro, paediatric, renal and liver care in developed countries, and is usually primary disease oriented, and maintains inputs from primary referring specialists. A critical care specialist predominantly focuses on establishing (resuscitation) and maintaining adequate vital organ function by means of pharmacological, physiological, or artificial manipulation or replacement therapy. The primary aim of such stabilisation and maintenance of vital functions is to borrow time in life for natural healing process to take place assisted by the specific therapies instituted by relevant specialists until sustainable organ function has returned naturally or via artificial support of organs or following transplantation.   In the UK, for example, intensive care medicine (ICM), now termed critical care medicine, achieved specialty status in 1999. In the early 1990’s the foundation of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine was by seven parent colleges. This new faculty wasn’t a destination, but was a starting point to establish Critical Care Medicine as a separate specialty. In 1992, the Royal Colleges in the UK formed the Joint Advisory Committee for Intensive Therapy and this became the Intercollegiate Board for Training in ICM in 1996. This was very similar to the establishment of a Specialty Board in Critical Care Medicine under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses in 2008 in Sri Lanka, but sadly moved away for sole management by BOS-A in 2011. This has effectively denounced the need for development of a multidisciplinary professional identity in critical care training in Sri Lanka.   In January 2011, the General Medical Council (GMC) required Faculty of ICM-UK to develop a primary specialty training programme for ICM, a fact that the Sri Lankan College of Anaesthesiologists ignore to be in existence. Instead, the Sri Lanka College of Anaesthesiologists renamed themselves to include intensive care in 2014 without committing to the essential pillars needed for critical care medicine development. In contrast to the GMC, the Sri Lanka Medical Council remains silent.   I hope wisdom will prevail in this ongoing saga. It’s our responsibility to ensure that a safe, effective, efficient, well-led service is delivered to the public through the maintenance of the highest standards of training. Specialty formation should be to achieve the above for patients and not to retain territorial boundaries for provider gain. Moving the Speciality Board for Critical Care Medicine to be hosted under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses shall mark a new beginning. (The writer is a Professor of Anaesthesiology (2002-2013) from the University of Peradeniya and can be reached via E mail cgoonase@sltnet.lk)Acknowledgement: Mahes Salgado for manuscript assistance.   "
"Sugar puts Tea industry in a dilemma","2018-05-23 00:00:47							0						 				5636","''WE WANTED TO CONDUCT THIS TEST SECRETLY"" It was last February that the story of 53 tea factories, which allegedly adulterate tea with sugar during production, was revealed. The raids on these tea factories had been carried out by the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB). The Minister of Plantation Industries of Sri Lanka Navin Dissanayake said that any culprits found guilty would be punished severely. This was revealed through ‘Sathya Gaveshana’ ( Exploration into the truth) an expos article which appeared in our sister newspaper ..Lankadeepa. But, the SLTB has to now check whether it adhered to the proper procedures when doing its research. When it comes to regulations relevant to the tea industry, why does the SLTB, being the legal authority, become so powerless? This week’s exploration is about the much talked about story in the tea industry. This investigation, that was done under the leadership of the former SLTB Chairman Rohan Pethiyagoda, is the first of its kind in the history of Sri Lanka tea. However, he retired from service one month after this investigation; termed as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The position he vacated was filled by Lusil Wijewardena, no stranger to the tea industry. He was entrusted with the task of taking action against the allegations levelled against the 53 tea factories. But there emerged another problem because the alleged factory owners’ stand was that they aren’t guilty.Minister Dissanayake said no quick decisions could be made and it would take about three months before arriving at a conclusionThey have taken steps to challenge the investigation, said to have been done in keeping with a pure scientific method. The minister in charge later afforded an opportunity to the factory owners to express their views. Accordingly, the minister had a discussion on March 29 with the these tea factory owners and the officers of the SLTB. As a result, these factory owners got the opportunity to express their views in writing. But the SLTB encountered an unexpected situation; they had to verify the outcome of the investigation they had already carried out.   In the meantime Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti made a written request to Minister Dissanayake to publish the relevant list of factory owners alleged to have adulterated the tea during manufacturing. His request was to reveal at least the names of 27 factory owners among the 80 factories who have produced tea by reasonable means. When inquired by journalists, a senior officer of the SLTB said that it was not possible to reveal the names of those concerned because no final decision had been arrived at thus far.   However, Pethiyagoda, who was in the forefront of this investigation, is no more with the SLTB. The tea board does not seem to be interested in the relevant research methodology as well. When journalists made inquiries in this regard, Minister Dissanayake said no quick decisions could be made and it would take about three months before arriving at a conclusion. This scenario highlights a negative aspect associated with the tea board. The SLTB has a research institute as well and should be in a position to take responsibility with whatever activities it carries out. The counter allegations made by these factory owners have been aimed at distorting the truth. If this is how the SLTB takes responsibility it’s no shock to see that ‘Ceylon tea’ has become a subject of controversy.   When it comes to the tea industry there are many processes which are connected to it. For instance a number of activities such as tea production, export, brokerage, import and packing are involved in the tea industry. In the event of stemming a defect associated with any process, it is inevitable that the entire tea industry will be affected adversely. Given the present crisis it seems that contributions have been made by the tea plucker to the labourer to intensify the problem in the tea industry. The Tea Small Holders’ Association claims that it is dumped in a chaotic situation when there is a tug-of-war between the SLTB and the tea factory owners. According to them, the main reason for this competition in the market is that despite there being an increase in the number of tea factories it has not been in proportion with the production which has remained low. In reality it is the tea small holders who are in danger because they have to see to the welfare of 2 million dependents. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the authorities to take note of their grievances.   There are various differences of opinion among the business community and the groups who are connected to this industry. These differences were highlighted in the media. However much of these differences are associated with wrong opinions, which have led to arguments. The best example for this is the tea board of neighbouring India. The Tea Board of India (TBI) acts as a facilitator to help people identify real tea from the tea that has been adulterated with colouring. In this aspect the TBI adheres to a rigid policy. Various strategies have been introduced to identify the real products. These strategies not only help the consumer to avoid buying bogus products but also assists the authorities to nab the culprits. They publish newspaper advertisements in this regard. India in comparison to Sri Lanka reveals the truth about the team that’s produced in her country. India makes it a point to make it known to consumers that the future of a tea brand depends solely on honesty and trustworthiness.   It was last year that the tea industry in Sri Lanka celebrated its 150th Anniversary. But, the negative news about the defects in the island’s tea has spoiled the anniversary celebrations. Sri Lanka should not forget that it is facing a challenging situation when other players in the tea market like Kenya and India are doing well. Sri Lankan tea is bought by countries like Russia, Iraq and Iran. It is not very healthy for the SLTB to take such an irresponsible stand because there are so many dependents. It should reveal the truth about the wrong doing of the factory or otherwise accept defeat. If this isn’t done it is the ‘Ceylon Tea’ brand name that’ll suffer because as of now the country’s tea is termed ‘impure’. This is a time when the entire tea industry must remember that old Sinhalese saying, ‘an act of washing clothes and dipping them again in muddy waters’.   ‘Cultivators are in trouble’ - Kularatna Association of All Ceylon Tea Development Small Tea Estates Alliance   Chairman K.L. Kularatna said that tea is presented to the world saying it’s ‘Pure Ceylon Tea’.  “It will damage to the reputation of tea. This is an industry which paves the way to earn the living of 2 million people. There may be only six hundred factory owners. They are engaged in unnecessary competition to earn profits. Now they have a harvest of about three to four hundred kilos from each acre.This is not sufficient. Factories are increased while the production of tea is going down. Then the tender leaves are not sufficient to meet the capacity of the factory. Then they make various methods to increase production. Small tea owners are doing this for their living. We are in trouble due to the work of this small group. Most of the investors are local people who have invested more money on this tea industry.Tea factory owners can change this business, but we can’t do it. We are experiencing  a major crisis. “We wanted to conduct this test secretly”    The following are excerpts of an interview done with the former Chairman of Sri Lanka Tea Board Rohan Pethiyagoda.   Q What sort of test was conducted by SLTB in connection with blending tea with sugar?   The issue of tea being mixed with sugar has been prevalent for sometime. I thought of a new method to verify the truth of this charge in a quick way without waiting for the processing of the black tea. Various properties of sugar are subject to several chemical changes during heating. Any difference detected in the tea leaves during the process of drying, after grinding, proves that the tea has been mixed with sugar. But some were of the view that this test could be done only with black tea and it didn’t surface in the mind of anyone that this test could be easily done at the factory premises. When tea leaves are put in water before they are put in the oven at the factory, the tea begins to dilute and will taste sweet, if sugar has been added. This is a simple and easy method of testing whether there is sugar in tea.   Q But the alleged factory owners maintain that sugar, to a certain degree, is an inherent property of tea itself. How do you explain this view?   It’s true that sugar is naturally found in tea leaves and also in other kinds of leaves. But this sugar is present in fructose form and includes glucose and sucrose. This is less than one percent of the sugar which is produced by the leaf itself. However there is no possibility of increasing this minute degree of sugar during the drying and grinding stages.   We deployed them in groups of two according to the list of factories. Instructions were given to take samples and transport them in cabs while keeping the mobile phones off. What was happening was not known to them - Rohan PethiyagodaQ There is another allegation that this test has been conducted without the direct involvement of SLTB.Your comments.   We wanted to conduct this test secretly. We didn’t even use the SLTB’s vehicles as drivers would come to know about our task. This would have made the factory staff take every precaution to stop their misconducts. I made arrangements to bring the relevant officers to the auditorium of the Tea Research Institute in Kottawa, Galle by inviting them to a so-called farewell party on my retirement from the SLTB.   We deployed them in groups of two according to the list of factories. Instructions were given to take samples and transport them in cabs while keeping the mobile phones off. What was happening was not known to them.   If they had known about our purpose their abuses in the processing of tea would not have been detected.   Q  Why is sugar added in the processing of tea?   Ferrous sulfate, potassium permanganate, sodium hydroxide and sugar are added to give a black colour to the tea. Black tea is expensive and Arabian countries prefer this type of tea. Normally processed tea is grayish in colour. The other thing is that sugar helps in the process of fine grinding. The third factor is the weight. A kilo of sugar costs only Rs.100 while a kilo of tea is Rs 600-700.   Q Some accept that they mix sugar with tea and also argue that there is no harm in this blending process.   A scientist at the Tea Research Institute (TRI) in 1971 prescribed as acceptable a small amount of sugar to be mixed with the tea. This was included in a research paper. However some factory owners have taken it as a recommendation of the TRI. There are easy and profitable ways of manufacturing tea. But it should comply with the legal requirements.We assure the quality of our tea when dealing with the international market. If the real sate of our tea is revealed it will badly affect the produce from Sri Lanka. Other main exporters like India and Kenya follow strict procedures in the operating of their tea industries.   The mixed tea tends to develop a certain fungus three months after the tea auctions and becomes unsalable. These factory owners should realise that they are causing a bad global impression when they do this to our tea.   Q TRI is preparing to do a review of this particular test. Do you agree to such a review?   For our tests we brought down samples of withered tea leaves and leaves of the later stages to Colombo. These samples were brought by the tea inspectors employed under the Commissioner of Tea. They were sealed and signed samples and were also given to the factory owners to avoid any possible disputes.Therefore the allegation of blending tea in Colombo is not true. There was transparency when these tests were done. If there is any suspicion a sample could be retested. Private Tea Factory Owners’ Association behind issue   Following are excerpts of an interview done with a factory owner who is shrouded in allegations.Q What happened really?   That is the general methodology used by SLTB. We are harassed first and then slapped with a fine of Rs.50,000 or 100,000. The factory owners pay the fine because they can’t bear the oppression. The SLTB is an institution where bureaucracy reigns supreme. The main question is whether they have done this to stop the malpractices in the tea industry or whether their aim is to be in the good books of the Minister. Even the officers of the SLTB aren’t aware of this methodology. Opinion is divided within the SLTB itself.   Q  But, hasn’t it been proved that tea is adulterated with sugar?   The sugar level in the tea may fluctuate due to the climate, fertilizer and manner in which tea leaves are plucked. It is practically difficult to prepare a baseline. On the other hand, the chemical composition in tea differs from the places where the leaves are plucked. Tea leaves are put into the dryer after 2 hours of withering and rolling. No recent study has been done in this regard. The SLTB proved that the glucose content is more in the rolled leaf than in the withered one. These claims aren’t scientific because the carbohydrate content increases as soon as the leaf is put in the roller. The HPLC methodology is only a reading.   The SLTB should get involved in this and find out what’s happening. There is a big problem of labour in Sri Lanka - A factory ownerQ  More or less, sugar in the tea may appear as fructose and glucose whereas there may be a slight presence of sucrose. Do you support the argument that there is no reason to increase the natural sugar content while drying and grinding tea leaf?   That is wrong. There is ample evidence of research to prove it. This person who is making this claim has no knowledge about botany. If that is so, this person should do a research and prove it. Really, the former chairman wanted to show that he is a big shot.   Q  Do you accept the suggestion that the sealed tea sample test can dispel doubts?   That is useless. For instance the average value of blood samples should be known to see whether there is dengue. Comparisons are done like that. Here, there is no average value to be compared. What are here are his dimensions. That is not a definition.   Q Are there people who adulterate tea with sugar?   Yes. We have to find out why do they do so? The quality of the Sri Lanka tea is gradually declining. The SLTB should get involved in this and find out what’s happening. There is a big problem of labour in Sri Lanka. The people in the past plucked tea leaf every five days. Later these figures changed from seven to ten days. If mature leaf is adulterated with sugar then it will become wet. When we get 25 kgs. of plucked tea leaves by paying 6 dollars, the countries like Kenya pay 1 dollar and get 60 kgs of plucked leaves. It is useless boasting about ‘Ceylon Tea’ without having a means to survive.The SLTB is an institution where bureaucracy reigns supreme. The main question is whether they have done this to stop the malpractices in the tea industry or whether their aim is to be in the good books of the Minister. - A factory ownerQ  Do you say that there is no problem in mixing tea with sugar?   Really, there is no problem. Even though sugar is mixed, it will not remain as we boil the tea in a high temperature. For instance, this is not an act similar to mixing brick dust with chili powder. On the other hand, all types of chemicals are sprayed in the growing process until the tea leaves are brought to the factory after plucking. If there is nothing like that there is no need for the tea board to intervene. It is the ‘Brahman’ caste or the Private Tea Factory Owners’ Association which is behind this. In the chairman’s factory, 15,000 kgs of tea is not produced per month. Their factories are closing down on a daily basis. They who are unable to face the competition and are trying to close the biggest factories in Sri Lanka.   Q  What did you demand from Prime Minister?   To start a scholarly discussion including the tea board and factory owners. We also asked to conduct a research with the Tea Research Institute. Now there are bogus tea plants all over Sri Lanka. The Tea Board must be committed to start genuine tea nurseries. But, they do not address these real problems.  ‘It is baseless to make allegations’ - Ranasinghe  Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association Chairman Harith Ranasinghe said that if sugar is mixed with tea, the weight and color change resulting in extra profits. “Then they can overcome others. Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association is not going behind anyone. The Minister was informed in one voice by the Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association to inquire into this as it is a disgrace to the name of Sri Lanka Tea, if such a things are happening,” he said.  ‘Methodology needs to be examined’ - EdirisingheTea Commissioner E.A.J.K Edirisinghe said that all 53 factories have already submitted reports on the production process of their factories. They are now being studied by the Tea Board. Their main concern is about the methodology applied by the Tea Board in the testing process. Therefore we are now reviewing our testing methodology.     "

"At the end point of  tolerance","2018-05-09 00:00:24							0						 				734","Battered Meethotamulla residents demand their landsThe time was not at all auspicious for residents of Meethotamulla area back in 2017 on April 14th when the entire country was getting ready to welcome the Sinhala and Hindu New year. The garbage mount which covers a vast area collapsed without leaving a trace of property and 31 lives.   The Meethotamulla garbage mount received the attention of authorities in January, 2013 when Meethotamulla Sri Rahula Vidyalaya closed down. From then many protests were staged urging the authorities to halt garbage dumping in the area. At that time around 800 tons of garbage was dumped daily in the area which covers approximately 17 Acres.   The residents pointed out that it was a tragedy which could have been prevented. Under the Supreme Court order SCFR 218/2009 the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) had limited authority to dump garbage. However, contrary to the order, CMC continued to dump garbage in this area.   Despite the many campaigns held with the aim of eradicating dengue none of them was applicable to Meethotamulla. The area was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and there were many residents who contracted dengue. Residents in the area suffering from skin diseases and respiratory issues was common. Irrespective of the number of pleas, protests and the campaigns the authorities turned blind eye to the issue.   The loss of lives in April 2017 was an eye-opener to many. Some lives had to be sacrificed for the authorities to notice the issue and put a stop to the permanent dumping of garbage in Meethotamulla.   A year has passed and there are residents in this area without homes. This is despite promises made to them by the authorities.    Shantha Jayasinghe, a resident who lost his house and vehicle due to the collapse of the garbage mount, said that he was born and bred in the area and that the residents possessed deeds for the land they lived on. “We are not illegal residents despite some of the Media saying so” he said.   He said that an estimate of forty Lakhs was made for the houses, but no estimate had been made so far regarding the value of the land.   Housing in flats   The residents said that they were given Rs. 50,000 per month as a rent for three months. But this payment was halted after August 2017. During this period some of the residents were evacuated as they were living in areas which were identified as danger zones. Also some of the residents were evacuated considering the fact their houses were half or fully damaged. Some even got housing in flats.   They point out that the basis of the valuation is not fair. And they again had to make requests regarding the balance payments.   “We had to go to Divisional Secretariat requesting for the balance of the compensation. Following a few meetings and requests being made, arrangements were made to give us the money due from August 2017,” the residents said.   The garbage mount still stands tall. The monument gives the indication that it is trying to relate a story about a section of the society that has been battered and betrayedKapila Perera, another resident who lost his house, said that there is another sect of residents who didn’t receive compensation. “Yes, we managed to receive compensation, but there are some residents who didn’t receive anything. There are residents who do not have title deeds, but a card instead which was given during the period of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa. But this card is not accepted anywhere nor is any guidance given to those residents,” he complained.    Perera further said that although the media portray that 90% of the issues of the residents were solved this news is far from the reality.   Fighting for what they deserve   “It is indeed sad how some of the media portrayed this whole incident. Some of the people got the idea that the collapse of the garbage mount was a blessing in disguise as some residents got houses in flats. This is not true. We were left only with what we wore at that moment. Since then life has been a constant battle. We have not been given a permanent solution for the housing issue. We have to fight even to get what we deserve,” he said.   The residents said that none of the Members of Parliament who represented the area followed up what had happened after the collapse of the dump. Adding to their woes none of the Non Governmental Organizations approached them to offer help. They live in constant fear as to what would happen next.   “Many promises were made. One of the promises made was to make this a green zone, but nothing has been done even after the lapse of a year. There is no plan for the next step. True, now they do not dump garbage here, but what are they going to do to the mount? It is still there. Sri Rahula Vidyalaya is still closed. Our Children faced not only health issues, but also had to deal with social concerns. Once the school was closed they were given new schools but were looked down by other students,” they said. They said that compared to other similar situations that developed in the country they were not offered any help to uplift their mental status.   “When other disasters struck the country many steps were taken on behalf of the people’s welfare. During past disasters there was also psychological support for those affected. There were children who were to sit for the Grade five Scholarship Examination. This is one opportunity which a child gets to join a school that offers better facilities. After the devastation the children could not perform at the exam in keeping with expectations as they did not have books nor other psychological support. As parents we could not support them as we too were devastated at that time,” they said.    The residents further said that if they aren’t provided with a reasonable solution by the Government the only option they have is to return to the area close to the garbage mount and build houses.“We were born and bred here. All our lives evolved here. If the Government is not going to dump garbage they can clear the area, improve infrastructure and give the lands back to the residents,” the residents said.   Furthermore they said that although a committee had been set up, the only action taken so far was the removing of the Commissioner of the CMC.   “It is not just the Commissioner who should be responsible for this. There were many people who are responsible. What is the use of removing just one official? It does not make any difference to our lives” the residents argued.   The garbage mount still stands tall. The monument gives the indication that it is trying to relate a story about a section of the society that has been battered and betrayed.    When the Daily Mirror contacted Navin Mannapperuma, Director Western Province Waste Management Authority, he said that measures had been taken to make the garbage mount less active. “There are many garbage mounts like these in the world. Although many claim that the garbage here can be recycled, in reality we cannot use the entire mount for that purpose. What can be done is to make it inactive. There is a plan executed by University of Moratuwa along with the Ministry of Megapolis with regard to Meethotamulla,” he said.     "

"March tourist arrivals up 24% despite communal clashes","2018-04-10 00:00:27							0						 				2536"," Despite the communal clashes that unsettled Sri Lanka’s hill country during the first two weeks of March, the tourist arrivals to the island nation in the same month grew 24.1 percent to 233,382, the data released by Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) showed. However, this strong growth comes from a low base last year, due to the partial closure of the country’s main airport in Katunayake.According to the SLTDA, Europe continued to be the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka, accounting for 53 percent of the total arrivals received in March 2018. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 38 percent of the total traffic, America 7 percent, Middle East one percent and Africa one percent.  India, the United Kingdom, Germany, China and France were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist-generating markets during March.  India was the largest source of tourist traffic with 13 percent of the total traffic received in March. The United Kingdom also accounted for 13 percent of the total traffic, while Germany, China and France accounted for 11 percent, 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively.   Tourist arrivals from India during March rose 13 percent year-on-year (YoY) to 30,583, while arrivals from the United Kingdom rose 56.1 percent YoY to 30,366. Visitors from Germany rose 60.6 percent YoY to 24,423, while from France the arrivals rose 29 percent YoY to 14,818.Tourist arrivals from China fell 4.8 percent to 21,101.An analysis of arrivals by regions showed Europe leading the pack with 124,144 tourists during March, recording a growth of 44.5 percent YoY.Arrivals from Asia and the Pacific edged up 2.2 percent YoY to 88,299, while arrivals from the Americas rose 61 percent YoY 16,006.Tourists from Oceania, which includes Australia and New Zealand, rose 58.2 percent YoY to 9,966. Visitors from the Middle East fell 26.6 percent YoY to 3,520, which could be directly attributed to the communal violence prevailed during the early weeks of the month.To tame the violence that erupted between the extremist factions of Sinhala and Muslim communities, the government had to declare a state of emergency and ordered a social media blackout, which lasted almost a week, even after the hostilities ended.  Due to the police curfew that prevailed, the tourists in Kandy were trapped in their hotels and had to use their passports as curfew passes to leave the area. However, there were no reports of any tourist being harmed.   Meanwhile, on a cumulative basis, tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka in the first quarter of 2018 rose 17.1 percent YoY to 707, 924.Sri Lanka achieved 2.1 million tourists in 2017 despite the partial closure of the country’s main airport for about three months. The floods and the dengue epidemic also contributed to the lower than expected arrivals. The government aims to attract three million tourists this year.  "

While walking through the paths of life we come cross many strangers.   “Strangers” is a leadership programme with adventurous games and activities organized by the Marketing Management Association (MMA) of the Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce (FMSC) of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura (USJP). The Strangers is the only Sri Lankan inter-university room organized by a single department.  The Strangers has its origins back to the year 2013. This event is exclusively for the first year students of the FMSC with the prime inception of strengthening friendly bonds among the fresh blood. While enriching their inspiration, motivation and a pinch of creativity and imagination, it provides a useful opportunity where one can learn and experience the fun of competing and team spirit.  Accordingly, with the prime intention of strengthening tomorrow’s leadership by improving mental and physical fitness along with promoting good health and well-being, the programme, ‘Strangers’ assist the participants to be fully equipped with knowledge, skills and attitudes. Strangers commenced its opening ceremony on the 11th of June 2015 at the Kasa Gas Sewana of the USJP, with the participation of students from both local and foreign universities, several Sri Lankan artistes along with the other distinguished guests from the university, and the corporate sector.   Strangers 2013 led off with the inauguration ceremony at the kasa gas sewana of USJP for the fourth time, with a magnificent step forward by opening up the romping adventure game to corporate members. Participants were clustered into ten groups. The adventurous game began and was conducted in Belihuloya and Ella for three days at a stretch, followed by a grand awarding ceremony.  The Strangers is an extraordinary opportunity to build Sri Lankan tourism, and most importantly, ‘Strangers’ engages in various activities. Last year Strangers shouldered a special project regarding Dengue prevention and awareness. This year, Strangers 2018 is  looking forward to launching many more innovative projects.   For further information contact - Vimukthi 0710555809 "

"Rosy Senanayake believes Colombo could be better than Malaysia","2018-03-29 00:00:01							26						 				19069","Colombo’s first female Mayor Rosy Senanayake assumed duties last week and is in the process of ‘setting things right’ at the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). During the run-up to the elections, Senanayake presented an elaborate manifesto addressing various issues in and around Colombo. One of her primary focuses includes developing underserved development areas. “The beauty of Colombo is that it’s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city,” she said in an interview with the Daily Mirror. Excerpts:  	We are contracted to provide 700 metric tonnes of mixed garbage for this project by August 2019	The Govt. has identified Aruwakkalu as a permanent dumping place	The Govt. is in the process of streamlining the property registration process in the CMC	We have a waste-to-energy project which the Municipality has signed with a private entity	Social welfare projects would be concentrated 100% on these underserved development areas  Q  What are the immediate challenges that you have faced and would address in the near future?We have actually looked at a few (challenges), but garbage remains our number one priority. We had a meeting with the Prime Minister last week because we faced a crisis situation since the authorities at Muthurajawela stopped collecting mixed waste. We then had to negotiate with the Minister and within 48 hours we dumped the collection. I also believe that the residents have a responsibility in segregating the garbage. I have informed the Municipality to educate the residents because they cannot haphazardly dispose of garbage. We have a waste-to-energy project which the Municipality has signed with a private entity which would get off the ground by the end of 2019. A meeting was held and this will continue every month to see how far they have progressed. We are contracted to provide 700 metric tonnes of mixed garbage for this project by August 2019. By then I believe that most of our problems would be solved given that this project takes off.   In the past, the Governments had not realized how waste could be a money-spinner. There are many facets and uses of waste. We also have had discussions to improve the health and sanitation sector next. The dengue mosquito and the epidemic normally happen in a cycle of twice every year. So we are getting ready to minimize the effects of breeding grounds. The Government is in the process of streamlining the property registration process in the CMC. The project spearheaded by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade is aimed at enhancing investment climate and paving the way for taxpayers to receive an efficient service at comparatively less cost. For this there are three stakeholders namely the Registrar General’s Office, the CMC and the Survey Department. We just signed the MoU with them. For the time being it’s a manual process and earlier to register the property in Colombo it took more than 30 days. The MoU will enable us to share information among all stakeholders. We are also preparing for Vesak.As Sri Lankans we need to celebrate all festivals. The beauty of Colombo is that it’s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city and we have always lived in harmony no matter what happens in the rest of the country. Hence, we have co-existed and therefore we need to celebrate each one’s cultural background and customs. There will be open houses and the municipality will encourage co-existence among different cultural communities. We are looking at the housing, underserved settlements and their needs etc.   We have already appointed a committee to empower women and look into their needs and bring in multi-serving and multi-purpose community centres Q  The CMC was in the news for several incidents related to bribery and corruption. How would you streamline the activities within the Council? Firstly it is about bringing in e-governance and instilling discipline in the Council. I’m also working on a mechanism to bring everyone to work, hence improving the quality of work. I also need to establish a Human Resource Department because roughly about 9000 people work here and there’s also a need to establish a few departments which are not in existence at the moment. Then we also could look at the social welfare and reward people for the work that they do, give them the incentives to come to work and put the place right. They need to work with the correct frame of mind. If I am to train them on how to think creative and think global and move from where we are then I would do that as well. I strongly believe that Colombo could be better than Singapore or Malaysia. A little bit of effort and leadership is what is needed along with the right mechanism to take this city to heights beyond expectations.   The beauty of Colombo is that it’s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city and we have always lived in harmony no matter what happens in the rest of the country Q  A recent report by a Presidential Commission revealed that the Meethotamulla tragedy was the result of the municipality failing to carry out proper garbage disposal methods. What are your comments? That’s the past and it was beyond my control. I need to study the report and understand the drawbacks. We are looking at the way forward. This is why we had discussions about the waste-to-energy project, consultations with the Megapolis Minister and PM to address the waste issue. In the past, Meethotamulla was a disaster because in order to beautify Colombo, waste was taken and dumped in our neighbour’s garden amidst their protests. These things were done in a haphazard way since the demise of Ranasinghe Premadasa. I don’t think successive Governments had any plans regarding what to do with Colombo’s waste or waste at large around the country.The present Government has identified Aruwakkalu as a permanent dumping place and they are now doing the groundwork. I’m looking at managing and handling Colombo city’s waste from the time I took over. But I would certainly study the report and see where we went wrong. Each ward member will have an App, so the residents of that ward can keep in touch with the member. Therefore ward members could educate their residents and get  them to be more responsible of keeping the city clean. Now that we have 47 wards in the six districts and having 47 ward members, putting in money to those wards to carryout the necessary infrastructure development I’m sure that we would be able to see a stronger and a better Colombo. This is ‘Our Colombo’ as written in my slogan and this city is our responsibility. I’m hoping that the residents would support. My appeal to every member of the Municipality is to support us in our work, irrespective of their parties. Let’s start putting the city first. In the past, the Governments had not realized how waste could be a money-spinner. There are many facets and uses of waste Q  A majority of citizens in Colombo are from underprivileged areas. You have said that the development of these areas will be prioritized. What is your plan? My primary focus even with the 25 multi-purpose community centres is on the underserved areas because 1/3rd of the population lives in those areas. When I spoke about mixed garbage, when people don’t adhere to the norms, they all come from underserved areas. That’s not because they don’t understand or they are not disciplined; it is because they don’t have the provision. A normal house might have space to keep three different bins, but in a watte (A small area where people live), inside a tiny little room with five families I don’t think there’s room to put a bin. Therefore I have been telling the ward members to find a common place in the watte where the municipality can install a garbage disposal system.We need to look at housing, sanitation and water for them. When I spoke about maternity clinics and dispensaries I was addressing the underserved development areas. When it comes to social welfare projects it would be 100% concentrated on these underserved development areas. I had a discussion with a foreign diplomat to establish three vocational training centres and daycare centres because I want to increase the female participation in the labour force. In order to do that I need to develop the infrastructure including affordable day care centres, safe transportation, flexible hours created and so on. We would also be having a daycare for the Municipality. When we improve the lifestyles of people in these areas then major projects such as sewer lines, waste water, drainage and mass scale housing projects will be in our long term development plans.   Each ward member will have an App. Therefore ward members could educate their residents and get  them to be more responsible of keeping the city clean Q  Will future development activities of the city incorporate the ‘wathu’ system or would they be demolished?   It all depends. We still have to consider the availability of land to see the possibility of building houses for them. We have already appointed a committee to empower women and look into their needs and bring in multi-serving and multi-purpose community centres. Most of my plans will be focused on developing underserved development areas.    Q  Many people travel to Colombo daily to engage in work. Those such as tourists visit Colombo for leisure. How would you plan to develop facilities in a way that would benefit those visiting the city?   The residents are approximately 550,000 people whereas about 600,000 migrate on a daily basis. This is why we had a discussion with the Architects’ Association from the Chairman to the secretary who met with the Engineering Department and our architects to find out how to safeguard the cultural heritage. They want to focus on parks and improving services for the migrant citizens coming in on a daily basis because we have some major schools in the country. These include everything from public toilets, resting places, opening up more areas to have recreation facilities for families around the Beira, the Fort area and so on. We are also considering the buildings that have a heritage value and plan to restore and maintain them and give Colombo a new outlook. They were very enthusiastic and this is the groundwork that we would be doing during next three months. We would be able to see some tangible results hopefully.   Firstly it is about bringing in e-governance and instilling discipline in the Council. I’m also working on a mechanism to bring everyone to work Q  Many CMC workers are senior citizens who work day in and day out and receiving minimum wages. Are there plans to increase their salaries and incentives?   That was one of the first questions I asked the department heads when I assumed duties. I want to read those contracts because we outsource many of these work. In those outsourcing contracts there are minimum age and salary scales. I have given all these contracts to my legal team to study them. I have advised the department heads to thoroughly review those contracts and to inform these people to be present at work, to adhere to what is written in the contract or step down. In future when we sign contracts we need to be specific about certain things such as salaries, age etc. This is why I need a HR department established.    Q  In a previous interview you mentioned about establishing rehabilitation centres for the youth. Along with these centres, how would the drug menace be mitigated in future?   That is something that I have promised and would be doing within the next couple of months. I’m waiting for the Council to be formed in order to bring in resolutions to do many other things that are included in my manifesto. That’s a huge menace and it’s not an issue with just one strata of society, but it exists at every level. Much needs to be invested in terms of technical assistance and finances, but we would eventually make it a reality.    Q  During the previous Government most of the beautification projects were carried out under the purview of the Urban Development Authority (UDA). Why didn’t the CMC get involved?   Some of the projects such as housing and infrastructure development with sewer waste etc would be done with the line ministries and the Central Government. The funding will also have to come from the Central Government. But the CMC can handle basic beautification projects. For example the Independence Square belongs to the UDA and we need to consider people who just park their vehicles and leave. I have instructed them to have an authorized parking space. When you have restrictions people can walk to their destination. I’ll also have to work with the Health Ministry and several other ministries in certain projects.     "
"Mobitel takes the lead in helping combating Dengue among school children with the  ‘DengueFreeChild’ app","2018-03-28 10:34:37							0						 				1606","(From Left) Mr. Sunil Hettiarachchchi, Secretary – Ministry of Education, Mr. P. G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena, Chairman – Sri Lanka Telecom & Mobitel and Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Deputy Director General, Public Health Services officially launching the ‘DengueFreeChild’ app.Mobitel, Sri Lanka’s National Mobile Service Provider, launched an innovative mobile app to help combat the spread of Dengue among school children in Sri Lanka at a special event held at the BMICH on 27 March 2018.The ‘DengueFreeChild’ app was developed by Mobitel in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the University of Colombo and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The app enables users to proactively report of Dengue or suspected Dengue fever so that action can be taken to the premises around which the infection is prevalent for mosquito breeding areas as well as to alert other parents to keep a keen eye on Dengue-like symptoms in their own children.Around 30 percent of all Dengue patients who sought treatment in 2017 were children, according to the data collected by the National Dengue Control Unit of the Ministry of Health. “Early diagnosis of Dengue can save a child’s life,” says Dr. Hasitha Tissera, National Coordinator of the National Dengue Control Unit. “We have found that early diagnosis of Dengue and immediate treatment almost always leads to a complete recovery. The need for parents and carers to be alert and aware of the possibility of Dengue symptoms in their children cannot be overstated.”Recent statistics revealed that there are nearly 4.4 million students in more than 10,000 schools across Sri Lanka today. As the Dengue mosquito is reported to be active during the morning hours, students are all at greater risk of being infected if mosquito breeding grounds exist in schools and surrounding areas. The app creates awareness and allows sharing of information quickly that enables parents and school authorities to take preventive action to stop the spread of Dengue. Ministry of Education through Health and Nutrition Division is actively contributing to maintain schools free of dengue breeding sites. Therefore, this new app will help them to monitor the situation more closely.The ‘DengueFreeChild’ app has been created with separate user access for government officials and school authorities, in addition to the general public use of sharing and accessing information about Dengue patients.“Dengue has become a critical national health issue, and as the National Mobile Service Provider, we had a responsibility to find ways to combat this disease,” says Isuru Dissanayake - Senior General Manager Marketing, Mobitel. “We are proud to collaborate with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the University of Colombo and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore to design and develop this timely and much-needed application. It gives us immense satisfaction to leverage on our specialized mobile technology to enhance the wellbeing of the children of our country.” The ‘DengueFreeChild’ app is now available for free download by Android Users on Google Play Store. 						* Dailymirror.lk neither liable nor responsible for any information / contents published in this article"
"‘Flower  buds’  that didn’t bloom  !","2018-03-27 00:00:40							0						 				1065","These are tragic tales of the lives of some innocent parents who were compelled to grin and bear tragedies. These tragedies happened when their kids  breathed their last recently.   For many years, it has been reported that the dengue mosquitoes were active and were sucking the blood of the people from all walks of life. But it is ironic that such tragedies befall on innocent kids. The loss of such kids is felt by their parents forever. It is not only the dengue mosquito, but also the lives of the infants that have been snuffed out in various devilish forms from time to time.   Among those who died recently was a son by the name Shalika Shehan. This child is said to have lived with much hope. Having lived in Kalutara area, he was first educated at Kalutara Maha Vidyalaya and later enrolled at Royal College, Colombo. He showed a keen interest in education and extra-curricular activities. He had just sat for the Advanced Level Examination when this tragedy took place. When the son worshiped his father, who was about to leave home, he might not have thought that it was the last time he would get to worship his dad. Shehan, who died of a sudden heart attack, was also denied of the opportunity to know that he had obtained many distinctions at A/Level Examination. The house where he lived is isolated today.    Among those who died recently was a son by the name Shalika Shehan. This child is said to have lived with much hopeAnother death   Another ‘flower bud’ named Dewindi, who lived under the parents care, had a similar tragedy. She studied in grade 5 in Thri/Padavipura Jayanthi Wewa School. The cartoon ‘hero’ in a TV. Programme, that was shown on the TV, Influenced her to imitate this character and his actions. One such feat that repeated was binding a creeper around her neck. This resulted in the unfortunate death of tiny Dewindi. This is how she said goodbye to life at an unexpected moment.   Small children are like flowers. Their small hearts are warmed with the love and affection they show for fauna and flora. Susith Nirmal who lived in Inuwila in Chilaw also died unexpectedly. He was a resident of Samindugama (an area spanning 40 acres), in Chilaw. He had gone to the jungle with the hope of catching parrots with an unknown person. This person has had the habit of visiting the village to pluck king coconuts. But, he was unable to fulfill his expectations of catching parrots which was child’s hobby. It is said that this boy had been sexually abused, the incident leading to his death. It was after several days that the boy’s remains were found. The remains of the boy were found in a jungle in Inuwila.   Even before the flames of Susith’s funeral pyre died down the death of another child, this time a daughter, was recorded. The name of the deceased was Saheli Niwarthika. She was a grade four student and attended Buddhist Primary school in Dehiowita. She was very humble and obedient to her teachers. The children in her class had to walk on the coconut shells as part of an extra-curricular activity, prescribed in the syllabus. The children in this class were seen practicing this activity earnestly on the gravel-less ground. Therefore, it was a frequent sight for the teachers to see these kids practice.   All of a sudden, small Saheli had collapsed on the ground while trying this exercise. In spite of the fact that Saheli was hospitalized by the teachers concerned, she died unexpectedly.   The daughter, Madubhashini Buddhika Liyanage (16) was another student who faced an untimely tragedy as all others mentioned here. She studied in grade eleven in Udagama Maha Vidyalaya in Atabage in Gampola. She was a resident of Deniyagama area in Millagahamula in Gampola. She was well versed in music.   She played the violin well and was a gifted singer. She also attended dancing classes with her classmates. She had dropped her head saying that she was having a severe headache. Despite being taken to the nearby rural hospital for treatment, her condition had worsened. She was admitted to the Gampola Hospital for further treatment as per the medical instructions, but her life could not be saved.   However, it is clear that these deaths have left a clear message for us. ‘Malnutrition also causes untime deaths’According to Nutritionist, Harshani Meegaswatte, obesity has become an issue, especially among urban children. But, there are also children who suffer from malnutrition despite food being available at homes. Although some mothers give food to their children these diets aren’t balanced. Most children as a result don’t carry the proper weight for their age. The weight of some children are below average. Some children don’t have breakfast. Such children have their first meal during the interval.   She added that it was not only child abuse, but malnutrition that has brought untimely deaths to children. These factors are the causes for their malnutrition, she emphasized.  it was not only child abuse, but malnutrition that has brought untimely deaths to children "
"Lankan formulates mosquito repellent","2018-03-26 00:03:25							0						 				961","Says it addresses all factors that attract mosquitoesTo repel the mosquitoes that spread dengue, filaria and malaria, an engineer has formulated a liquid.“This liquid is pleasant to smell as well as it is safe on the human body.  It will smell for only five minutes but it can repel mosquitoes for 12 to 14 hours,”  Eng.  Rakitha Brito said. “The liquid will not affect children or pregnant women,” he claimed.“I have taken so much of time and energy to do the research and analysed the solution for the problem.  The main cause mosquitoes get attracted to human body is breathing -the release of carbon dioxide and the rate of releasing carbon dioxide is more in pregnant women.’’‘’When exercising there will be more chemical reaction in the human body and it will release lactic acid during the session, so that mosquitoes will be attracted to it according to research.Alcohol also attracts mosquitoes,” he said.  ‘’All over the world, people are still working on a solution to this.  Yet, the sprays aren’t effective and there are many side effects.  Normally we can prevent mosquitoes by preventing dark coloured clothes.We should use yellow lights at home. We also could use Lavender and Maduruthalaa to repel mosquitoes.’’“I wanted to repel mosquitoes instead of killing them. The liquid gives a smell, which is not tolerated  by mosquitoes and functions as a repellent. I hope many people would use this.I also hope it will spread around the world,’’  Brito said. "
"Vehicles of corruption From bicycles to  Benz cars","2018-03-22 00:00:04							0						 				2341","Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe didn’t mince his words when addressing newly elected members to the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). He told them what is expected of them and what is not.‘Save the city dwellers from dengue, resolve the garbage issue and keep the city clean,’ he said. Now if any CMC member or indeed anyone elected to any local government authority had to have responsibilities outlined thus, it is sad.However, Wickremesinghe was just warming up, it seems. He quickly moved to what could also be called known-stuff but stuff that few talk about. Stuff related to corruption.‘Don’t become politicians who search for luxuries after coming to the field as paupers,’ he is quoted as having said.Obviously there are those born with the proverbial silver spoon. They came into politics in a Benz car and still drive around in such vehicles. Well, some have expanded a single Benz into a fleet. Cars are seen, bank accounts are notHe uses an apt analogy: ‘Some politicians own only a push bicycle when they come to politics but later obtain Benz cars. Don’t think of becoming such politicians.’He’s correct. We have seen how politicians grow, literally and metaphorically. The tale has been told and retold by cartoonists across many decades. Cartoonists exaggerate for effect but in this case it’s fair depiction. Wickremesinghe has been spared and for good reason. He’s remained lean throughout his political life.Obviously there are those born with the proverbial silver spoon. They came into politics in a Benz car and still drive around in such vehicles. Well, some have expanded a single Benz into a fleet. Cars are seen, bank accounts are not.In any event, he has articulated a problem. He has not offered a solution, though.If telling people, ‘Aney, please don’t steal’ worked, we wouldn’t need a commission to investigate allegations of bribery and corruption. Indeed, we wouldn’t need courts. Judges and lawyers would be out of work. It just doesn’t work that way and Wickremesinghe probably knows this.Now, we shouldn’t make too much of a cautionary note made by a party leader to greenhorn politicians. We should, on the other hand, talk about the problem which, sadly, neither Wickremesinghe nor his partner-in-governance President Maithripala Sirisena has done little about. Corruption.When Maithripala Sirisena announced that he would contest the presidency, former president Chandrika Kumaratunga said ‘he is the only one in the current regime who is not corrupt.’We don’t know what Sirisena’s first vehicle was nor what he purchased last nor how. Perhaps Wickremesinghe would know. That’s another matter.What we saw immediately after he won the election is Sirisena and Wickremesinghe with the obvious approval of Kumaratunga appointing to cabinet those who in their book were corrupt. That was the beginning and that’s not to say that those in the United National Party were squeaky clean. They most certainly were not!We don’t have to list all the wrongdoings of politicians in the ruling coalition. The term ‘bond scam’ would do. There was scam and there was aiding and abetting. Wickremesinghe and Sirisena both know all about it. The first COPE report was scuttled by dissolving parliament.Arjuna Mahendran’s innocence was claimed, the man was defended. The Attorney-General helped by choosing who to attack; who not to. Those who were clearly under a cloud were bailed out with new positions.Clearly there are lots of loopholes and Wickremesinghe would know about most of them and also those who used these conveniences. Surely, it’s not only those in ‘other parties’ who moved did the bike-to-Benz number?There are no easy plug-all-holes solutions. The institutional arrangement needs to be fixed. The human resources are clearly inadequate, inept and corrupt. Political interference continues to be a problem despite the 19th Amendment. The Ministry of Law and Order is being treated like a hot potato by the Government, with three ministers being in charge of the subject over the last two months.Don’t become politicians who search for luxuries after coming to the field as paupersMore than all this, there’s what could be called a cardinal principle in the matter of sanctioning and encouraging wrongdoing. This is how it goes, as was pointed out editorially in a different newspaper about six years ago: if the boss is corrupt, he/she gives a licence for corruption to everyone under him/her.If any person down the line is corrupt, it means that either the boss is corrupt or inept. Lots of hats there and people are more than welcome to pick them up.If we have come to a point where newly appointed representatives need to be told ‘Please don’t rob’ we are in pretty bad shape. One of the key issues and one which is either ignored or is unknown to the relevant persons is that the primary task of the elected is to represent and the make laws. They are legislators and not executives.However, the moment the pernicious ‘Decentralized Budget’ was introduced (by a previous UNP government), each and every legislator got the opportunity to play executive in his/her electorate and in most cases without any consultation with other entities, political or administrative, authorized to handle development. When you execute at any point, you tend to forget the legislating function.When you have give people the license to cut corners and make bucks, it is silly to expect them to think of push bicycles and not Benz cars.If telling people, ‘Aney, please don’t steal’ worked, we wouldn’t need a commission to investigate allegations of bribery and corruptionTo put it simply, when you take the village out of the hands of the villagers and put it in the pocket of the politician, you are facilitating Benz-dreams. Wickremesinghe is not doing anything of the sort, but he’s doing nothing to put things right.Asset declaration at arrival and departure is a must. A strong audit commission that can resist political interference is a must. Honesty and integrity are musts. It’s sad that we must mention these things to bicycle-to-Benz politicians.Here’s an exercise for the UNP leadership: conduct a quick survey under two broad headings, ‘First vehicle’ and ‘Current vehicle’. What was it, how much did it cost, how did you find the money, why did you choose it as opposed to something else, are the questions that need to be asked. It’s something all party leaders can do, if they have the courage or the moral authority that is.Malinda Seneviratne is a freelance writer. malindasenevi@gmail.com. www.malindawords.blogspot.com"

The membership comprised a group of Sri Lankans - scientists, doctors, engineers, agriculturists, economists and administrators, who had served the United Nations family and other international organizations such as the Commonwealth Secretariat and Regional Banks.  The objectives of the Association were defined as promoting the purposes and activities of organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and other international organizations; fostering friendly relations and intellectual contacts among its members, establishing and maintaining a data-base of former international civil servants from Sri Lanka for the purpose, among others, of identifying and providing appropriate expertise to governmental, non-governmental and international agencies if and when requested. This latter activity is expected to contribute to the social and economic development of the country.   During the tsunami period AFICS rose to great heights. AFICS built a house in Hikkaduwa; carried out mental health projects in eight Grama Seva Niladhari Divisions in Hikkaduwa to reduce mental health concerns and psycho-social disorders among post-tsunami victims; assisted in carrying out a health survey of the community and a rapid assessment of drinking water practices among the target population. AFICS also initiated a scholarship fund to award scholarships to deserving students and assisted two schools in the Hikkaduwa area.   Ably assisted by the Lions Club of Havelock Town, AFICS conducted Medical camps at the Nagaswatte Community Centre in 2016 and 2017 where checking of blood pressure, testing of vision, and examining women for cervical and breast cancer took place and patients were referred to the National Hospital, Kalubowila Teaching Hospital and appropriate Municipal clinics.   AFICS responded to a popular request from the female members of Kirillapone Community for training facility in sewing, which they intended to use for self-employment. A four months’ course was inaugurated for eight members. AFICS submitted a proposal to find partial funding for this project to the Chairman of IDEAS, in addition to the support extended by the community to facilitate it by providing lunch and transport. Thus, this project was collaborated by Singer Company, AFICS and IDEAS. The project is being implemented successfully.   Two members who had served with WHO played a role in the WHO Declaration of Malaria and served on the Dengue Oversight Committee which advises the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka.   The Association also gives due consideration to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals for Sustainable Development, i.e. Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger, Achieve Universal Primary Education, Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women, Reduce Child Mortality, Improve Maternal Health, Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other Diseases, ensure environmental sustainability, Develop a global partnership for development.   "
"MAN’S INHUMANITY TO MAN","2018-03-15 03:54:00							2						 				9421"," HOSPITAL HOAX!!! There is no other country in the world where ‘MAN’S INHUMANITY TO MAN’ is more explicit, more brazenly displayed, than in this BUDDHIST COUNTRY of ours!!!  The first HOAX is the Government promising FREE MEDICINE, FREE HOSPITALIZATION to its citizens.  If that were true, this land would be a paradise indeed. You are admitted FREE, unlike in the schools but God helps you once you get in. It is not the doctors but the nurses and attendants you have to beware of!!!  Apparently, according to their regulations, a patient who is very ill is allowed to keep someone to look after them, but that person has to stay where they are told to stay, not near their patient. When they check on the patient from time to time, they find to their horror that the patient has either vomited or passed urine or, in some cases, is even unconscious without anyone’s knowledge. WHY? WHY, because the caregiver is not anywhere near the patient and does not know what has happened.  BUT WAIT! There is an alternative, for sure, if you pay Rs. 1,500/- a day you can get an attendant from the hospital, an attendant who is never around but appears mysteriously during visiting hours only, to see how much money they can scrounge and also to get a share of whatever fruits or other items that have been brought for the patient.  Most of the time, whatever has been brought is stolen and either sold or taken to their homes.!! A glaring example of man’s inhumanity to man! Can a poor patient who is admitted to a General Hospital out of sheer necessity because they can’t afford to get into any other hospital, can they possibly pay 1,500/- a day for a special attendant???  IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, WHO CHECKS ALL THIS INHUMAN BEHAVIOUR? ARE ANY OF THE AUTHORITIES AWARE OR ARE THEY PART AND PARCEL OF IT? Don’t these VULTURES REALIZE THAT SITUATIONS COULD BE REVERSED IN NO TIME, THAT THEY COULD WELL BE THE PATIENT WHO NEEDS CARE AND THEY WILL HAVE NO ONE TO GIVE IT TO THEM?  That is not the only injustice meted out - the other horror is when it comes to MEDICINE!!! Medicine is prescribed but most often the unsuspecting patients are told that the medicine is not available and they have to get it from outside.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE MEDICINE AT THE HOSPITAL IS SOLD AND THE POOR PATIENTS HAVE TO PAY AN ARM AND A LEG FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD GET FREE!!! WHO LOOKS INTO ALL THIS - WHO CARES ABOUT THE WORRIES AND AGONIES OF THE POOR PATIENTS??? DOES ANYONE CARE???   CANCER HOSPITAL If you think the above is bad, wait till you hear this.  IT IS TRULY HORRENDOUS!!!  Having cancer in itself is horrendous but these inhuman vultures carry on as though they or their people are never going to be struck by cancer or any other terrible disease. After a patient has been operated they are asked to come back to the clinic twice a month to check on their progress.  The Sri Lankan vultures have found a way of cashing in on this also. When you go to the Cancer Hospital clinic you have to wait your turn to see the doctor and the wait is endless, BUT if you place Rs, 200/- in the Record Keeper’s filthy hand, your file miraculously appears at the top of the endless pile of files.  Here again, I ask, what are the authorities doing about this treachery??? The problem of medicine remains the same here as well, irrespective of the fact that these poor patients have a life-threatening illness and desperately need the medicine prescribed.  More often than not they are told the medicine is not available. Amazingly though the medicine IS available at the pharmacy next to the Cancer Hospital!!!  FREE EDUCATION, FREE HEALTH CARE??? - FREE WIFI, OH YES; WE GOT THAT, THE ONLY ONE THAT IS REALLY FREE!!    CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL Surprisingly, the situation at the Children’s Hospital seems to be positive. However, the major drawback is the lack of space, especially when the country is faced with Dengue in ‘epidemic’ proportions!!!  Three or four children are compelled to share one bed, which is not only uncomfortable for the children but totally unhygienic as well!!! There is a desperate need for another Children’s Hospital.  Instead of concentrating on putting up more high rises, the Government has not addressed the necessity of building another Children’s Hospital. We wonder why issues of national importance are always put on the back burner!!!   FATHER GRANFATHER RAPE CHILD In today’s newspaper, we read that in Meetiyagoda, the father and grandfather no less, have BOTH raped a 7 –year-old girl!  This is the Buddhist country we live in, the country that condones such brutality, that allows these perverted swine to get away with such heinous acts of RAPE on THEIR INNOCENT CHILDREN!!!  WHY, WHY, WHY CAN’T WE BRING IN SOME REAL PUNISHMENT FOR THESE culprits INSTEAD OF JUST SENDING THEM TO JAIL??? WHY CAN’T WE DO WHAT THEY DO IN SAUDI ARABIA? DISMEMBER THEM! IF IT IS DONE ONCE, NOT ANOTHER COWARD WILL DARE TO RAPE ANOTHER CHILD!!  KEEP READING FOR MORE HORRIFIC EXPOSURES ON THE REALITIES OF BUDDHISM, PERPETRATED IN THIS COUNTRY BY THE SO-CALLED VENERABLE MONKS THEMSELVES!!!THE VOICE     "

"February tourist arrivals up 19% with China upsurge","2018-03-09 10:14:36							0						 				1430","China regains top source market position after 18 months lapse	Second consecutive month of double digit growth in arrivalsTourism arrivals to Sri Lanka in 2018 continued to grow in double digits for the second consecutive month in February, with China reclaiming the top spot as the largest tourist sourcing country after a lapse of 18 months, according to data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.Arrivals to the island reached 235,618 tourists, which was a 19.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase over February 2017. The partial closure of the airport in the first 4 months of 2017 had contributed to a lower base figure for tourist arrivals to grow from.Last month also saw the second consecutive month of double digit arrivals, signalling a return to Sri Lanka’s normal tourism growth rate this year, after 2017 turned out disappointing for the tourism industry, with most months recording low single digit, and at times negative arrivals growth, resulting in just 3.2 percent YoY growth for 2017.Western Europe remained the largest regional market for Sri Lanka’s tourism industry during the waning winter period with 82,310 arrivals which was a 7.2 percent growth YoY despite political uncertainty in the Eurozone. The British market expanded 17.8 percent YoY attracting 23,817 tourists. The number of Germans visiting Sri Lanka increased 16 percent YoY to 17,066 tourists, while 16,871 French visited the island, which was a 21.3 percent growth YoY.The second largest regional market was East Asia, with 50,192 arrivals, growing at a rate of 21.1 percent YoY during the month in which the Traditional Chinese New Year Falls, after recording negative growth last year.Chinese arrivals grew by 42.3 percent YoY to 35,929 tourists, while arrivals from Japan grew by 10.6 percent YoY to 5,263 tourists.Arrivals from South Asia meanwhile grew by 17.2 percent YoY to 41,177 tourists led by a 25.1 percent YoY increase in arrivals from India, from where 32,914 tourists were sourced. Arrivals from the Maldives, where political unrest continues, fell by 7.4 percent YoY to 4,726 tourists.Arrivals from Eastern Europe grew by 20.3 percent YoY to 28,601 tourists. Arrivals from Russia and Ukraine both grew slightly above average, bringing in 11,043 and 5,138 tourists respectively. Notably, the Polish market grew by 70.3 percent YoY to 3,195 tourists as well.The North American market grew by 27.5 percent YoY to 10,823 tourists, while the Australasian market too grew at an identical rate, bringing in 6,357 tourists. Arrivals from the Middle East however contracted by 29.6 percent YoY to 3,894 tourists.The first two months of this year saw the arrival of 474,542 tourists, which was a 13.8 percent growth YoY. With the continued absence of a tourism promotions campaign, the arrivals trend appears to have returned to the diminishing growth trend witnessed up to 2016, when setting aside 2017, where natural disasters, a dengue epidemic and the airport closure resulted in a flat year.  "
"Kandy violence leads tourists to cancel visits","2018-03-09 09:53:47							0						 				7177","Leading tour operators seeing some cancellation of visits	Tourism authorities highlight wide-ranging economic implications of short-sighted actions	SriLankan Airlines says closely monitoring situation  By Chandeepa WettasingheThe religious and communal violence that erupted in Kandy could end up stymying the momentum built up in the tourism industry over the past three months, as signs are emerging that foreign tourists are cancelling their visits to Sri Lanka.Over 80 tourists have cancelled their bookings made at one of the top three travel companies in Sri Lanka, which could possibly amount to a loss of 800 nights, Mirror Business learns.This is despite the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) constantly issuing updates on the situation, and working with tourism stakeholders and the police to ensure the safety of tourists in the Central district.Attempts to reach the top management of most of the leading travel companies and the two apex industry bodies—Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) and The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) were unsuccessful, as most were in attendance at ITB Berlin, the largest travel trade show in the world.Back home, SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayake hit back strongly against individuals and groups inciting religious and ethnic tension.“This is a wakeup call that shows the significance and the gravity of immature action on the part of those who contributed to this situation. The next time before someone throws a stone, or engages in any kind of road-rage, they should think ten times of the wide-ranging economic consequences of their actions,” he said.Ratnayake said that the tourism industry is projected to be the leading foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka in two years, and the society should understand the importance of preserving a peaceful environment to sustain the growth of the industry.“The loss of income affects not only the major hotels, but also the street seller, the tuk-tuk driver, the farmer and the restaurant worker,” he added.The tourism industry was just getting back into gear after 2017 turned out to be a disappointment with a partial airport closure and a dengue epidemic, which resulted in nearly flat growth.Relatively moderate growth last December was followed up by double-digit growth in January and February this year from key markets due to the winter season and the Chinese New Year, before the current tension in the major tourism hub of Kandy spurted.Sparks flew with a roadside brawl over a truck driver thwarting a three-wheeler from overtaking, which resulted in the latter assaulting the truck driver who passed away from the wounds sustained.The incident escalated into communal violence, with residents of the area fanning flames of religious hatred over the fact that the truck driver was Buddhist and the assailants were Muslim.Another death of a Muslim resulted in the ensuing chaos.Foreign media provided wide coverage on the developments, and the US, British, UAE and Australian governments issued travel advisories for their residents visiting Sri Lanka.However, the national carrier SriLankan Airlines, which flies most of the tourists to Sri Lanka, issued a statement, which said that it has yet to see a massive cancellation trend.“There could be some cancellations. We are closely monitoring the situation, but so far we are unaffected,” SriLankan said.A source within the airline yesterday said that it would take a day or two before the airline could state whether cancellations have substantially increased due to the situation.The unrest would not only result in cancellations by tourists who were set to visit Sri Lanka shortly, but would also discourage potential bookings for the coming months. Area returns to normalcy 	Tourists can resume their travel plans-SLTDAAccording to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), the volatile situation in the Kandy area is returning to normalcy, allowing tourists to resume their travel plans.“The situation in Kandy is improving and the area is fast returning to normalcy. No violent incident has been reported from the district in the last 18 hours. Accordingly, the curfew has been lifted by the police and tourists can resume their travel plans to Kandy,” it said.Communal violence had resulted in the government imposing a curfew in the affected region, along with a social media blackout.The state tourism office, along with the travel and tourism industry had worked with the local police authorities to issue passes for tourists to move out of the area during the curfew periods on Wednesday.The SLTDA stressed that the situation in Kandy has no impact whatsoever on the other parts of Sri Lanka, and that it, along with all industry stakeholders are working to ensure that tourists are safe during their travels within Sri Lanka.Communal violence had resulted in the government imposing a curfew in the affected region, along with a social media blackout.The state tourism office, along with the travel and tourism industry had worked with the local police authorities to issue passes for tourists to move out of the area during the curfew periods on Wednesday.The SLTDA stressed that the situation in Kandy has no impact whatsoever on the other parts of Sri Lanka, and that it, along with all industry stakeholders is working to ensure that tourists are safe during their travels within Sri Lanka.   "
"NBTS seeks blood brothers!","2018-03-08 01:53:16							0						 				2284","Donating blood is a meritorious deed that helps save many lives. The National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), attached to the Ministry of Health, is a decentralized unit which is the sole supplier of blood and blood products to state hospitals, including private institutions registered under the Ministry of Health. The NBTS recently announced that there is an impending risk of going through a blood shortage from the period of January to April this year.   According to NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa, approximately 400 to 450 thousand units of blood from voluntary blood donors are collected annually by the NBTS island wide. Any volunteer between the ages of 18 and 55 with a healthy body weight not less than 50 Kg can donate blood whereas in the case of a regular blood donor, the individual can donate blood up to the age of 60 years. Moreover, it is crucial to ensure that the donor is physically fit and is not under medication for any chronic illness or is not suffering from any disease or infection. It isn’t recommended for an individual to donate blood if he or she has traveled abroad within the past three months at the time of the blood donation. While a whole blood donor can donate blood every four months, it should be noted that platelet donors can donate blood after a two week interval.    Shortage of Blood Expressing his views to the Daily Mirror, Director of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) Dr. Rukshan Bellana said that during the period between January and April, a blood shortage is experienced every year. He said that the situation could worsen in the event an election is held during the given period.   “It is a usual phenomenon to experience a blood shortage between January and April annually. We experienced this shortage this year too. On top of that, we had the elections in February. During the election period, it is normal to witness a drop in the blood supply. This year, both these factors coincided,” Dr. Bellana stated.   “If we don’t do anything about it, we will walk into a crisis by next month or April. We have carried out a massive campaign during the past two or three weeks through our blood bank networks,” he added.   The NBTS has been instrumental in carrying out several effective blood donation campaigns throughout the country in a bid to raise awareness on the importance of donating blood while ensuring that the risk of an impending blood shortage would be countered via such an endeavour. Stating that the recent blood campaign that was held in Kaththankudi was a success, Dr. Bellana added that it was the first time in history that a blood donation campaign was held in Kaththankudi. The campaign attracted 600 donors and to date this has been the highest ever statistic associated with a blood donation campaign held in the Batticaloa District. The blood donation campaign at Kaththankudi was organized by a Senior Consultant of Classic Travels (Pvt) Ltd and social worker, Rizwan Hafiz in collaboration with the NBTS.   We have carried out a massive campaign during the past two or three weeks through our blood bank networks“Among the donors, the majority were represented by the Muslim community. Among them there were also ladies with burkhas who volunteered to donate blood. Their participation has helped dispel recent rumors, that it is considered bad to donate blood according to their religious practice. We held a similar campaign last Saturday (Feb. 17) in the Batticaloa town with nearly 160 donors. Though this campaign didn’t attract a big crowd, it was nevertheless a record set for the Batticaloa region when considering statistics of the past couple of years.   “So, we have stepped up the campaign activities and we are seeing some improvement. We are seeing how people are coming and extending support to this noble cause. Given the situation, I hope we might not run into a crisis, but we would have definitely experienced one if we had not acted in advance,” Dr. Bellana said.   A successful blood donation campaign is often a joint endeavor of several groupsUpon inquiring about how Colombo has coped with the situation pertaining to an impending blood shortage, he said that Colombo is always the highest in terms of available blood donors since it is congested with the highest population. However, noting that the same could not be applied in the case of Batticaloa, Dr. Bellana said that this was one of the main reasons why a blood donation campaign was organized in the said region. Highlighting that the situation in Hambantota is very unsatisfactory at present, Dr. Bellana informed that the NBTS is planning to organize its next blood donation campaign in this town in the near future.   “In the overall, we are doing well in certain regions and not so well in other regions. I don’t think Batticaloa will be a problem hereafter because we have had a good campaign here. Also, we have raised awareness among people and blood donation has been promoted among them.The blood donated by donors, free of charge, during the campaign is collected and stored. Then we issue this to the public and private sectors for medical reasons as per their needs,” he added.    Accidents and Traumas Explaining that accidents and traumas make up a high number of cases which demand blood, he added that surgeries which are growing in numbers, and are an everyday occurrence, have a greater demand for blood supply. Thalassaemia and cancer patients also require blood very often.“Not so long ago, we used to supply a lot of blood to treat dengue patients. Now since the treatment patterns have changed, not much blood is required to treat dengue patients although earlier we had a huge demand in this aspect. The number of major diseases, surgeries and accidents has increased at present, which is why we need more blood. It should also be noted when you take the Sri Lankan community, O+ is the type of blood that is mostly available within the community. O-, AB- and AB+ blood groups are very rare in the public,” Dr.Bellana said.    Organizing a Blood Donation Campaign To take part in this noble venture, it is important to know how to organize a blood donation campaign in one’s locality. Deemed to be a meritorious act, donating blood for those in need is indeed a good cause that would save many lives. Enlightening us on the procedure, NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa shared her views on the subject. She said that it would be ideal to arrange blood donation camps during the April festive season and that blood donors are most welcome to donate blood.   “A successful blood donation campaign is often a joint endeavor of several groups comprising Government and non-government organizations, private institutions, friends and volunteer groups. It should be noted that at least 50 donors should take part in a week day donor campaign whereas a weekend donor campaign is expected to attract at least 100 donors. On the other hand, a volunteer can donate blood at the premises of National Blood Centre Narahenpita anytime between 8.00 am and 6.00 pm. This centre is open all 365 days of the year. Donors can also donate blood at any of the hospital based blood banks between 8.00 am and 4.00 pm,” Dr. Saranajeewa said.   Among the donors, the majority were represented by the Muslim communityExplaining further on how to arrange a campaign, Dr. Saranajeewa said that the camp premise should be a familiar location to donors comprising sanitary facilities such as a washroom in addition to facilities such as parking space, clean and be a calm atmosphere. While laying emphasis that the NBTS doesn’t approve anyone except volunteers as donors, she further highlighted that organizers will be called for a meeting by respective blood bank networks prior to hosting the campaign to educate them on the procedures pertaining to organizing the event. The necessary equipment for blood transfusion would be provided by the NBTS.   “Mass blood mobiles with the participation of 1000 to 3000 donors are generally conducted by the National Blood Centre and Cluster Centre blood banks since they have the required capacity. Additionally, the NBTS wishes to invite the public to celebrate their life events by organizing a blood donation campaign at the blood bank premises. Also, those who are willing to donate blood can register themselves at the NBTS, which maintains a donor registry. This is very useful for the NBTS in the event of an emergency, in which case the NBTS can call and request a registered donor to donate blood” added Dr. Saranajeewa.     "

We have been able to maintain our steady growth momentum despite a considerable rise in claim settlements thanks to our strong fundamentals and prudent reinsurance structure. The year 2018 will be a year of change resulting from the divestment of the Non-Life business. We are optimistic that the opportunities arising from a singular focus on theLife Insurance business, coupled with the opportunity of rebuilding an efficient distribution system, will strengthen our presence in the Sri Lankan Life Insurance industry.”The total Consolidated Assets of the company grew by 15% YoY, standing at Rs. 36.848 billion at the end of the period under review with the investment portfolio accounting for Rs. 25.523 billion of this value.

"When blood refuses to clot","2018-02-09 14:27:47							0						 				2993"," Blood is an essential life sustaining component in our bodies. Recall the last time you experienced a cut or injury to your body. It would most likely have been a small  wound. Remember how the blood initially discharged fast, then slowed down and stopped completely. All this happened during a short span of a few minutes. Our bodies have mechanisms to keep the blood from leaking out of the vessels. But there are certain conditions where this mechanism fails and even a small wound could be fatal. These conditions are called bleeding disorders. Today in Health Capsule, we present an interview done with Dr.K.A.C Wickramaratne, Consultant Haematologist and Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine, Karapitiya, during which he spoke at length when answering questions about bleeding disorders.  Q What is Haemostasis?   In order to carry out its functions optimally, blood should be maintained as a fluid inside the vessel and should clot immediately if the vessel is damaged. If blood form solid ‘clots’ inside blood vessels, it may lead to death of the patient. In such instances death will come in the form of a heart attack or a brain attack. On the other hand, when a blood vessel is damaged bleeding has to stop immediately which happens as a result of the forming of a blood clot at the site of injury. If this doesn’t happen the person would bleed out. There should be a delicate balance between the two because a slight tip of balance either way could be fatal. This process is called haemostasis.   Q How does a wound stop bleeding following an injury?   Clotting of blood after a vessel is damaged is a complex process with the participation of multiple factors. To make a long story short, von Willebrand factor (vWF), a special protein in blood, binds to a protein called collagen in the damaged site. This makes way for platelets, the small disc like particles in the blood to come and bind at the site, which then attracts more platelets to the site. So, a blood clot is formed, blocking the leaking of blood.   To make the platelet plug solid and retainable, a crisscrossing meshwork of fibrin is formed as a result of a cascade activating a series of proteins in plasma, called coagulation proteins. This process, called coagulation, stops the bleeding completely, anchoring the platelet clump. The final process looks after the healing of the wound, which includes the gradual breakage of the anchoring meshwork that is replaced by vessel wall tissues.   Q What happens during a bleeding disorder?   A bleeding disorder is any problem in the factors or components required for the complete clot formation. That includes platelets, von Willebrand factor, collagen and all the coagulation factors.    These can have two problems; reduced concentration below the required levels and the defective function of the factor.   These diseases are commonly acquired due to diseases in the body. E.g.: platelets are reduced when dengue fever is present. Coagulation proteins reduce to levels below normal. This condition occurs during liver disease such as cirrhosis. When these components are not adequate or not working appropriately, people experience bleeding disorders. Some of these conditions are acquired in later life or may be coming from generations down as l (inherited) diseases. Low platelets can also be seen with blood cancers or related diseases. The platelet function can also be inhibited by drugs taken for heart attacks such as apirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole etc.   Q How do these patients present?   The patients present with excessive and unusual bleeding, including heavy bleeding from a minor injury or during some instances spontaneous. They may complain of bleeding on the skin with no trauma or unusual blood stains in saliva, blood in urine, nose bleeds etc. Women can have heavy periods; a condition called menorrhagia.   When platelets or vWF is present in blood  in very low amounts or if these are defective, bleeding occurs mainly into the skin and mucosa. Dot like bleeding patches, bleeding from gums, nasal bleeding, big patches of bleeding spots and profuse bleeding following trauma are common in these patients.   When coagulation factors are defective or less, bleeding usually occurs some time after. This type of bleeding is seen as bleeding into joints (haemarthrosis) or big bleeds into muscles (haematoma).   A typical story in many patients with this condition is heavy bleeding following a tooth extraction. If the bleeding is immediate it is most likely due to a problem in platelets or vWF. If there was no bleeding issue after extraction and if the patient starts bleeding some times later, this is usually a problem in coagulation factors.    Q What are the common bleeding disorders seen today?   Von Willebrand DiseaseThis is the commonest out of all the bleeding disorders, with one in hundred individuals having the disease. It is inherited and may go unnoticed as ‘something normal’ in the family; specially among females. For instance the women in these families tend to have heavier menstrual periods than normal.   Haemophilia This is a very rare disease, with only around 2000 patients being present in all of Sri Lanka. Haemophilia occurs due to a deficiency of some coagulation factors. Commonly it is the deficiency of factor VIII or IX (different factors are named with roman letters). This disease is transmitted from genes; ex: mother to son. Females generally do not have main disease. Therefore, maternal uncles with bleeding problem could be indicative of haemophilia. These patients can present at toddler age, with bleeding into joints when trying to stand.   Q  How do you treat patients with bleeding disorders?   Patient education on various bleeding patterns is vital during treatment.   Coagulation defects such as haemophilia can be treated by giving periodic injections. Nowadays patients are trained to receive injections at home. In main hospitals haematologists have established haemophilia day centres to provide better care for such patients. These patients should be advised to avoid contact sports and to keep away from risky behaviours.   Platelet problems demand proper identification of the underlying disease. Steroids may be prescribed during some immune diseases.   They should not take Aspririn or related drugs without proper consultation of a doctor due to the risk of bleeding. They should always alert the doctor about their condition whenever they seek medical care.   "

"Vote for the party you think will protect your rights as a citizen : Eran Wickramaratne","2018-02-06 14:41:22							2						 				2089","The local government election has been marked as an important day in the political calendar. With many promises and plans, candidates both senior and amateur have started working for the people. Finance State Minister EranWickramaratne is positive about the changes that have taken place after the present government was elected to office. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Eran shared his thoughts about the challenges faced by the economy during the previous years while encouraging the people to use their vote wisely at the upcoming election.Excerpts :    Q: Colombo is a UNP stronghold. How confident are you that the UNP will win this time?A: When talking about an election, we need to look at the team as well as their manifesto. Since there’s a new law for the local government election there are suitable candidates nominated in other districts as well. Especially there’s a 25% presentation for women as well. The UNP has put forward a formidable team in Colombo led by Rosy Senanayake. Sri Lanka will have its first elected female mayor. Rosy is an experienced politician and she even served as the Ambassador for Malaysia. The work she has done in Sri Lanka and overseas has been commended by many people. She has a formidable team of professionals supporting her for the upcoming election. Teamwork is an absolute must in delivering results. The manifesto presented by Rosy Senanayake has highlighted on many services. A year and a half ago, this government decidedto have an ambulance service and many people criticized it from time to time. We rolled out this service in the districts of Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Colombo,Gampaha and Kalutara. One year after, the results were amazing. In less than 13 minutes, when you call 1990, an ambulance turns up at your doorstep or wherever the accident has taken place. This is how technology has been used to make services more efficient. Rosy Senanayake will make use of technology to make services more efficient within the municipality by introducing a service centre. In addition to that the city has many problems. Urban renewal programmes are needed. When you put up buildings you need to make sure that they adhere to the law and therefore the zoning has to be done properly. In addition to that there are other services that the citizens require. You need a clean environment, you need your garbage to be collected on time, you need your drains to be cleared and you need to fight the dengue menace. She has plans for these. In addition to that she is also planning to bring in vocational training facilities for the residents of Colombo in order upscale the income in lower income areas. Therefore the UNP has the people and the plan and therefore I urge you to vote for the UNP. If there are five votes at your home, it would be imperative that you use all five votes because this election is not only about electing your local member; it’s also about getting a majority. Even though there are no preferential votes, this is a proportional representation election, therefore every vote counts. Q :One of the major accusations from the Opposition is that the present government couldn’t bring in Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) as promised in 2015. But in 2016 a larger number of FDIs were brought in. What are your comments?A : When we took over reins of government in January 2015 this country was facing a crisis. There is a huge debt burden and this has increased over the last period. Our debt has increased and our foreign currency debt has increased. In addition to that we have replaced concessional debt with commercial debt so the entire debt profile has increased. The former government maintained an artificial Rupee-Dollar rate and when you maintain such a Rupee-Dollar rate you always understate your debt. When you free your currency to the market rate exchange rate naturally the real debt is reflected in rupees. So the increase in debt during this period has more to do with the currency being a free market currency than our government borrowing. This is the economy we inherited. The first two and a half years has gone to stabilize the economy. By freeing the exchange rate we have also been able to give exporters a wonderful opportunity to compete with the real world. In the past period under the SLFP-led government exports which were more than 30% of GDP had come down gradually to 14% of GDP. Exports are needed if we want to keep our living standards rising. So we have freed the exchange rate and therefore exports are rising too. Exports have increased in the past year by nearly 10% and this is a wonderful sign. GSP Plus has been achieved after our new government took office. Its benefits will be seen over the 2018-2019 period. Also there was a ban from the European Union on fishing exports from Sri Lanka which too has been lifted. This year alone fishing exports have increased by 39%. Confidence has returned. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is able to target inflation the old nexus between the government and the CBSL during the previous period has been broken. FDIs from USD 750 million during the last year has more than doubled to USD 1.8 billion in 2017. I think 2017 has been the watershed year and we are going to see the benefits in managing the economy prudently in 2018 and 2019. More investments, more jobs, more exports and rising living standards will be seen.Q: As a senior politician, what is your message to all UNP supporters in view of the upcoming election?A: On February 10, we have an opportunity to vote in our local governments across the country. Voting is an important right that the citizens have. We need to use that vote to protect democracy. On January 8, 2015 the citizens of this country voted for a change. That was a big change. We know that just a week ago, the President of this country went to the Supreme Court and asked a question; “Do I have five years or six years to govern?” The SC unanimously gave a verdict on that question and said that he has only five years. It’s very much different to the past. In the past if a question like that was asked in the SC they may have hesitated. But now the court is independent. The decisions are made based on the principles of law. The reason why I say this is because it wasn’t long ago when the Chief Justice of this country was kicked out of her office by the executive using the Parliament as an instrument. That is one of the darkest moments in our history. We have reinstated the independence of the judiciary and through the 19A we have strengthened the rights and position of the citizens. We brought in a new act giving citizens a Right to Information. You can use this right. As you elect your members you can go and find out how money was spent, what were it spent on and the quality of the investments and expenditures that they were doing. Citizens in Europe had this right over 200 years ago and citizens in South Asia had it more recently. But our citizens didn’t have this right until our government was voted in. Remember that in this election, when you discharge your civic responsibility you are voting to protect democracy. There may be shortcomings in our government but it has stood strongly for democracy and justice. The process may be slow and you may be disappointed sometimes that the outcomes haven’t come in the way you expected. But I can tell this for sure; we are on the right track and we are at the beginning of this journey and once we continue down this road, we will be the beneficiaries of a better society. So on February 10, vote for the party you think will protect your rights as a citizen."
"‘We’re a strong party supporting the Tamil population’","2018-02-06 00:57:56							0						 				5118","UPA’s Karuppiah Ramakrishnan representing the Kirula Ward wants montessoris that teach children in Tamil      The Local Government Elections are four days away and all candidates are gearing up for the big event. Contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) from the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Karuppiah Ramakrishnan representing the Kirula Ward has a vision to work towards transparency in politics. Having completed his degree in media at the University of Sri Jayawardanapura, Ramakrishnan has over 10 years of work experience as a sports journalist and has contributed to a leading English newspaper in the country. Speaking to the Daily mirror  , Ramakrishnan shared his plans for Colombo and its people.   QWhy did you want to enter politics? For me politics is a volunteer service. I have been involved in Rotaract and other youth activities and have always worked for the community. People join politics to earn more bucks and this is where they go wrong. Our party led by Mano Ganesan has produced two cabinet ministers and one state minister. At the provincial council level we have 16 members. We’re a strong party supporting the Tamil population and as a youngster I wanted to be involved in it to make a change.   QHow challenging is the new electoral system for newcomers? It is very easy to work under the new system. Each representative has to look after his or her particular ward. If the people vote for the correct person he or she will make sure that the people are very well represented. Now they don’t have to go collecting a higher number of votes from each city to win an entire electorate. Nobody can have his or her own way with this system and that is another positive. We can all work independently for the benefit of the people.   QThere are many Tamil people in Colombo. As a minority what major issues do they face? Issues in Colombo are common to all its people. Although we talk about just four lakhs of people in Colombo we need to consider upgrading the infrastructure facilities to benefit people visiting Colombo on a daily basis. The CMC should set an example to the rest of the municipal councils, but there has been very little progress over the past years. Dengue is another issue we need to concentrate on. I don’t remember the CMC being represented by a Tamil mayor during the past few decades. I remember that just after we received independence, a Tamil mayor was elected to office for a brief 10 months. Why has it happened that way? Therefore there’s a nationalist issue here. The CMC has 16 Montessori facilities that accommodate children of low income families. But they are conducted in Sinhala medium and it’s a challenge for Tamil children. Therefore such issues need to be looked at using a more holistic approach which will benefit everyone.    Now they don’t have to go collecting a higher number of votes from each city to win an entire electorate. Nobody can have his or her own way with this system and that is another positive. We can all work independently for the benefit of the people.    QWhat are your plans for Colombo? Dengue is one of the major issues. The only solution for dengue is fumigation which is bad for the environment. It not only kills the mosquitoes, but it disrupts the food cycle as well. Therefore it’s not a practical solution. We need to encourage people to stay clean and make sure that their gardens are properly maintained. That way this issue could be solved. Other countries don’t carry out fumigation to control the mosquito issue. If not for the British, the CMC wouldn’t even have had a building today. The UNP was in power for 60 years and what have they done?   Another issue is that the CMC introduced an e-Tax Online Payment system. But this system could be extended to other services as well. Therefore technology could be effectively used to make it more efficient.   Traffic needs to be controlled immediately. If the CMC puts in more thought to control traffic they could use a GPS system to indicate those entering Colombo where there is more traffic. It could be like a digital guide to Colombo showing people where they could find a washroom facility, a café and other places they would wish to visit. When we walk along Rajakeeya Mawatha, the environment is different to that in Maligawatte. Why couldn’t we plant more trees in Colombo? People in underserved developments live with minimum facilities. Some even don’t have space to pull up a clothing line and instead use a current wire to hang their wet clothes. This is the sad side of Colombo which we as a party will focus on.   QPeople have the tendency to abstain from voting as they claim that the system is corrupt. What is your message to them? If you exercise your voting rights during this election, you can elect someone who will work for your ward. Therefore people need to vote wisely. When these candidates go canvassing people can always ask for their educational qualifications and professional background, that way people can be sure about their vote. This is not the old system and therefore they do not have to worry. People have the power this time.   "
"‘We’ll be able to make a change this time’","2018-02-06 00:01:14							0						 				2028","SLPP’s Roshnie De Saram contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward believes that individuals with a professional background should be involved in politicsThe Local Government polls are a few days away and contestants are in the process of winning the hearts of people. Contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward is Roshnie De Saram under the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket. Roshnie is a proud pupil of Visakha Vidyalaya and sports a qualification in Business and Management from Australia. Belonging to a post-independence lineage of politicians, Roshnie has always been interested to serve the less fortunate.  If elected, Roshnie has big plans for Colombo and she shared her views about the upcoming polls during an interview with the Daily mirror . QWhy did you decide to contest this time?   We need to bring the country back to its former state and it is Mahinda Rajapakse who can do that. I initially supported the UNP, but I want to see change happen and therefore I decided to contest for the first time at the upcoming Local Government Elections.   QThose with professional backgrounds are seldom found in parliament. What are your views on this?   I think it’s very important that individuals with a professional background are involved in politics. Otherwise this country cannot function with people who have a lower level of education.  QColombo has many issues which were promised to be solved. The low-income households are one aspect. Is it right for politicians to make more promises to these people and in turn do nothing?   They are living under very poor conditions. Their bathrooms and other sanitary facilities need to be upgraded immediately. I think we should give them a hand to uplift their lifestyles.   QWhat are your plans for Colombo?   If I’m elected to office I will make some big changes for the benefit of my people. Some of my plans include building houses for those with special needs, eradicating dengue through efficient smoke treatment, implementing a central hotline system for prompt action to be taken; appoint committees consisting of residents, businessmen, environmentalists and professionals to be the voice of each ward. I’m also planning to have a city with an uninterrupted renewable energy system and an efficient health division for regulating food outlets and health services.   QWomen were virtually neglected in the political scene for a long time. What changes do you like to see happening with the introduction of the 25% quota for women?    I think it is one of the best decisions that was ever taken. Women do a lot of multi-tasking and we understand the requirements of every mother and sister. We need more women to be involved in the decision-making process. Mothers run the homes and their livelihoods need to be improved.   QHow important is it to implement infrastructure facilities to make the city user-friendly for differently abled people?   It definitely is a major requirement. When I visited the Wadiya I saw a boy who was begging. He was bent so badly and had no mother or father to look after him. They too need to live with dignity. It is important that they are given a proper place to stay in. They could be involved in self-employed businesses such as the incense industry. Their skills and talents such as artwork and handwork could be highlighted as well. So we need to start community centres as means of empowering them.  QPeople expected a change on January 8. Three years down the line what has the present Government achieved?   Nothing is happening today. Businesses could be improved, charity could be done, but we don’t see anything happening today. We have done our part to help the people, but they aren’t even bothered. I have helped people in my capacity, but today’s cost of living is so high. What we did for Rs. 75,000 back in the day exceeds the Rs. 100,000 limit today. Therefore it’s time to make a wise decision.   QColombo is known to be a UNP stronghold. How will you take up this challenge by contesting from the Pohottuwa?   People say that they are born UNPers. There are educated people making similar statements, but what have they got? I think they are only thinking about themselves and not of the rest of the citizens. Why can’t we change their mindsets? The former President loved the country and had a vision for it. I hope that we will be able to make a change this time.   Q What is your message to the people?   Don’t be selfish. I want to ask people to wake up and vote for what is right. Everyone is dreaming as they are being given big promises. We need to transform Colombo into a sustainable city. In order to do that, people need to be wise in taking their decisions.       "
"We need professionals to take this country forward - Chandradasa Jayasinghe","2018-02-05 00:02:45							2						 				1737","The upcoming polls have opened doors for a diverse group of individuals including professionals, youngsters and more females to contest. Representing the United National Freedom Front (UNFF) - a newly formed political party under the leadership of former Provincial Council member Maithree Gunaratne is Chandradasa Jayasinghe competing for the Sri Jayawardanapura Municipal Council from the Nawala-East Ward. Having served as a civil engineer at the State Development and Construction Corporation and an engineer at the Road Development Authority, Jayasinghe believes that more professionals need to be involved in the political system. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Jayasinghe shared his plans for Nawala.   Excerpts :    ""I believe that the present crisis situation in the country in general and in the local government in particular is due to the non-participation of professionals in governance as policymakers. Therefore I wanted to step in to make a change in the system"" Why did you want to contest for an election?  I have been indirectly involved in the political scene because some of my family members were UNPers. It was an uncle of mine who formed the Podujana Party in which I was a member. But I wasn’t involved in party politics. However I have been following the political history and as professionals we needed a party to represent the people. Then in April 2005 a few of us got together and formed the Podujana Professional Group with about nine members. Then during the previous general elections we thought of going in as an independent group and the United National Freedom Front (UNFF) was formed as the 70th political party of the country. I believe that the present crisis situation in the country in general and in the local government in particular is due to the non-participation of professionals in governance as policymakers. Therefore I wanted to step in to make a change in the system.    ""This is the fault of party leaders. They should know to get professionals involved in order to provide solutions for various matters at hand. When Lee Kwan Yew visited Sri Lanka, he wanted to make Singapore another Sri Lanka. But what has happened to Sri Lanka today?""What are your plans for Nawala?  If I am elected, I will be mainly focusing on five issues. These include the dengue problem which has caused many issues in the area. The other issue is the garbage problem which will be effectively controlled to make Nawala a beautiful city. Workplace corruption is another issue that we as a party are focusing on. As another avenue we are also looking at stopping all bribing activities which happens in local authorities and make them efficient offices where people can go and get their work done as quickly as possible. Provincial development is another main area of focus.    Many voters are disgusted by this systemFlyover causes traffic jamIn China engineers involved in politicsThe Rajagiriya flyover was one of the main projects which took place under the good governance regime. Has it been an effective solution for the traffic congestion in the area?  No, not at all. Nawala was a traffic-free city but with the flyover, traffic movement has increased. Now nobody can cross the road as well. Flyovers are not an effective solution to curb traffic.   How challenging is it to contest as a new comer of a new political party?  There are 1221 houses in this ward and I have managed to visit almost all the houses. Many voters are disgusted by this system and some are wondering whether to vote or not. I have spent time talking to them and encouraging them to use their franchise wisely. Voting is a form of participation in order to make a democratic country. I have a good relationship with other candidates as well. The people spoke to me about their problems and I have done what I can in my capacity.    "" I believe that the present crisis situation in the country in general and in the local government in particular is due to the non-participation of professionals in governance as policymakers""We don’t see many professionals in the present political system. What are your views on this?  This is the fault of party leaders. They should know to get professionals involved in order to provide solutions for various matters at hand. When Lee Kwan Yew visited Sri Lanka, he wanted to make Singapore another Sri Lanka. But what has happened to Sri Lanka today? In China there are many engineers involved in politics. This is how they have developed their country. We can’t ask a butcher to do a surgery on human and likewise, we need professionals to take this country forward.    “I am confident that at least five or six members would definitely be elected. Our party leader is an unblemished character and we want to keep our identity as professionals”What are your views about the mixed electoral system?  There is very less expenditure this time. It is only a marketing campaign which requires little money but that too doesn’t have to be exorbitant amounts. We have to concentrate on our ward and we don’t have to keep meetings because door-to-door campaigns are more effective in my opinion.   How confident are you that you would win?  I am confident that at least five or six members would definitely be elected. Our party leader is an unblemished character and we want to keep our identity as professionals. Pic by Kushan Pathiraja  "
"Rains increase threat of Dengue outbreak",,
"The municipality cannot function without the central government : Rosy Senanayake","2018-02-01 11:05:13							8						 				7971","UNP Mayoral candidate Rosy Senanayake is gearing up for the upcoming poll. Making a change in the political landscape, if elected to office, Rosy will be the first female mayor of Colombo. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Rosy spoke about a few serious concerns at hand and her future plans for the city.Q: There were various projects in your manifesto. Are such similar projects done in other countries as well?A: Yes, garbage is a classic example because in every other country garbage is a treasure. Garbage can be converted to energy and it has various other uses as well. So we are looking at finding a permanent solution for the garbage dump. In all honesty and fairness we need to understand that the previous government didn’t have a solution for this garbage issue. I have been complaining about the health hazard but they didn’t consider the repercussions of dumping it in Meethotamulla. They didn’t know what to do with the garbage because it can be categorized in to various types such as perishable, non-perishable, clinical etc. Every type of garbage could be used for various purposes and it is a money spinner as well. We are now looking at waste-to-energy projects. The Prime Minister has now found a permanent dumping place in Puttalam. We can also have a few incinerators within the city and dispose the garbage.Q: A similar issue like the garbage problem is the condominium bubble that’s coming up. Do you have plans to bring in regulations for these constructions?A: Definitely there has to be regulations because I don’t think the city can hold so many constructions. There are many illegal constructions coming up which will be a hazard. Even these waste water lines are very archaic. The population too has increased but we don’t have the capacity yet to serve the people in those areas. We are giving out a 10-year plan where we will be improving the infrastructure with regard to sewage lines, wastage lines etc which will be done in stages. Housing is one of the prime areas that I will be looking at. Proper sanitation and toilet facilities are areas which we will thoroughly concentrate on. For the past 25 years we couldn’t do much in the city simply because the central government was not from the party. Colombo has been a UNP stronghold and it is our heart but we have received step-motherly treatment.Q: Projects such as the Independence Arcade and the Floating Market incurred losses. How will you make them profitable ventures?A: There are ways and means in making a project profitable. There are many aspects we need to focus on, one being that of women. There are women who work as domestic aides since they need to earn a living. But we need to look at empowering them and allow them to stand on their own feet. Finance is a big issue because even for a woman to start her own catering business, she needs money to make it happen. It is important that we strengthen the livelihoods of women especially in the Colombo city limits. In my manifesto I have promised to have 25 community centers in areas where the municipality’s services are needed. We can start a Grameen banking system where women can get collaterals and other benefits when they face certain difficulties in life. We also need to focus on children because what happens today is that they just go to school and even if they fail or not they end up riding a three-wheeler. . But they need to be trained to take on basic challenges in life. There will be three vocational training centers for the youth thereby addressing the unemployment issue as well.Q: Poor conditions of the road network is a complain all citizens have. How will you upgrade them?A: That is another key area that we are focusing on. The municipality cannot function without the central government. They cannot carry out some of their projects without the municipality. So it’s a two-way system. There will be a flyover project, underground transport and canal transport as well. We are planning some mega projects with the Megapolis Ministry. We will take the services to the people. So the people have to come to the Colombo municipality and get their work done. But this time the service will be made more efficient so that they don’t have to pay repeated visits to get one job done. They complain that they have to bribe somebody to get things done. Bribery and corruption will totally be eradicated. Dengue is one of the biggest hazards that we have faced. If the city is clean and the water is flowing; if we have smart sewage lines and other technology we will be able to eradicate the dengue mosquito. On the other hand participatory citizens are a must and I will be having townhall meetings to listen to the likes, grievances and suggestions of people.Q: How confident are you that you will win?A: I’m very confident about my win. Colombo municipality is untouchable we have never lost. I want to win so that I don’t have to draw an alliance with somebody else. I have a team of professionals who can help us to deliver at the end of the day. I also want to encourage the general public to be a part of the system."
"GOvt. has shown they aren’t  capable of delivering -Sharmila Gonawela","2018-02-01 00:06:44							1						 				5977"," The battle for Local Government Elections is heating up. An election should benefit the people, irrespective of symbols like the Pohottuwas, Beetle leaves or Elephants through which they come into power. Several decades down the line, people are still hoping for a better country. Sharmila Gonawela is contesting from the Bambalapitiya Ward for the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) under the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket. Speaking to the Dailymirror, Gonawela spoke about the challenges she faced being a Municipal Councillor back in 2002 and what she is planning to do if elected.   Excerpts :   QYou were a member of the CMC before. What made you contest again?  I was a member back in 2002 and I won under the UNP ticket. I was the only woman sitting with 52 other men. I have fought corruption and malpractices, but I never got the support that I needed from the party. Thereafter I went to the Bribery Commission, the CID and other Presidential Commissions with documentation to complain about all these issues. Eventually I stepped down from politics after four years. But in 2010 after the war concluded I voted for Mahinda because I thought it was the duty of all Sri Lankans. He invited me this time and I therefore decided to contest under the SLPP ticket.    If I can be the Mayor of Colombo who has worked for the city after 60 years, who has built up a greener, healthier and an IT-friendly city and if people say that all this was done by a woman, I would be the happiest. I’m also sure that I can be that person as well QBack in 2002, women were rarely involved in the political scene when compared to the present time. What challenges did you face back then?  There were some men who were very supportive. But when I went in I was the only woman sitting there. Some would bring in bottles and get drunk at official meetings and then I requested for a private area. I even refused to use the toilets there because they were in a row with just one door. Although I requested for a separate room, neither the party nor the councilors backed me. They feared that I would get more power if I went in to a separate room. So my requests were more often than not, turned down.    QWhat are your views on operationalizing the 25% quota for women in politics?  It’s an excellent move. Women have to be encouraged to be in politics. They are more sensitive towards issues and we also want to change the political culture. We need to be more transparent and ensure a corruption-free society. We have 5% of Parliamentarians who are women, but what have they really spoken about? There was an issue of a 14-year-old girl who was raped in Down South and she then took her life. We also have the incident where the Uva Province Chief Minister made a teacher kneel down. But has any female Parliamentarian made any statement with regard to these issues? When my opponent candidate Rosy was in the Women’s and Children’s Affairs ministry, there was a complaint made regarding the rape of an underaged girl by a powerful cabinet minister’s son. But was any action taken? With regard to the Bond Issue, Rosy was in the COPE committee and during the 100 days inquiry a vote was called for and she didn’t come and vote. The son was accused of it. But she went and sat with Sujeewa Senasinghe when he launched the book. So aiding and abetting is equal to being corrupt.   QHow challenging is the political game today with the implementation of the Mixed Electoral System?  I’m on the National List and looking after the Bambalapitiya Ward. Just because women’s representation was increased, if the number of councillors is being increased from 53 to 113, we are still placing the burden on the people. As at now, we don’t see any service being rendered to the people. We are adding to the 53 who are already available, so it’s the rate payer who will be deprived of their services which they should be getting. I feel it’s not very practical. With the increase the general council meetings have been shifted elsewhere and Rs. 25 lakhs is being charged per sitting. In addition to that the existing members’ room is being renovated to accommodate 113 members, but what if this system is a failure? What will they do with 113 seats?   I must say that I have received good feedback, especially from Muslim ladies. People in Colombo have come to realise that they get nothing out of the rates they have been paying for 60 long years. The Government has shown that they aren’t capable of delivering anything. I feel that there’s a big swing QWhat are your plans for Colombo?  In 2003 I spoke of a greener Colombo. I also spoke of a separate bus line for women in the city. We need to implement these things. Also with regard to the traffic congestion in Colombo we can only talk of sky trains and a good city bus service run by the private sector. The transport system comes under the Central Government and the city bus service is the only thing we can depend on. Garbage is another issue. Way back we had the ‘Kunu mola watte’ in Kirulapona and Central Colombo. Garbage was brought here and burnt. Today this ‘Kunu mola watte’ is called Nagaswatte and has been turned into a low-income housing area. People made a living at ‘Kunu mola watte’ by segregating plastic, cardboard and other materials which were eventually sold. The segregation was done free-of-charge because people had an interest in collecting them. This has come to a halt as well.   It was the UNP that led the CMC for 60 years. During those 60 years they had no plan. Of course Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had a good plan for garbage, but as they came in, it was stopped due to political reasons. But I believe that we have to stop thinking politically and look at result-oriented approaches for the people. If they continued what Gota started, people would have said this is Gota’s project, but this garbage problem wouldn’t have emerged today. Dengue is another result of this garbage problem. The rate payer pays rates for garbage collection and disposal. If the council has no proper plan for garbage they also cannot penalise the rate payer. Today we have over 100 engineers in the Council and we privatise garbage collection and disposal.   The low-income houses are another aspect I’m considering. If every district has officials looking after the area, then under whose advice or assistance do these unauthorised structures come up daily? It’s all politically motivated. If you are from a low income family I would encourage you to build a separate house because I’m sure of your vote. But after a few years you need to be fed, provided with basic amenities such as roofing sheets and also with ‘pin padi’ (A dole) – which is received by 13,000 people in the city. This is just a political hub of one party and the rate payers are maintaining Colombo for this party to win.    QDoes it mean that the UNP has not found any practical solution for the past 60 years?  Yes. I’m directly challenging the party’s Mayoral Candidate. She is talking about a greener Colombo, but her answer to mitigate the mosquito menace is to cut down huge trees. Who would have a heart to cut trees? How can you run a city like that? We have 13,000 people receiving ‘pin padi’ so can’t we get them to plant a tree each? We also have maternity centres and medicine clinics. We also have one laboratory and Ayurveda clinic as well in addition to all the staff that is required. If we can strengthen these establishments I’m sure we can stop the traffic congestion near the general hospitals. We have the money and the infrastructure, but the priority has been on politically motivated issues.    QBut the majority of the people have always supported the UNP. Do you still think that after all these years, they would vote for the your party this time?  It was a UNP hub. But in my area I have walked into every house unlike my opponent candidate who goes round throwing leaflets into every house.The response has been very good. The UNP was confident that the minorities were with them. I must say that I have received good feedback, especially from Muslim ladies. People in Colombo have come to realise that they get nothing out of the rates they have been paying for 60 long years. The Government has shown that they aren’t capable of delivering anything. I feel that there’s a big swing.   QThe past regime carried out various city beautification projects and they appeared to be practical in front of the citizens. But why do you think people voted for the present regime instead?  I wasn’t politically involved when it happened, but I believe that they trusted a lot of wrong people. I think Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR) didn’t take appropriate actions when he had to take them. The correct message wasn’t conveyed to him, at times.    QAs you said earlier, you have voiced out on corruption and malpractices. The present regime has appointed various commissions to probe into these matters. What are your views?  The Government appointed commissions one month before the elections. Thajudeen or Lasantha cannot be brought back. They started investigations, but it was stuck somewhere. The people who were rumoured to be involved in these cases were never questioned to begin with. MR and Namal were accused of having accounts in Dubai and so on. So why can’t they question the accused? The opposition now has enough evidence to probe into corrupt practices that have been taking place for the past three years.    QHow confident are you that you will win?  I’m 100% confident. I’m challenging my opponent and I’m going to defeat her in her own Ward. If she doesn’t win her own Ward she can’t be Mayor. I as a woman I would like to be a woman Mayor of Colombo, but I wouldn’t just want to be the first woman Mayor of Colombo. If I can be the Mayor of Colombo who has worked for the city after 60 years, who has built up a greener, healthier and an IT-friendly city and if people say that all this was done by a woman, I would be the happiest. I’m also sure that I can be that person as well. I strongly feel that a Mayor is not just an administrator. We have a staff comprising highly educated engineers and also those people who collect garbage. We have a very strong political wing which is represented by different political parties. The Mayor has to be someone who is good in administration and also someone who has a political background."
"International Infection Prevention Week Prevention better than cure","2018-10-19 11:26:26							0						 				2789"," International Infection Prevention Week (IIPV) falls onto the 3rd week of October annually. According to the World Health Organization, infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in developing countries and the second major cause of death worldwide, after cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, infections have the ability to cause major damage to an individual as well as the society as a whole. That is why we decided to consult Dr. Kushlani Jayatilleke, Consultant Microbiologist, Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital and President of the Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists, in this week’s Health Capsule to enlighten readers about the exceedingly timely topic of infection prevention.InfectionsBefore talking about prevention of infections, it is important to identify what an infection is. An infection is a disease condition caused by a micro organism which is not visible to the naked eye. Our body contains more micro organisms than it contains human cells, most of which actually help us, so not all these micro organisms are harmful. Infections can be categorised in a number of ways. These infections can be classified as bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal. They can also be grouped according to the site of the infection; infections in the upper respiratory tract as upper respiratory infections, infections in the urinary tract as urinary infections etc. Infections on the superficial parts of the body are called superficial infections, while the infections in deep structures like bones and joints are called deep infections. Spread of infectionInfections have survived through the passage of time by spreading from one person to another. Contrary to what people believe in, the mode of the spreading of the disease differs according to the organism and the infection that it causes. Respiratory tract infections are commonly spread through air droplets that are released when the patient coughs or sneezes. Also, if the patient sneezes to the open hand, then shakes hands with another person without washing his hand the second person can get contaminated. Organisms causing infections in our digestive system commonly enter the body through food and water that are contaminated by infected faecal matter. In addition, flies too can spread infection in the digestive system through contaminating food. There are infections which are chiefly transmitted through sexual contact. Syphillis, gonrrhoea and HIV are examples.Some other infections are spread through blood given from outside, as in unsafe transfusions, (which are extremely rare in Sri Lanka due to safety precautions) and in reusing needles contaminated with blood from an infected patient, or in healthcare setting and contaminated needle prick injuries.There are some other infections where the pathogenic organism is transferred from one person’s body to another by a vector. Dengue, which is causing much devastation in our country, and Malaria are examples.  Prevention of infectionsAs the spread of the infections is individualised to the type of infection, it stands to reason that the methods of prevention of the spread of the organisms also differ according to the infection.In preventing the spread of respiratory infections and infections like chickenpox which are spread through droplets, it’s important to avoid crowds where you can infect the others with the disease. Usually the first symptoms to appear in these infections are fever and malaise, so seeking treatment early, getting diagnosed and staying at home in order to take plenty of bed rest are advisable. Since influenza in most cases resolves on its own, adequate fluid and bed rest bring the best cure. If you have a cough or are sneezing and have to be in the presence of others, the best option is to use a face mask.  Cough etiquetteIf you do not have a facemask and have to cough or sneeze in public, you have to follow what is called the ‘Cough etiquette’. If you can, cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue paper while coughing and sneezing, in order to prevent the droplets from escaping. If you do not have a tissue or a handkerchief, use the back of your arm and not the hands to cover your face, since you can easily contaminate the surfaces that you touch after coughing by accidentally touching them with your hand. Proper hygieneMany of the digestive tract infections can be prevented by using proper water sealed toilets, and by washing and drying hands well after using the washroom. Food hygiene is crucial in preventing digestive tract infections. Well cooked, home prepared meals are ideal. Even though salads are good for your health, you have to make sure to clean the raw vegetables thoroughly before preparing salads, especially during the rainy season where the vegetables can be easily contaminated by the flood of dirty water. Keeping the food covered at all times while preparing also will help prevent the contamination of food. Hands are a major tool that spread infection; therefore hand washing before preparation as well as consumption of meals is important. RefrigerationIf the food will not be consumed soon after preparation, it is advisable to store them in a refrigerator at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, since in warm countries like Sri Lanka, bacteria can multiply quickly and spoil food. Food can be reheated before they are consumed, but reheating more than once is not recommended. Alternatively, food can be refrigerated and stored in small containers as single helpings, so there is no need of reheating.Raw food and cooked food should not be shelved near one another because the raw food can contaminate the solid food. MosquitoesIn order to prevent vector borne infections like dengue, prevention of the spread of the vector is important. Checking for places where water gets collected in your surroundings and inside your house and destroying them will prevent the growth of mosquitoes through destroyal of their breeding places. While mosquito repellents might help in keeping the vector away, mosquito nets are of not much practical use especially when it comes to Dengue, since the mosquito carrying the dengue virus usually bites humans during day time.  In the hospitalHospitals are grounds which have a higher risk of giving you an infection, especially because hospitals contain many patients with a variety of infections. Therefore, don’t bring young children and immune-compromised people to hospitals unless absolutely necessary. Minimising the contact of the surfaces and objects in the hospital and washing hands soon after returning from the hospital is recommended. Blood borne infections spread through transfused blood is extremely rare now due to the vigorous screening process of donated blood before transfusing. If you have had an accidental injury from a used needle, or have had high risk sexual behaviours in the past, seeking medical advise immediately is recommended. VaccinationImmunization of children from a younger age has helped Sri Lanka prevent many vaccine preventable infections and position us among the developing countries with the best health indicators. Therefore, the timely vaccination of your child is highly recommended. In addition, there are some vaccines available in the private sector like the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine, especially for people who have low immune systems."

Hence an evil system has been created. - Professor Harendra De Silva	There are many different institutions including orphanages run by the private sector	In 2017 we handed over 279 children back to their guardians	Limitations in adapting the foster care systemEvery child born to this world has a mother and a father. But not every mother and father will be ready to accept their child. Hence, the possibilities are such that a child could be abandoned for the rest of its life, sometimes at a tender age. This is why stories featuring two to three- week-old infants abandoned by the roadside are occasionally reported. While every child needs parental care and affection; in certain instances parents are not ready to give the necessary care due to various reasons. Most children never get to see their parents while some others are taken away when they are in their teens. In Sri Lanka, care homes or orphanages are actual homes to many children who are abandoned or neglected by their parents. They are brought up from the day they reach these homes, but after they reach 18 years of age, they are expected to be independent. However, many among them aren’t ready to face the society yet and often become victims again. With no support, money and guidance they are often led on to the wrong paths. Who needs to be responsible for them after they leave the places which provide them with care? Whether they are safe and what they would do afterwards are few of the many questions that begs answers.In such a backdrop, the Daily mirror  spoke to a few care leavers who related their rather heartening stories and also spoke to experts to find out what is being done and what needs to be done for the betterment of these youth.Stranded in societyOnce a child reaches its adolescent years, he or she has to leave these orphanages as per the law of the country. But the Daily mirror learned that in most instances such children are asked to leave by the age of 16 if they fail their O/L examination. The plight of care leavers is such that they are being brought up from a young age within a care home and provided with all facilities. But once they are asked to leave, most of them are not ready to face society yet. They feel stranded and become victims again. Due to the stigma associated with them, they are often misled and are provoked to take wrong turns in life. Hence girls have a tendency to end-up at a spa or a massage parlour while boys are taken to do odd jobs such as carpentry or domestic work in houses. Care leavers don’t have a valid birth certificate nor an identity card. Their addresses are usually that of their orphanage and since they don’t have a permanent address on their ID they are deprived of their basic right to vote. Amidst such a backdrop there are a few who are striving to do well in life and are hoping for a brighter future. The Daily mirror  spoke to a few of them;The plight of Dinushka*Dinushka doesn’t have both her parents and was sent to Colombo after she sat for her Ordinary Level Exam (O/Ls) in 2009. Although she has been married for five years her journey so far has had more downs than ups. “I was enrolled for a training course and sent to Colombo. I did everything on my own. I wasn’t prepared to do a job and I was financially handicapped. So I had to do a job. I was reluctant to speak to strangers, but I gained confidence. There was nobody to advise us on what we should do after we leave our homes. I remember once when I was admitted to hospital to undergo surgery I had no one beside me. It was then that I realised why everybody needs a mother in life. My husband also doesn’t have anybody and he wasn’t allowed to come inside the hospital. There is only one name in my birth certificate and the same appears in my ID as well. I don’t have a right to vote since my ID has the address of the orphanage I stayed in,” she said.A call to empower care leavers*Natasha was left at the orphanage when she was just three weeks old. “I have two brothers and a sister who were also at the orphanage. At one point my mother took me home along with my siblings, but I went through a rather traumatising experience. She beat me up and home was like hell to me. My mother didn’t take care of me at all and I had to do everything by myself. After I finished my O/Ls she attempted to force me into a marriage for money, but I escaped. I wanted to return to the home, but the authorities there didn’t allow me in since I was already 16. Thereafter I got myself enrolled at an institute offering a one year dental surgery course. There were many children from other homes working with me and we were all sent to Colombo. But we didn’t know the whereabouts and with no money in hand we were stranded. We didn’t know which bus to take and therefore walked on the streets till midnight on several occasions. We were reluctant to speak to people because they were waiting to take advantage of us. I then stayed with a relation of mine and learned to commute within Colombo. I left my family four years ago and now live alone. I was told that my birth certificate was a fake, and since there are two dates on my birth certificate and ID I still don’t know my actual age or birthday. Therefore I cannot open a bank account nor vote. The homes aren’t interested in finding out what happens to us after we leave especially in the case of girls. People are of the view that we don’t need money since we are from orphanages. The stigma we face is such that my friends have sometimes thought of taking their own lives. When I used to work I often heard the phrase ‘mung anatha nivase ewung’ (they are from orphanages) and similar derogatory remarks. It would be better if the Government could implement a plan to empower care leavers as we see it as a basic right which has been taken away from us,” she said.The term ‘anatha madama’ isn’t accurate*Ramya was left at an orphanage when she was eight-months-old. Her story is an example of how care leavers are stigmatised in society. “After I completed my Advanced Level Exam (A/Ls) I started working at a communication centre. After sometime the owner sold it to another person and he took advantage of me. He promised to send me reloads and give money for food and transport. But after a while he demanded a huge amount of money from me. So I had to spend all my savings to cover up the debt. Likewise I have faced many challenges in life. The term ‘anatha madama’ is not accurate; it is actually our home. When people realise that we don’t have parents they treat us like animals. We are labelled in society and it puts us under huge stress. We don’t have money in our bank accounts and because we are being treated in this way, we too look at society with anger. Therefore I make a humble request to everybody to accept us for who we are and allow us to lead a normal life like everybody else,” she said.Seeing opportunities through mediaI knew how people looked at us. I went to four schools and viewed society with much hatred*Nimmi was sent to an orphanage when she was 10-years-old. “We had to wear uniform. From those days I knew how people looked at us. I went to four schools and viewed society with much hatred. I used to wonder why all this happened to me and those around me. I then had to appear in courts and even the day before my O/Ls I had a hearing. I failed my O/Ls in the first attempt and I thought I should pass. I stayed at the home for an additional year and passed the exam. Although I did A/Ls I couldn’t do the subject of my choice. I wanted to study music, but I didn’t get a popular school. I then wanted to study law, but then again I thought it wouldn’t be the best bet for me. Thereafter I got in to writing and eventually was interested in media. I was lucky enough to do a course in journalism in India. I write a lot during my free time and I thought the media is the best way to stand up for our own rights and spread awareness about it. I stay at the Sarvodaya hostel. I can’t stay at a rented place because I have no money. I like to study further, but I don’t have the support nor money. When we leave the homes we don’t have a right to choose the job we like. We are just put into anything that is available, so we have to continue whether we like it or not,” she said.Facing pregnancy aloneSumudu was left at an orphanage when she was two-months-old. “After I did my A/Ls I was handed over to my mother, but I didn’t want to go. I then did a course in nursing and it was quite challenging with night shifts etc. I later came to Colombo, but didn’t have lodging. I didn’t have cash to pay the boarding fees. In the meantime I contracted dengue and I didn’t have anybody to look after me. Without parents we don’t know how to proceed in life in certain instances. For example if a girl becomes pregnant she would need her mother by her side, but in our case we have nobody. The Government needs to have a plan for those who leave orphanages; at least a plan to reconnect them with their biological parents. To date I haven’t shown my birth certificate to anyone. The ID too doesn’t have a permanent address and it’s a challenge to live with fake documents. Therefore we urge the authorities to come up with a plan for the betterment of care leavers,” she said.They are now employed at a church and are advocating for change through the Voice for Voiceless Foundation.*The true names of the interviewees have been withheld under strict condition of anonymityMapping out their futureIn her comments, Western Province Commissioner for Probation and Childcare Chandima Dissanayake said that once the children reach the age of 16 they are returned to their biological parents. “But there are instances when we cannot send them back to their homes because there have been instances when they have been raped by family members. During such instances we send them for a training course or a job and also provide accommodation. If they like to marry we allow them to proceed with their consent. In 2017 we handed over 279 children back to their guardians and these included children under 18 as well. We have also sent 15 of them for vocational training and 38 were permanently employed. If the youth are sitting for their A/Ls after they reach 18 years, they are allowed to stay at their homes and complete the exam. We don’t simply allow them to leave the orphanages because we know that they have reached an age where they are quite mischievous and stubborn,” said Dissanayake.When asked about the issue of permanent residence on IDs, she said that it depended on the way in which the form was filled. “If they just include the number and the address of the place without mentioning the name of the children’s home it will not be an issue. But in the case of a child from a certified school, if he or she doesn’t have parents then we have to include that the child is from a certified school. We also send the youth to do jobs depending on the court order. We also support unmarried girls and boys and give them food and accommodation and allow them to take up whatever job they like. When I took office there was no plan for care leavers in the Western Province, but I’m happy to say that we have already implemented an effective plan afterwards,” added Dissanayake.Foster care system the way forwardSpeaking to the Daily mirror , founder Chairman of National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), activist and legislator in child protection Professor Harendra De Silva said that institutional care isn’t the best for a child. “There are many different institutions including orphanages run by the private sector which are usually funded by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In addition to that there are state-run orphanages and institutions such as certified, demand and detention homes. Children in detention homes are above five years of age whose actions have been in conflict with the law. They may be found guilty of stealing two coconuts or for jumping over a fence to a neighbouring land etc., and therefore will have to face a jail term. Some of these children have been abandoned while the others are street children. While within these institutions they have a greater tendency to experience sexual and other forms of abuse. There have been so many such incidents in the past. There’s a huge amount of emotional abuse experienced by these children which cannot even be defined. When I was NCPA Chairman each child received Rs. 21 per day for food and other expenses and orphanages and care homes relied on alms givings and other donations in kind. However there is open mismanagement of funds and resources by the staff,” said Prof. De Silva.“In most instances orphanages ask for money and dry rations. But that is not what the children want. They would want a toy or a favourite food. Hence an evil system has been created. We aren’t trying to empower the children, but wish to enhance their self-respect. Western countries have adopted the foster care parent system which is a cheaper approach for the government as well. Here, each foster parent is given a certain amount of money to take care of the child. But the only issue here is that these foster parents should be screened because in certain instances these foster parents could be abusers or they may use children for domestic work. Hence we should establish a proper screening system for foster parents by seeking support from qualified psychologists and social workers. We are experts at showing off people who appear to be pseudo-experts and they flood the market. They appear with fake certificates and claim to be proper counsellors,” warned Prof. De Silva.Prof. De Silva further said that Sri Lanka also doesn’t have a proper monitoring system. “Once a child is in foster care there should be people who must monitor and evaluate the progress of the child. They should be able to go to school and monitor the performance, check for absenteeism and observe how the child is being treated at home. Foster parents may look at legal methods to adopt a child servant and such moves should be discouraged.During a screening the child’s health and nutritional status should also be monitored and evaluated. Another way of foster care is where the child lives with his or her biological parents, but another foster family could support them with money and resources. A few limitations of this process would be that it has to be handled by someone who knows the subject.The Government doesn’t have as many professionals from the perspective of administration.They work according to regulations and circulars and therefore things don’t happen as planned. We need good professionals who are committed to the subject and they should decide on the standards of procedures. We can seek support from Grama Niladhari and Samurdhi officers who could be trained to go from house to house to monitor the foster care process.There are probation officers in the country, but they have been appointed for political purposes.They would obey an order from the top, but will not work for the best interest of the children. In addition to that we could identify dysfunctional families and provide them with supplements. Hence there has to be a paradigm shift in the way of thinking. There’s politics everywhere, but somebody has to take a decision and this responsibility is vested upon the leadership,” he opined.Generation Never Give Up‘Generation Never Give Up’ is a platform that has been established to empower youth leaving residential care in order to create a generation that will never give up. Therefore it aims to create a safe and inclusive society, for youth leaving residential care before or after the age of 18 with the support of state and non-state stakeholders. Services provided under this platform include job opportunities and career guidance, scholarships for higher education, psychological counselling, legal support, peer support, an emergency hotline and an information database.For further details visit www.gnglk.org"

"National Dengue Prevention Week: Don’t let dengue mosquitoes sting us","2018-09-29 01:15:54							0						 				1282"," The dengue pandemic is once again trying to penetrate our nation. However, ‘The National Dengue Prevention Week’ campaign which commenced on September 26 is doing its utmost to eradicate and prevent the virus in Sri Lanka. The dengue prevention campaign is carried out jointly by the CMC, Health Ministry, Special Presidential Task Force, the Environment Police and the Tri-Forces.   Consultant Community Physician of the National Dengue Control Unit, Dr. Preshila Samaraweera, spoke about the dengue prevention week, and the programmes which are conducted throughout the week, “We conduct two national dengue control weeks every year. Usually it is conducted just before the monsoon period. When we see the pattern of dengue of patients throughout the year, there is a seasonal peak from May to July and October to January. The seasonal peak typically coincides with the South Western monsoon and the North Eastern monsoon.   We conduct our sessions in various health divisions in our country which are called MOH areas (medical officer of health division). We have 355 MOHs in Sri Lanka. We categorize those MOH areas into three considering the density and probability of dengue in that region. The categories are: priority high risk, high risk and low risk. We have had 50 priority high risk MOH areas and 125 high risk areas. The other areas are low risk. During the week we conduct programmes in the priority high risk areas on all 7 days, and 5 days for the high risk areas. During this week we get the support from the tri-forces and the police to conduct the sessions. Such personnel are allocated into teams of three. Further within the MOH areas, we select high risk grama niladari divisions. Usually a grama niladari division consists of 500-700 houses. Each team is responsible for getting the cleaning of potential breeding cleared by respective households. The teams must visit and inspect every house, institute, school, constructive site hence any potential breeding places. Post inspection they ask people to remove unwanted water holding containers that promote breeding. The teams also educate the people of the area and help them identify breeding places. The respective PHI (public health officer) will inform the Grama niladari and religious leaders in order to have shramadanas to clean the areas.”    We conduct our sessions in various health divisions in our country which are called MOH areas (medical officer of health division). We have 355 MOHs in Sri Lanka She noted that on September 28 that they have selected schools to be inspected. The education ministry has issued a circular to inspect and have a shramadana campaign in all the schools of the country. But the priority high risk area schools are inspected and cleaned with more attentiveness.   She elaborated on the status of dengue in our country in contrast to the preceding years, she said, “dengue has reduced significantly, from 150,000 (January- September 2017) to 38000 cases this year ( January- September 2018).    Many factors have contributed to this reduction. When there is a large outbreak, the trend is normally that the following years will have a reduction in cases, because many people got the disease previous year. Every 5- 6 years we have a cyclical outbreak, due to zero type change. This is because the dengue virus has 4 types. For instance when we get an infection from the type 1 virus, we would not get the type 1 virus again. But, if a person, who has already contracted the type 1 virus and is later exposed to the type-2 virus they can contract the disease again. The significance of last year was that after 9 years the type 2 virus re-entered our country. Many people have not got exposed the type-2 virus, hence this facilitated the dengue outbreak last year.”   She also said that the reduction in cases is attributed to the actions taken by the health ministry, as they have allocated 1500 labourers this year to control the breeding of mosquitos and to carry out daily inspections of specified areas. Hence, every day waste such as coconut shells, salmon tins, buckets, tyres and empty containers are cleared by such personnel. Therefore, the number of breeding places in the country would reduce.   She spoke about the dengue vaccine that was much discussed about in the previous years, “ one of the vaccines is still under trial within our own country. There is another vaccine but the advisory commission has not accepted it in our country, because there is an issue in the Philippines regarding that vaccine.”   Speaking of dengue management in hospitals in our country she said, “Usually in our country the fatality rate of dengue is very low, last year we had 186 000 dengue patients but 440 deaths. In our country we are managing dengue patients very well. It is up to the standard of other countries such as Singapore and Thailand. Such dengue riddled countries have got together and follow a similar dengue management guideline and treatment techniques. There is no specific drug however to cure dengue yet.”   In her concluding remarks she said, “ In order to efficiently manage the dengue menance we must change the behaviour of the people in our country. We have to inculcate the behaviour of disposing waste. Then only can we substantially reduce dengue in Sri Lanka. To change this behavior and the culture of our people is a major challenge we face. We do many programmes with the education ministry to educate and spread awareness to children of proper waste management practices. We want waste management to become a natural habit. Further, clearing waste should be done on a daily basis and not only when an outbreak occurs. For instance, Some homes are quite vigilant when an outbreak occurs, but afterwards they begin to neglect waste in their homes. Therefore, the key to prevention of the epidemic is through environmental management. Some homes have bird baths, ponds and stagnant water in gutters that are heavily polluted. There must be a mechanisms to maintain them. As a further prevention mechanism chemicals are being used to destroy larvae and fogging is done to kill adult mosquitoes. However, we are trying to use chemicals at a minimum because such chemicals can cause resistance and it can also cause other diseases in people.”   "
"Knowing your blood report","2018-09-26 09:59:26							0						 				404","Blood tests have become such an integral part of disease diagnosis and treatment process that when you go to a doctor, more often than not, you are asked to obtain a blood report related to your condition. That’s why we decided to bring you a series of articles to provide information regarding blood tests; ordered commonly. Dr. K.A.C. Wickramaratne, Consultant Haematologist, Senior Lecturer in Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ruhuna, answers our queries in this week’s edition of Health Capsule with regard to blood tests.   “I strongly recommend the interpretation of any laboratory test to be done by the requesting clinician”, stresses Dr. Wickramartne. He explains that this process should be followed because despite the findings can be considered normal it can sometimes be a clue to a disease. Therefore, getting test reports interpreted by any person other than the one who requested it is of serious concern and should be avoided for the safety of the patients. Also, each laboratory test should ideally be requested by a doctor following a thorough history and a physical examination of the patient, so that only the relevant lab tests are requested. A Full Blood Count, the most commonly requested haematology test globally, is the topic discussed in this week’s edition of Health Capsule.   What is FBC?Full Blood Count (FBC) or Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a very useful test for the diagnosis of diverse conditions. Full or complete is a relative term as newer machines come with more and more added parameters with unique advantages in diagnosis. Even though it bears simple three letters FBC, it is a battery of tests with diverse information of blood cells. Nowadays, the test is done using fully automated analyzers.To understand what FBC is, we should know first what is analysed in this test. Blood can be separated into a liquid part plasma and solid – formed elements cells. FBC analyzes these cells.   Red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes) are analyzed in machines mainly to show how much of these cells are present per unit volume of blood. In addition, it gives some qualitative parametres such as changes in cell size, presence of abnormal cells, and presence of young or immature cells and even predicts the possibility of presence of some unique diseases such as Dengue fever in some cases.   How do I prepare for a FBC?A blood sample for a FBC can be given at any time of the day. It is collected as a random sample. However, early morning is ideal for any test. But changes throughout the day are subtle and are therefore of no concern. However, physical exertion, some drugs (such as prednisolone), smoking etc can affect FBC results, so are worth notifying your doctor when he is interpreting the results. It is better to give the sample after about 20 min rest if you were walking briskly.   Blood collection is best performed without a tourniquet. If a tourniquet is applied it should be applied immediately before venipuncture and removed within a minute. Blood from a vein, rather than from an artery is taken, as is the case with many tests. The sample will be perfect if venipuncture is neat, if the blood is drawn in to a syringe without much effort and without any bubbles, if the correct volume is filled into the tube; where a special agent to keep the blood from clotting, is pre-added, and mixed gently by 5-6 inversions. Samples, when transported and stored at temperatures between 21 – 27 0 C, can be analysed even after 48 hours to obtain accurate FBC results.   What is the information that can be garnered from a FBC?Results of the lab test and clinical manifestations of the disease should always be analysed together.Red cell parametresThese include Haemoglobin concentration (Hb - amount of oxygen carrying pigment) and red cell count (RBC or RCC) per unit volume of blood and haematocrit (HCT) or packed red cell volume (PCV) a measure of total red cell volume per unit volume of blood as a percentage].Normal values (or more accurately the reference values) of these parametres vary between different age groups, sexes and during certain physiological states such as pregnancy. So it should be interpreted with correct reference range for age, sex and physiological status. Higher values than upper limit is called polycythemia. It is a group of disorders needing further investigations. Values below the lower limit is called anaemia. It is a manifestation of a disease, thus should be investigated. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measure of red cell size and it is very important to understand the type of anaemia. When it is high it can be vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. When it is low it can be iron deficiency or thalassaemia. Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH) is a measure of Hb content in red cells and lower values can be indicative of iron deficiency or thalassaemia.These are only a few examples of the vast amount of information that can be collected from red cell parameters.White blood cell parametersThese include total white cell count (WBC) per unit volume of blood and absolute and relative percentages of each white cell subtype [we call it differential count (DC)]. Higher or lower total number of white cells and changes in DC can indicate infections or even serious diseases such as blood cancer. The variations in DC could be indicative of simple viral infection or bacterial infections such as leptospirosis, pneumonia or urine infection. Even allergic conditions, parasitic diseases such as filariasis, can subject DC to unique changes.The WBC count and DC can change with physical exertion, smoking or some drugs such as prednisolone. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when interpreting WBC parameters as well.   Platelets   Platelets are needed for stoppage of bleeding when we have wounds. The number of platelets per unit volume of blood is platelet count. Lower and higher values indicate diseases and can endanger life by spontaneous bleeding within the body or by “clot” formation in brain etc respectively. Platelet parametres available in automated FBC give clues on progression of platelet disorders.   Can we compare FBC results of different laboratories?The comparison of results between different laboratories cannot be done and should be discouraged unless the laboratories use similar machines and similar procedures. We call it standardisation and is yet to be established in Sri Lanka. When monitoring of FBC is needed with regard to a patient, it has to be done from the same laboratory throughout the monitoring process. Looking for any accreditation status ISO 15189 or CAP would give additional security or trust on quality or the reliability of what you receive as the FBC report. The presence of consultants to supervise and presence of qualified MLTs in a medical clinical laboratory is very important.Is it good to get FBC done as a routine on our own?As we have previously mentioned, any test when requested, should have a purpose and should be interpreted by a qualified doctor.   It has to be linked with symptoms, signs, age, sex, physiological status etc.  Just reading counts and comparing it with references given is inadequate and can mislead. This can happen when patients try to get reports interpreted by laboratory personnel or blood collection officials (phlebotomists). In a laboratory haematologists or pathologists, doctors or consultants related to laboratory medicine with relevant training can interpret FBC parameters. Other laboratory personnel are not qualified and competent to interpret these within the clinical context.  Unless clinician recommends and educates you to monitor your counts, obtaining random counts and getting them interpreted by an unqualified person is therefore inadvisable.   Can FBC results be erroneous?Yes. In any part of the world even with strict quality control, random errors are possible, but rare. Accredited laboratories try to control all potential errors. Most of the errors associated with FBC are due to errors in the sample collection and processing before analysis. If we elaborate a little on this, a traumatic venipuncture, froth formation (air bubbling inside syringe), pushing blood into the tube through a needle, vigorous shaking of tube with blood, exposure of blood to very high temperatures and marked delays in analysis all can affect FBC parameters adversely. Frequently falsely low platelets counts are seen due to these errors.   To generate accurate results, all the FBC machines should be properly installed, calibrated and maintained as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality control should be available for daily runs as well as external quality assurance at regular intervals. The availability of external and internal quality is not sufficient unless they monitor, review and act on results of quality control. Qualified, trained and competent laboratory personnel are therefore mandatory.  As for the possibility of a laboratory to perform any other test from the same sample, the answer would be ‘yes’. Commonly a sample collected for FBC can be used to perform blood picture, ESR, malaria or any other blood parasites examination, HbA1c (a test useful to monitor diabetes), blood grouping, reticulocyte count and Hb electrophoresis etc.   In a nutshell, FBC is a battery of investigations giving clues on how healthy your blood cells are. When used wisely it gives a large amount of information for the clinician for proper diagnosis and care. Quality of FBC results depend on many factors and collection errors are the most important. Remember not to rely on ‘interpreters’ of FBC (or any other test report) for your health. It should be done by a qualified doctor. When you select a laboratory for FBC (or any other test) accreditation status, presence of qualified team including presence of Haematologists to supervise are good points to remember.  "

"POLITICAL CIRCUS HITS TOWN Leaders in suites, drunken supporters fallen on streets","2018-09-11 00:10:07							0						 				1400","  	Thousands want to see there is quick action to punish the corrupt	This was an election promise that has to be kept at all costs, whatever the circumstances may be It was a circus all right, acrobats, jugglers and jumpers galore, while mothers were afraid to send their children to school, workers stayed away from their workplaces, some offices closed early. The organisers of the protest were unconcerned about the loss to children of education, loss to the economy by offices being closed.Their only focus was on themselves and getting back to the grandeur of power. Far from bringing the government down, many JO supporters were seen fallen in drunken stupors, lying on streets, some rescued by the ambulances introduced with the help of India by this government and hospitalized. One man died later of a heart attack. It was good to see few women among the supporters transported to Colombo who was gifted with packets of Chicken Biriyani, packets of cigarettes and arrack.It showed that the female of the species is wiser and far harder to fool than the male!Their promise to bring 200,000 supporters was just their usual boastful talk, they could only muster about 20,000 supporters.Namal Rajapaksa and Dilan Perera have never been famed as mental heavyweights, so their ridiculous statements after the circus was over, far ahead of the break of dawn, should not be taken seriously. The tax authorities should question the sourcing of the funds used for this and where they came from.One wonders why there were no verbal attacks on this charade of a protest and the inconvenience caused to the public, by those three prosperous, well-fed businessmen, robber barons as they were named in the media, who vented their wrath and fury against the Government, in no uncertain terms at a fireside chat recently. Namal Rajapaksa and Dilan Perera have never been famed as mental heavyweights, so their ridiculous statements after the circus was over, far ahead of the break of dawn, should not be taken seriously. The tax authorities should question the sourcing of the funds used for this and where they came fromOne of them openly called for a dictatorship. His benefits from dictators earlier on are no secret. Do they condone the white vans, abductions, murders and the rampant unprecedented level of corruption in the Rajapaksa regime?Another bemoaned the fact that government servants were given an increase in salaries while businessmen were taxed to the hilt.Still, another spoke about takeovers which had been done by the previous government but gave the impression that it was the fault of the present one.Perhaps age has dimmed his brain. It seems a pity that their wisdom hasn’t increased along with their bank balances. There are none so blind that those who will not see! I must commend the comments by Dhammika Perera and Merrill J Fernando in this context. I would like to know from the first three I mentioned whether they would have dared to hurl these attacks at the time the Rajapaksa family were ruling the country. I dread to think of what their fate would have been.They are going far beyond the peripheries of freedom, now in existence and abusing it like some in the media do too.The previous government did not focus on education; perhaps as many of them are uneducated, they value brawn more than the development of the brain. This government has increased the Mahapola allowance to Rs 4,000/-, given laptops to schoolchildren, built new buildings for 9,000 schools all over the country, given insurance to schoolchildren.So much investment has been to ensure an educated future generation which can take the country forward with the desired intellectual ability to do so. There have been over 137 housing projects launched under the leadership of Sajith Premadasa by this government.The fact that the government allowed the protest is again, a tribute to the freedom and democracy that exists today. This in sharp contrast to the protest during the Rajapaksa regime at Rathupaswala, in which several protestors were killed.The citizens of Colombo followed the lead of the government led by the President and the Prime Minister in ignoring the protest, no cheering squads form Colombo lined the roads.Lands are continuing to be returned to rightful owners in the North and in the South too, this is being done to those who lost theirs through the injustice of one kind or another. The fact that the government allowed the protest is again, a tribute to the freedom and democracy that exists today. This in sharp contrast to the protest during the Rajapaksa regime at Rathupaswala, in which several protestors were killedThere has been a vast creation of employment, prices of medicines reduced, salaries increased. The percentage of those affected by dengue in Colombo has dropped by 64% in comparison with 2017. There is no vulgar extravagance in public spending. No VIP of the government has used public funds for memorials for their families. VIP’s wives and sons do not fly to N’Eliya for baths or to ride their horses.To my mind, what thousands of others including me want to see, is that there is quick action to punish the corrupt in the former regimeand in this too if they are guilty of corruption.That is my grouse. Slow action in that respect. This was an election promise that has to be kept at all costs, whatever the circumstances may be. We also have Nihal of CJC fame jumping in like a Bull in a China Shop to give his professorial bill a hand, in stating that there was no impediment in the pseudo-Emperor contesting the Presidency again.The latter has unfortunately not changed his clothes, literally or metaphorically and Nihal may find that visions of CJC become more than a blast from the past in the minds of the people.Political Leaders must act like Statesman with dignity and fortitude through all seasons, “..meet with both triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same.”The Prime Minister has been the epitome of this throughout his political life, a worthy example to the second string of young leaders he has groomed in the UNP."
"Sri Lanka Police celebrates 152 years today: A dignified and enduring mission","2018-09-03 00:05:06							0						 				1564"," On this day, the 152nd Police Day is celebrated, under the theme, A Dignified Enduring Mission with the objective of making Sri Lanka Police, which closely associated with Sri Lankan community for a period of 152 years, the bosom companion of the public with the help of community policing concept.ature has endowed the human beings with a higher cognitive capacity, which surpasses that of all other living beings, probably as a means of ensuring the existence of the world.Thus, we are born into this world and lead our lives as social beings. Concerning our lifespan from womb to tomb, and even further in case of illegitimate conceptions or illegal exhumations, Sri Lanka Police is entrusted with the bounden duty of shouldering the constitutional responsibility and ensuring the safety of the general public of our motherland.Adopting the Buddhist words of wisdom, “Dhammo hawe rakkhathi  dhammachari” (One who lives with the Dhamma is protected by the Dhamma) as its motto, while wearing the emblem bearing a dauntless tusker in the middle and the dharma chakra (Dharma Wheel) on the head, Sri Lanka Police is dedicated towards maintaining law and order while safeguarding lives and property of all Sri Lankans.This is considered to be one of the major organizations among the three State institutions, which were initially established in this country and its glorious history and the 152nd anniversary is thus celebrated with great vim and gusto.Sri Lanka Police also marks the inception of the first security service in Sri Lanka. The history of the security service of this country goes back to the reign of King Pandukabhaya and this service owes its origin to the position named, Nagara Guththika. It has gradually evolved up to the Dutch and Portuguese eras. After occupying the maritime areas of the country in 1796, the British established a Police Service in this country.The Police Force was further streamlined under the regulations imposed by the Act bearing No. 14 passed under the British Crown in 1806 and at the time the Police Force consisted of 28 Police Force Constables. ""This is considered to be one of the major organizations among the three State institutions, which were initially established in this country and its glorious history and the 152nd anniversary is thus celebrated with great vim and gusto""Payment of salaries to the Police Force was made with effect from July 9, 1833. Then, 47 Police Stations were established centred on commercial cities and 585 Police Officers were deployed for city protection duties.The Maradana Police Station was recorded in history as the First Police Station to be established in this manner.With the appointment of Mr George William Robinson Campbell as the first Inspector General of Police on September 3, 1966, as per the provisions of the Police Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, the inauguration of the Police Service as an organization in this country took place Constitutionally.The said date has been declared as the Police Day. Since the appointment of Sir Richard Aluvihare on January 6, 1947, as the first Sri Lankan Inspector General of Police, the occidental aura emanated from the Police Service has begun to be overpowered by the Sri Lankan spirit.At present, Sri Lanka Police functions under the Ministry of Public Administration and Law & Order and has become a solid Government institution, which consists of 64 Functional Divisions, 42 Territorial Divisions, 491 Police Stations with a strength of more than 90,000 Police Officers.The term ‘Polis’ has been derived from the French language and it means, ‘The guardian of the civil administration’.There is no other public institution than Police organization, which faces greater challenges in a country, where the civil administration is in effect due to the absence of internal disputes.The Sri Lanka Police, which has encountered three internal civil disputes, has faced many daunting challenges subsequent to the war situation prevailed for three decades in North Eastern Provinces.The duties of a Police organization in other countries are investigation of crimes, crime prevention, maintenance of law and order and traffic management.However, the professional role of a Sri Lankan Police officer is played in a more complex way.In addition to the basic police duties such as crime investigation, crime prevention, maintenance of law and order and traffic management, the citizens of the country currently expect the police to perform tasks such as implementing laws on liquor and narcotics, prevention of communicable diseases like dengue, protection of forests, coastal conservation, wildlife conservation, prevention of illegal sand mining and illegal excavation, even though there are separate Government bodies which are functioning to implement such environmental laws.At present, even the safety of the railway crossings is ensured under Police supervision. Thus, the duty of the police officer has become extremely complex. On the other hand, it brings us great pleasure to think of the sense of confidence Sri Lanka Police has inspired in the Executive, the Legislature and the general public for choosing us to assign a significant share of all these tasks.In other countries, usually, the Police officers are not assigned to other duties.However, the Sri Lankan Police are deployed for the performance of other duties and a different structure has been designed for that purpose. The officers of Sri Lanka Police are discharging those duties on a daily basis and sometimes even the officers of the Special Task Force, which is the elite paramilitary forces unit of Sri Lanka Police, might assume the role of a valiant soldier, while discharging ordinary Police duties.Sri Lanka Police that has inherited a proud history of 152 years, is offering many services covering various fields to more than twenty million Sri Lankans.Protecting lives and property of Sri Lankan citizens, Sri Lanka Police have presently become a bosom friend of the general public and it stands upright like a giant tree above a thick canopy of praise, blame, commendation and criticism while confronting all the difficulties and challenges around the clock in both sun and rain.The number of Police Stations that was 437 in 2015 have been increased up to 492 to date by the present Inspector General of Police, Mr Pujith Jayasundara, who pays special attention towards improving the basic facilities and service facilities necessary to fulfil the public needs efficiently by bridging the gap between the public and police. This provided a great relief for the people who had to travel a long way with great difficulty to get services from Police.New Police Stations have been established by further segmenting some of the larger Police Divisions. This has further reduced the population density of a respective Police Station and therefore those people have been able to get their services more efficiently.Furthermore, taking measures to develop human and physical resources in Sri Lanka Police with the intention of ensuring the security of the society in a peaceful country can be perceived as a huge achievement of the citizens of this country.This becomes evident when analyzing statistical data of 15 years in which the tendency to talk about criminal incidents have increased. Criminal incidents were also reported during the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 when compared to the present. However, since news articles on war had occupied more space on newspapers, incidents of crimes did not attract much public attention then.After 2009, headlines related to war had been replaced with headlines about criminal incidents, creating a basis for discussion. That is not a factor which should be construed as an increase in crimes. ""The number of Police Stations that was 437 in 2015 have been increased up to 492 to date by the present Inspector General of Police, Mr Pujith Jayasundara, who pays special attention towards improving the basic facilities and service facilities necessary to fulfil the public needs efficiently by bridging the gap between the public and police""Through the application of modern technology for investigating crimes, Sri Lanka Police has been able to initiate a significant development in the field of investigation.A great assistance is being given by Scene of Crime Officers (SOCO) who have undergone a proper training, officers and hounds of Police Kennels Division, Fingerprint Officers and Photographers of Police Criminal Records Division to facilitate the investigations and to identify criminals.At a time when the entire world is shrinking into a small global village, even the criminals in our country have gained access to the modern technology under globalization and show a tendency to employ modern technology and communication methods to commit crimes.Confronted with the challenge of protecting people from those who commit organized crimes, while being members of crime networks, Criminal Investigations Department is taking measures to shoulder their responsibility and all Police Stations of the Island are also extending a great support in that regard.May Sri Lanka Police endure through time executing its legendary mission!The writer is an Attorney-at-law, Police Media Spokesman and the Director and of the Police Media Division."
"To Dr. Ramya Kumar’s Article Doctors, MOH, Free Education et al","2018-08-21 00:04:05							0						 				1388","Right of ReplyRead with much interest a response to my article of July 27, 2018, in particular and to most other articles of mine on the health sector and medical profession in the DM, titled “Do away with Medical Officers of Health? A response to Kusal Perera” by Dr. Ramya Kumar, an academic in the Medical Faculty of the University of Jaffna. Appreciate very much the initiative to engage in discussion on this very vital topic that most have kept away to date.  Reading through Dr. Ramya Kumar’s response, I feel there is some misreading of what I have been arguing and making observations on, and that needs brief clarifications and explanations.  1) Dr. Kumar says in “yet another article” I have been “slamming the medical profession”, implying I have always been “slamming the medical profession”. In conclusion, Dr. Kumar says “I urge Perera to separate his contempt for the medical profession and the Government Medical Officers’ Association(GMOA) from his analysis of the public health sector…..”  I have always been holding the GMOA leadership as a “medical mafia”. I would continue to do so, until and unless the GMOA leadership changes course to play a responsible, civilized role within the health sector and in society. As for the medical profession, yes, I do say, it is no more the “noble profession” it was. As a “profession” the medical profession has over the past decades given up its moral and ethical standards and is no more different to all other corrupt professions; the legal, accounting, engineering, the academia etc. Yet I do accept there are very good medical doctors as very good lawyers, engineers, accountants, academics et al. Where I hold “good doctors” at fault is on their silence and their reluctance to stand up to the GMOA mafia. My “criticism of the medical profession and the private practise is valid” says Dr. Kumar.  2) Yet Dr. Kumar says “…his writings are confused and often unsubstantiated”. A point made is that, my “antipathy to the medical profession” led me to “undermine the students’ call to protect ‘free’ education”. I was thus supporting the government’s effort to privatize medical education says Dr. Kumar, “taking a questionable position on SAITM”.Glad Dr. Kumar raised this issue of “free education” along with “private medical education”. My position on “free education” had nothing to do with simplified sloganizing of “free education” by not only the students, but by the academics and the GMOA too. “Free education” in the anti SAITM protests was only a popular cover for the very sectarian demand by GMOA.   My position on “free education” is based on “Sessional Papers No.43 of 1944”, commonly known as “Kannangara Reforms”. Sadly, most in the “anti-SAITM” campaign did not know what this “Sessional Paper” is about and those gullible students brought on to Colombo streets have not even seen a copy of it. In June 1944, when it was adopted by the State Council, there were over 1,100 private schools managed by Missionaries and the Buddhist Theosophical Society along with State owned “government” schools. “Kannangara Reforms” never ever proposed to “nationalize” these private schools. It never proposed education “free of charge”. It allowed even government schools to levy “facilities fees”. Private schools that could not afford a well paid tutorial staff was “assisted by government”. All schools levied fees, with government schools not making it compulsory.   “Free education” was NOT “free of charge” education as these students and Dr. Kumar would want to believe.Today we have more than 44 totally private schools (including Chundikuli Girls’ School) within our national education system, even after PM Bandaranaike’s government in 1962 nationalized a vast majority of assisted and private schools. Pupils in these private schools are taught the same curriculum and the same syllabi. They sit the same G.C.E O/L and A/L exams with all other students from government schools and compete for admissions to all faculties in State universities.    Free education and private medical education issues raised as ‘matters of life and death’ have no relevance and validity in the context of present day education The call against private medical education Dr. Ramya Kumar stands with, has no validity with eight medical faculty Deans sitting in the SLMC accepting and registering private medical colleges and universities for Sri Lankan students to graduate as medical doctors with only the ERPM (another tuition industry monopolised by medical doctors) required to practise medicine and join government service. Is it where the private medical college is located that decides “privatizing of medical education”? If private medical education is opposed on principle, why wasn’t the KDA fee levying medical faculty opposed along with SAITM?  Free education and private medical education issues raised as ‘matters of life and death’ have no relevance and validity in the context of present day education where everything has been com-modified with absolutely no protests from any quarter during the last 30 years and more. Private companies own “International schools” that have yet to be opposed by this fake “Free education” campaigners. Nor do they question, the massive private tuition industry that makes a mockery of Kannangara Reforms that established a “national education system”, accepted the “right to education” with equal opportunities on a level playing field. The role of the State was to create that opportunity for the majority who could not afford such education to their children.   Let’s also not forget,those who fight to safeguard “free education” never speak nor oppose fee levying courses in their own universities and the academia that sympathized and supported student campaigns never avoided teaching in these fee levying courses for extra income. They also ignore all foreign university degrees offered and privately tutored here and professional degrees and diplomas from private institutes and organizations held valid in local employment.   There always was a market-based education sector that had expanded without limits within the ‘free market economy’ and without any opposition from “free education” campaigners.  3) The present role of the position ‘MOH’ and that of the medical doctors holding that position needs serious dialogue. Dr. Kumar’s details as to why and how the British colonial rulers came to establish a Medical Officer Health (MOH) post in preventive healthcare is accepted and is history.The 50’s and the 60’s, was when even politicians were honourable men and women unlike today. Not only the MOH, everyone else in the health service from top to bottom were duty conscious and discharged their duties honestly. The whole public sector was that then. Monitoring of field work then came under an OIC who was a Senior PHI in the MOH division. This responsibility was brought under the MOH from around 1964.  My assumption, Medical Doctors of “today” as MOH have failed miserably in their discharge of duties, with spread of Dengue used as one example is based not only on numbers I quoted, but on pathetically degenerated professionalism and politics of the GMOA that results in medical officers as MOH neglecting their duties and responsibilities. The claim by Dr. Kumar that “They oversee service delivery at the community level, including maternal and child health, family planning, and communicable and non-communicable disease prevention, while carrying out medical consultations at maternal and child health clinics” is therefore the point of contention. Except attending maternal and child health clinics, MOH is an almost absent officer in all else. They are comfortable remote controlling all monitoring work from their offices. May be Jaffna is different, as noted by Dr. Kumar.   Rapid and unplanned urbanisation mentioned as reason for recent spread of dengue, is only half true with MOH rarely seen or heard in most anti dengue campaigns carried out with police personnel, Local Government Councillors and DS office personnel. It is a fact that dengue cannot be successfully controlled without community support and participation. It is also a fact, community support and participation have to be mobilized by MOH and his staff. That is what goes missing with medical doctors as MOH. Their ego with the “tie and the stethoscope” do not allow them in the field as the PHI and the Public Family Health Officers (Mid wives) do.  True the post of MOH is no glamourous post for medical doctors. But that gives them enough time for PP in their own area, especially in rural society. And in Colombo and suburbs that provides them an added reason to demand “National schools” for their children.   As for my proposal to shift medical doctors posted as MOH to area GP work, does not in anyway reflect “Colombo dinner table talk”. That also does not replace the medical doctor with para medics in curative health. Instead it provides people with a government GP in their own area, they now have to pay for, unless they go to a government hospital, where the OPD often doesn’t run for more than three hours a day. Well trained para-medics for community preventive healthcare, is one I borrowed from J.H.L Cumpston (Director General, Health Services of Australia) who was commissioned by then Ceylon government and whose Report in 1950 explains the rational for it. Yet it was only a proposal, and is open for dialogue, without doubt."
"New acquisitions weigh on Hemas 1Q bottom line","2018-08-16 00:02:20							0						 				1121","The recent new acquisitions weighed on the bottom line of the diversified conglomerate Hemas PLC during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 (1Q19), the interim financial accounts released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.The earnings for the quarter under review fell 20.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.554.3 million, on revenue of Rs.13.5 billion, up 21.3 percent YoY.The earnings per share for the period fell to 96 cents, from Rs.1.21.Hemas Group CEO Steven Enderby said the reduced interest income due to the utilization of cash reserves to acquire Atlas Axillia was a key reason for the reduction in earnings during the quarter.The finance income for the quarter under review fell 57 percent YoY to Rs.95.4 million.He also identified higher interest costs relating to higher working capital due to the strong growth in pharmaceutical distribution and loan financing for the group’s new logistics park as another key reason that hampered the group bottom line. The finance costs for the period rose 66 percent YoY to Rs.119.21 million. “All three of these investments should contribute to earnings from 3Q,” Enderby said.The group operating profit for the quarter under review grew only by 3.5 percent YoY to Rs.895.7 million.“The operating profit growth has been impacted by losses at N*Able, our IT technology solutions business, coupled with a weaker macroeconomic environment with sluggish consumer demand as disposable incomes have been dampened by the rising costs from rupee depreciation and increased taxes,” Enderby said.The group’s consumer business revenue stood at Rs.5.4 billion for period under review, up 36.2 percent YoY. The growth in the consumer sector, excluding Atlas, stands at 6.8 percent. The operating profit of the segment grew 8.1 percent YoY Rs.569.3 million.Hemas said during the quarter under review, the market conditions domestically remain depressed with most market commentaries indicating low or negative growth in most major FMCG categories.The group’s Bangladesh business experienced revenue growth of 6.1 percent, following the Kumarika relaunch last December. However, Enderby said profitability still remains a challenge due to the heavy marketing spend post-launch. The group said Atlas performance has been on track in 1Q with revenues up by 8.8 percent over last year and break even in operating profits in line with its normal seasonal performance trend.The revenue of the group’s healthcare segment rose 24.7 percent YoY to Rs.6.4 billion but the operating profit fell 2 percent YoY to Rs.498.8 million. Hemas said the price regulations brought in for certain pharmaceutical drugs and depreciation of the rupee against the dollar was a major operational challenge it had to face during the quarter under review.The hospitals run by Hemas saw 60 percent occupancy during the period but the revenues and profitability were flat compared to the same quarter, last year, when the occupancy levels were higher due to the dengue epidemic. The group’s pharmaceutical manufacturing and marketing subsidiary Morison posted revenue of Rs.844.3 million and operating profit of Rs.83 million for the quarter under review. Meanwhile, Hemas leisure, travel and aviation business recorded total revenue of Rs.792.4 million reflecting a growth of 16.2 percent for the three months under consideration. The segment was also able to narrow its operating loss to Rs.68.1 million, from Rs.127.6 million a year ago.The group’s logistics and maritime business recorded a revenue growth of 15.4 percent YoY to Rs.718.3 million. The operating profit improved to Rs.216.6 million, from Rs.188 million a year ago.During this period, the Colombo port witnessed a YoY growth of 15 percent.The Esufally family has a 61 percent stake in Hemas through various investment vehicles, while Norges Bank, Norway’s giant wealth fund operating under its Central Bank, has a 2.99 percent stake in the company.Franklin Templeton Fund also has a 9.7 percent stake in Hemas.During 1Q19, the two new entrants to the top 20 shareholders of Hemas were Phoenix Venture (Pvt.) Ltd with a one percent stake and Kopernik Global All Cap fund with 0.69 percent.  "
"Right of reply Do away with Medical Officers of Health? A response to Kusal Perera","2018-08-16 00:00:01							0						 				1670","Two weeks ago, the , on July 27, 2018, carried yet another article by Kusal Perera slamming the medical profession. In this piece, Perera argues that increasing the number of medical doctors by establishing new state medical faculties will be useless because the doctors they produce will occupy redundant administrative positions in the public sector. Perera attributes “the continuing decline in the health service” to medical doctors holding administrative positions like the Medical Officer of Health (MOH), a position that he suggests should be done away with, and be replaced by trained paramedical workers.    	The MOH is not a glamorous position in the medical hierarchy which places hospital-based specialists at the apex	 	I have met a number of dynamic MOHs working tirelessly with limited resources While elements of Perera’s argument are compelling, such as his condemnation of the autocratic nature of the medical establishment and his critique of public sector doctors engaging in private practice, Perera’s social positioning and his deep-seated contempt for the medical profession blinds him to the critical role played by the MOH in the preventive health sector.     MOH and the health system The MOH is a vestige of the health units system introduced in British Ceylon by the Rockefeller Foundation who arrived on the island in the early 20th century to deal with the hookworm scourge on tea plantations. Disgruntled by an uncooperative Planters’ Association, the Rockefeller Foundation shifted its sanitary efforts to the Western Province where the inaugural health unit was set up in Kalutara in 1926.   The health units system gradually expanded to cover the entire island. Serving the demands of imperial medicine, medical doctors were assigned to health units where they worked towards promoting maternal and child health and preventing the spread of communicable diseases. Thus medical doctors did not usurp the MOH position in the 1970s as per Perera’s argument.   At present, the country is divided into 330 plus MOH areas, each led by a MOH.These areas are further split into Public Health Inspector Areas, which, in turn, are divided into Public Health Midwife areas, each (ideally) covering a population of ~3000 to 5000. The MOH teams up with a public health nursing sister, public health nurses, public health inspectors and public health midwives, to deliver preventive health services in the relevant MOH Area.   The MOH is not a glamorous position in the medical hierarchy which places hospital-based specialists at the apex. Yet, these doctors are essentially the linchpin of the preventive health sector, coordinating between MOH public health teams and district level health administrators. They oversee service delivery at the community level, including maternal and child health, family planning, and communicable and non-communicable disease prevention, while carrying out medical consultations at maternal and child health clinics. They also play a crucial role in disease notification, the School Health Programme and other community-based health education initiatives, and are responsible for food sanitation, and occupational and environmental health.   Admittedly, many of these functions are not carried out optimally owing to crippling staff shortages at all levels. Cadre positions lie vacant in many remote and rural areas. In the Northern Province, for example, field midwives often cover two public health midwife areas, with grave implications for public health. As Perera points out, the Government needs to invest much more in this system.     Misplaced criticism Perera suggests that we do away with the MOHs as it is “a wholly irrelevant position in community life.” He attributes the rise in dengue to the incompetency of MOHs. It is unclear on what basis he makes these claims. It is well recognised that dengue is a product of rapid and unplanned urbanisation compounded by a crisis in garbage disposal. The health sector cannot do very much about the spread of dengue without the necessary support from government and non-health sectors. It is farfetched to attribute the failure of the preventive sector vis-à-vis dengue, the resurgence of leprosy, and even a lack of sanitary facilities,to MOHs being doctors.   Moreover, Perera’s allegations do little justice to the many socially minded MOHs who do not engage in private practice. While working in the health sector, I have met a number of dynamic MOHs working tirelessly with limited resources. In addition to running primary care clinics and overseeing the work of public health inspectors and public health midwives, they have been responsible for initiating various health promoting activities within their respective MOH areas. Examples from Jaffna District include the promotion of organic home gardening and the use of a nutritious mix of grains and cereals (‘saththa maa’) manufactured locally to address malnutrition, which is rampant in the Northern Province. While Perera labels such activities as completely irrelevant, he unwittingly contradicts his own position that prevention is better than cure.   Also notably absent in Perera’s analysis are the successes of the preventive health sector in spite of medical doctors holding positions of administration. For instance, its role in the much proclaimed low maternal mortality ratio and, more recently, WHO certification for malaria elimination. Despite such achievements, financial allocations to the preventive sector have declined over the years as more and more funds are channeled toward curative care. Rather than focusing solely on doctors, Perera should expose the Government’s role in Sri Lanka’s health sector crisis.     Need for clarity Perera’s criticism of the medical profession and private practice is valid. However, his writings are confused and often unsubstantiated. For instance, during the SAITM crisis and student boycott, Perera’s antipathy to the medical profession led him to undermine the students’ call to protect ‘free education.’ In fact, he supported the government’s efforts to privatise medical education by taking a questionable position on SAITM.  His latest article (Daily Mirror,  August 10th 2018), an attack of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, suggests that the joint statement of Deans of state medical faculties on SAITM was manipulated by the Federation of Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Associations (far from the truth in most if not all medical faculties). Perera is unable to see that the establishment of for-profit medical degree-awarding institutions like SAITM could jeopardize medical education in the country.   Many of the positions Perera articulates in his articles, including the denigration of MOHs, smack of Colombo-centric middle class elitism; trashing the public sector, including state hospitals and universities, is standard dinner table conversation in Colombo. In his pro-people analysis, Perera seems to have forgotten the ordinary families who rely on the public sector, including the MBBS qualified MOH (not a private sector specialist), for their maternal and child health needs.     Words of caution Yes, medical doctors are not the ‘saviours and guardians’ of the health sector, and they should embrace other healthcare professionals instead of obstructing their entry into the health sector. Yes, the maldistribution of medical officers should be addressed rather than placing them in administrative positions in Colombo. Having said that, however, Perera should be wary of trends in other parts of the world where physician administrators are increasingly replaced by MBA degree holders and others of that ilk who are trained to maximize cost-effectiveness and profits in the health sector. Second, Perera should think twice before supporting ‘task shifting,’ a particularly neocolonial approach that has its basis in the assumption that poorer communities in rural and remote areas can be served by a ‘low cost’ paramedical healthcare workforce. Finally, I urge Perera to separate his contempt for the medical profession and the Government Medical Officers’ Association from his analysis of the public health sector in order to offer a more informed critique in his writings.   [The writer is attached to the Department of Community and Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jaffna]"
"Rising temperatures to carry big price tag in steamy Sri Lanka","2018-07-27 13:14:48							0						 				985","By Amantha Perera(Colombo) THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION: Dinesh de Alwis has lived all his life in Ratmalana, a suburb of Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo. When he was young, he remembers, he would rush outside every day at 4 p.m., to play with friends after school.“Now if you send the kids out at four, they would faint of heatstroke. It’s that bad,” said the 40-year-old father of two, of the searing heat that has become part of everyday life here.Already steamy Colombo is expected to be one of the South Asian cities hardest hit by temperature hikes linked to climate change – hikes that are already being seen in many cities around the world.As temperatures continue to rise, Sri Lanka’s Western Province – which includes Colombo – is likely to see a 7.5 percent decline in living standards by 2050 “compared with a situation without changes in average weather”, according to a World Bank report released last month.That is likely to have far-reaching national consequences as one of the nation’s key economic centres struggles to keep cool, the report said.“This is a substantial drop, with potentially large implications for the country, given that the province contributes more than 40 percent of Sri Lanka’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP),” the report said.Muthukumara Mani, a co-author of the report and the World Bank’s lead economist for South Asia, said that the impact will vary across different sections of the population, with outdoor workers or the poor unable to afford air conditioning, for instance, particularly hard hit, and energy costs rising for many.“A rich household could be in a position to mitigate the impacts better than a poorer household, which would not have the financial capacity to do that,” Mani said. He said the construction industry and health systems are likely to feel the heat in particular.Some families say they are already running up higher bills due to rising temperatures.“When we were small we never used fans. It was never so warm that you could not sleep. Now we can’t sleep most nights without the air conditioner,” said De Alwis, who said he pays close to US$70 each month for air conditioning.Sunimal Jayathunga, director of the national Climate Change Secretariat noted that the country’s “adjustment to rising temperatures has not been ideal and (has been) too slow across the board”.In the past decade Colombo and the Western Province have been beset by worsening dengue outbreaks. Research by Sri Lanka’s University of Peradeniya has shown a link between rising temperatures, changing rainfall and outbreaks of the mosquito-carried disease.According to the World Bank report, more than 800 million people in South Asia will be affected by rising temperatures by 2050 and Sri Lanka in particular will see a loss of at least US$12 billion a year by 2050 if adequate measures are not taken to deal with temperature rise.Temperatures in the region are expected to rise by up to 3 degrees by 2050, the report said.Jayathunga, of the climate secretariat, said his agency was putting together plans for each of the country’s nine provinces to tackle climate change impacts. The plans are expected to be ready by the mid-2020s, he said.He said Colombo needs to deal with a range of problems, from worsening flash flooding to a lack of clean water. “But tackling rising temperatures is one of the urgent ones,” he said.Dealing with rising temperatures will require making Colombo’s people more aware of measures to adapt, such as conserving water and constructing buildings with more ventilation, Jayathunga said.“But all this takes time,” he said.The World Bank’s Mani said governments in South Asia have been focused on natural disasters and finding ways to deal with them, which has left more gradual and less visual threats, such as temperature hikes, overlooked in some places.“Lots of the time countries pay attention to disasters like floods and drought and make policy changes, but they should also look seriously at these kinds of slow-moving shifts that are happening, that could be equally dangerous,” he said.  "
"Global campaign to  test and treat Hepatitis Eliminating the disease is the immediate need of the hour","2018-07-27 12:54:47							0						 				3978"," Hepatitis is one of those infections that people are less aware of. Unless tested, one wouldn’t detect this viral infection as its symptoms appear only in selected instances. Hence the global campaign launched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) aims to test and treat this infection before it spreads to the rest of the world population. Statistics reveal that around 325 million people around the world are living with viral Hepatitis while 290 million of them are unaware of the symptoms.   In view of World Hepatitis Day, which is annually celebrated on July 28, the Daily Mirror spoke to Dr. Lalindra Dias, Consultant Physician at the District General Hospital – Nuwara Eliya, who elaborated on the types of Hepatitis, symptoms, treatment and prevention.    Inflammation of the liver Hepatitis is the inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis infections are prevalent among countries with a poor socio-economic status. As such Sri Lanka too is affected as a result of varieties of Hepatitis infections. Infections could be contracted by both males, females and children. The condition can be self-limiting or could progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver cancer.   Types According to Dr. Dias there are both infectious and non-infectious causes of Hepatitis. “Infectious causes include Hepatitis A,B,C,D and E while there are various non-infectious causes,” he said. “Among the most common non-infectious causes is Nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) also known as Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver disease. Alcohol is another leading cause of non-infectious Hepatitis. Various medications such as paracetamol and anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief should be avoided. This also includes limiting the excessive usage of herbal preparations. Other causes included autoimmune diseases and genetic and familial causes,”the doctor added.  Infectious types “Among the infectious types of Hepatitis, Hepatitis A and E are most common,” Dr. Dias added. “These two types are mainly transmitted through faeco-oral transmissions. These transmissions occur when patients don’t have good toilet practices and due to lack of poor sanitation. In turn they touch food and water and the infection is carried on. This is a common infection during floods and among people who live in slums and close communities. However there are vaccinations to prevent the Hepatitis A infection. On the other hand Hepatitis B and C are transmitted through unprotected sexual practices with unknown partners. Another reason is due to sharing of intravenous needles among drug users and very rarely through emergency blood transfusions. But nowadays the transmission through blood and blood products is extremely rare due to widely available high-tech screening programmes. These two types could also be transmitted from an infected mother to a foetus,”he explained.  Speaking further Dr. Dias said that other infectious causes such as dengue fever and leptospirosis could also lead up to Hepatitis infection.    Non-infectious types As mentioned before, NASH is one of the common causes of non-infectious Hepatitis. “This is common among patients with diabetes, high cholesterol and those who are obese,” Dr. Dias continued. “In order to prevent NASH it is important to control diabetes and reduce weight. In addition to that, high intakes of alcohol could lead to Hepatitis infections and patients could end up having cirrhosis,”he affirmed. How do you know that you are infected?Some of the acute features include the following : 	High fever	Body aches, lethargy and fatigue	Severe loss of appetite	Jaundice – discolouration of eyes and skin	Passage of dark-coloured urine      nSevere abdominal pain on the right side.   “If one develops the above symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor,” Dr. Dias added. “Usually Hepatitis A and E improve without many complications. But Hepatitis B and C could lead to chronic Hepatitis and patients could ultimately end up with cirrhosis. It could sometimes also culminate in conditions such as liver cancer.”he said. Prevention and treatments He further said that the Hepatitis infection could cause grave consequences such as cirrhosis, cancer and ultimately death. “Therefore it is important to prevent it to the best of your ability,” he continued. “This could be achieved through safe sexual practices, cutting down on excessive consumption of alcohol, not sharing intravenous drug needles, controlling diabetes and reducing weight. If you have the above symptoms, it is important that you seek medical attention. The doctor will do a couple of blood tests while testing liver enzymes and doing an ultrasound scan of the liver.” he said. According to Dr. Dias, Hepatitis A and E require symptomatic management. “This includes controlling the temperature, keeping the patient hydrated and avoiding liver-toxic drugs. While at the hospital, the doctors will safeguard the patient from further liver damage. Hepatitis could also be cured through vaccinations; for example Hepatitis B is already included in the National Immunisation Schedule. It is also advisable to get the Hepatitis A vaccination before travelling to countries such as India and Africa,”he stressed.  Aftercare “Once a patient has recovered from a Hepatitis infection he or she should take precautions,” he added. “As such a patient shouldn’t take painkillers such as paracetamol, anti-inflammatory drugs and also avoid the excessive usage of herbal medications. Patients should also cut down on the excessive consumption of alcohol and recreational drugs. Those who have been infected with Hepatitis A and E should engage in good sanitary and hygienic practices so that the infection isn’t transmitted to others. If a child has contracted Hepatitis, it is advisable that he or she doesn’t attend school during this period. It is the same with adults and patients are advised to rest as much as possible. In order to prevent Hepatitis B and C there are anti-viral agents that could be administered to patients,”he said.  World Hepatitis Day 2018  According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) viral hepatitis B and C are major health challenges, affecting 325 million people globally. They are root causes of liver cancer and leads to 1.34 million deaths every year.   Hepatitis B and C are chronic infections that may not show symptoms for a long period; sometimes years or decades. At least 60% of liver cancer cases are due to late testing and treatment of viral hepatitis B and C. Low coverage of testing and treatment is the most important gap to be addressed in order to achieve the global elimination goals by 2030.   WHO will focus on the theme: ‘Test. Treat. Hepatitis’ in view of World Hepatitis Day 2018. WHO organises events and activities with the aim to achieve the following objectives globally, in regions and in countries:   	 To support scale-up of hepatitis prevention, testing, treatment and care services, with specific focus on promoting WHO testing and treatment recommendations;   	 To showcase best practices and promote universal health coverage of hepatitis services;  	 To improve partnerships and funding in the fight against viral hepatitis.   "
"Eliminating  stigma associated with Mental disorders","2018-07-27 12:48:46							0						 				1844","   A mental health issue is like any other medical issue, or is it? What would you do if you  have fever, or severe abdominal pain? The majority of us would not hesitate to seek medical help, if we think that it may be something serious. But are we honestly giving mental disorders the same attention that we give physical illnesses? Even though 1 in every 4 people worldwide is likely to suffer from a mental disorder, according to the WHO, many people are reluctant to seek help, due to the stigma associated with mental illnesses. Today, on Health Capsule, we have consulted Dr. Udena Attigalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, in the hope of obtaining more information on mental health disorders, as education is an important component of removing the stigma associated with mental health issues.    It’s not all black and whiteMental health issues are a spectrum, varying from mild to severe, explains Dr. Attygalle. The spectrum for each category of mental health issue consists of various signs. Milder symptoms are named as ‘problems’, while moderate to severe symptoms are likely to be diagnosed as a ‘disorder’. For it to be diagnosed as a disorder it has to affect one’s life significantly, the doctor clarifies. Have you ever felt down, hopeless, losing interest in the things that you usually love, even for a short period of time? Then it’s likely that you have been placed in the spectrum of mental health issues; specifically that of depression, at some point in your life.    Common mental health issuesIf you take a random patient suffering from mental illnesses, you are more likely to get a person who is depressed, anxious or a child with a behavioral disorder, rather than a person who fits the image of what the society preconceives as‘mental illness. This, according to the doctor, is because these are the most prevailing mental health issues in today’s society.    Physical illnesses vs mental illnessesIf you or one of your loved ones has ever suffered from a mental health issue, you may have heard advises like ‘Get over it, it’s all on your mind’ and ‘You are not sick’. We ask the doctor, “Are these true? Is it all in our minds?”. Just as there are changes in your body’s chemical composition when you are physically ill, there are chemical as well as physiological changes associated with mental illnesses as well, he explains. But, since most of these changes occur in specific areas of the brain, which is an extremely complex organ, these changes are difficult to detect, he clarifies further.   Take, for an example, Dengue fever and Severe Depression. While both have the capacity to cause much harm, even death and depression cannot be diagnosed or monitored through blood tests, unlike dengue fever. Some of these changes can be observed through advanced imaging like FMRI, but are difficult to use as diagnostic tools.    Underlying causesMost Mental Disorders have a strong genetic component associated with them. In simpler words, the risk of developing a mental illness is higher in people whose close relatives are having mental disorders, when compared to the general population. But mental illnesses have a strong association with environmental factors like stressful life events and bereavements as well. But how these affect a person varies from each individual. Out of two people living in the same kind of environment undergoing similar life stresses, only one may develop a mental health issue. It’s also affected by the social background of a person, especially the social support he receives. A child with absentee parents and no friends is at a more risk of developing a mental health disorder.   Mental health issues have an association with the personality of the individual as well. A person who tends to look at the negative side of life and gets easily disheartened will be more susceptible to depression than a person with a more optimistic view of life.   There is something called the Bio Psycho Social model, which is used to describe the aetiology of mental health disorders, explains the doctor. This demonstrates that mental disorders are a result of a combination of Biological, Genetic factors, Psychological and social factors rather than due to a single aetiology.    Negative effects due to stigmaStigma is mainly twofold; stigma that has a link with the public which may sometimes cause you to avoid a person showing signs of ill mental health, and self stigma, where a patient fears stigma from the society and avoids either social interactions or seeking medical attention.   Generally, the help seeking behaviour is very poor in the society with regard to mental health. The stigma associated with mental ill health plays a major part in this regard. Patients and family members tend to ignore the symptoms until the patient is severely ill and needs to seek medical advice. The major disadvantage of this situation is that in most mental disorders, the potential for complete cure drastically reduces by delaying treatment.   In addition, the quality of life of a patient with a diagnosed mental disorder is significantly lowered due to the wrong perceptions the society has of him or her. The prospect of finding employment reduces and the patient being isolated from the society leads to poor self esteem and depression. This may make his condition worse. The first thing that we need to understand when it comes to the stigma associated with mental disorders is that contrary to popular belief, the majority of the patients with mental disorders can be treated. They function well in the society just like you and I.    Eliminating stigmaWhat is our role in reducing the stigma associated with mental health? Accurate information and being educated about the condition is the main enemy of stigma, explains Dr. Attygalle. Knowing that the genetic and environmental causes as well as individual factors contribute in causing mental disorders, understanding that there is a wide spectrum of mental disorders is prevalent in the world and that many of them are treatable is a good initiation to understanding about mental disorders.   Having positive experiences associated with mental health conditions is another way of reducing stigma. You may have a friend who has suffered from depression, but copes better than you and I when faced with a stressful situation. Understanding that they are humans who are simply suffering from an illness is also crucial.   The role of the media associated with mental health is large, though sadly, more frequently than not, this opportunity is used to spread negative messages about mental ill health. Understanding how the media and entertainment industry reflect on mental disorders is not always accurate, that violence and aggression associated with mental disorders are exceptions, rather than the rule. This is vital towards eliminating stigma associated with mental health.   One final message to our readers who are or who know someone who is suffering from a mental health issue: Even though it’s not visible outwardly, mental disorders can be equally painful as physical illnesses. Do not hesitate to seek help from a qualified psychiatrist, since as we highlighted previously in the article, the chance treatment being successful is high, in seeking medical care early.     "
"Tragedy doctoring the Health Service What JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa proposes is to produce more doctors for the private sector at public expense","2018-07-27 01:20:23							1						 				2445","JVP MP moves wants two more medical faculties, saying country has only 50 per cent of required doctors In addition to Teaching Hospitals medical faculties need more resources and facilities to turn out quality productsAlready the existing medical faculties do not have the required full-time teachersNone of the successful campaigns against diseases had doctors involved-all were by PHIs and PHMs Can more medical doctors reverse the continuing decline in our health service? JVP member in Parliament Dr Nalinda Jayatissa has moved two private member motions to establish medical faculties at the Uva Wellassa and Moratuwa Universities, with Badulla and Nagoda Hospitals proposed as “Teaching Hospitals”.   His argument is that Sri Lanka has only 50 per cent of the required number of medical doctors and medical faculties in State Universities can only accommodate 1,200 to 1,300 medical undergraduates each year-therefore, the need to establish two more medical faculties to increase the number of student intake.   There is something rather sneaky in his proposal to have Nagoda Hospital as the Teaching Hospital for the proposed Moratuwa Faculty. Why go that far when there are two other hospitals much closer in Panadura and Bandaragama?Besides that, though a medical doctor, the JVP politician fails to understand that to produce a ‘quality’ medical professional, a Teaching Hospital is not the only necessity.   A Medical Faculty needs many more resources and facilities to turn out quality professionals.   Though the GMOA and Deans of Medical Faculties in State Universities cry foul over the SAITM Medical Faculty, they are selfishly silent on the quality of education in their own medical faculties including Rajarata, Ruhuna (Karapitiya) and Eastern University.   Most faculties don’t have permanent qualified teaching staff and are wholly dependent on “visiting” professors and lecturers from elsewhere.   The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), throttled by the GMOA mafia in decision making, has evaded this lapse and the necessity of having a permanent teaching staff in their draft on ‘minimum standards in medical education’ by allowing medical professionals in Teaching Hospitals to be counted as teaching staff.   This is one of the many reasons, the GMOA as a trade union, should be completely barred from running for positions in the SLMC and the reason, why the SLMC should be restructured anew to give it better representation from other professions and to “societal” interests.  The whole approach in shaping our health service with medical doctors and the argument that we need more medical doctors raises the vital question, “what we as a society expect from our health service?”   Do we want more and more patients to seek outdoor and indoor treatment in hospitals for medical doctors and specialists to have a thriving private practice?   Do we have to keep increasing the number of medical doctors to treat increasing numbers of patients? Is that what we are looking for?  The argument for more medical doctors, the JVP MP Dr Jayatissa is echoing, is one borrowed from his own ilk in the GMOA.   If the existing number of medical doctors is 50 per cent of the required number, he should explain, why medical doctors are posted in numerous offices to attend to administrative work.   On the Health Services, Minutes Gazetted in October 2014 that comes after the GMOA mafia endorses it, there are 324 administrative posts strictly for medical doctors.   There are also 341 MOH positions for medical doctors. Lately, there are other stupidly unnecessary office positions created in the 25 RDHS offices with designations like MO-IT, MO - Planning and MO-Health Education, while in Colombo Hospitals, there are other posts that keep cropping up like MO-5S and MO-QC.  These office-based positions totalling around 800 don’t need medical graduates.   While increasing numbers of medical doctors take over such idling administrative positions, the overall health service is on the decline.  The alarming spread of Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is one proof.   The spread of dengue is mainly due to the callous disregard of the once very effective monitoring and regulating mechanism that was then under a Senior Public Health Inspector (PHI) but now controlled by medical doctors sitting in MOH Chairs.  With medical doctors in office as MOHs, not interested in enforcing monitoring proper and regulating, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence in most Provinces although the highest incidence of DF/DHF is seen in the Western Province (44.9% in 2007).   In the recent past, the incidence of DF/DHF has been more marked in the NCP (4.8% in 2004 vs. 11.8% in 2007), Wayamba (10.2% in 2004 vs. 15.9% in 2007) and Sabaragamuwa (6% in 2004 vs. 12.2% in 2007) and with 35,008 cases reported in 2009 with 346 deaths, according to the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry.   With all the rhetoric available from medical officers manning decision-making and implementing positions in the health sector, during the first three months of 2018, there were 14,627 reported cases of DF/DHF.   The result is that we have hospitals with DF/DHF patients cramped everywhere in the hospitals.  In Sri Lanka, this needs to be stressed and emphasized with the GMOA mafia wanting to portray and project the medical profession as the sole saviour and guardian of our health services. It is a total and an absolute lie.   It wasn’t medical doctors who worked towards lifting Sri Lanka’s health status to that of the more advanced countries. From hookworm to poliomyelitis, from malaria to whooping cough, smallpox and filariasis, all outbreaks and recurrences were eradicated through a well monitored and regulated community based preventive healthcare service handled by paramedical servicemen and not by medical doctors.   PHIs played a very vital role in carrying out an islandwide awareness on personal hygiene and developing cleaner sanitation. They were responsible for creating a new generation that paid more attention to personal cleanliness and better family hygiene. It was also PHIs and the Midwives who played a very committed role in making immunization and vaccination programmes a success in the 1960s.  In the 1980s with WHO support and guidance the anti-leprosy campaign was efficiently and successfully carried through to declare leprosy as eradicated in 1992, without medical doctors playing any significant role.   Now that medical doctors have taken over leprosy prevention, there is once again a warning of a possible increase in leprosy cases.   Yet, another interesting piece of news was from Moneragala, when the now hyped Gam Peraliya development programme was launched over a month ago.   It was reported, 25,000 households were without proper toilets. A special allocation was set aside for their construction. Truth is, if the MOH was effectively monitoring and regulating community health in his or her area, this lack of toilets should have been remedied, long before Gam Peraliya was launched.   This also raises the question why allocations for their construction were channelled through the Divisional Secretariat (DS) and not through the MOH.   The fact is, MOH is now a wholly irrelevant position in community life even after the spread of dengue fever.   MOH is not seen or heard of even in dengue prevention campaigns that are carried through Development Officers in DS offices, LG councillors and local area Police, at times backed by the STF as well.  Therefore what we should as a society demand from our health service is a very strong preventive community healthcare system to reduce numbers admitted to hospitals.   A preventive healthcare system makes hospitals in the curative healthcare system less important. Sri Lanka’s proud status on health rankings was achieved on a comparatively very low budget that depended more on preventive health care and sanitation than on curative healthcare and medical doctors.  Preventive community health care with trained paramedics checking on households regularly is certainly not as expensive as curative health care with sophisticated hospitals, long lists of expensive medicinal drugs prescribed by medical doctors and specialists, supported by semi-professional staff like MLTs, Radiographers and Physiotherapists.   Sri Lanka needs to give more importance to preventive community health care over curative healthcare that should have a strict referral system.  We are wasting money on curative health with heavy investments going in search of the most modern and expensive health equipment to meet ever-increasing numbers of patients.   This is due to GMOA backed medical professionals holding all key positions in the health hierarchy who are not “pro-people” as they project themselves to be.   We also need to break out of international norms and standards, where and when necessary to design programmes for our own need(s).   We should get back to the well-knit preventive healthcare service with paramedics at the community level that we had till the 70s. This can be redesigned under specially trained senior PHIs designated as “Area Community Health Officers” (ACHO) to clear out this mess. The ACHOs should also have well trained “Public Health Midwives” (PHM) in the field.   The present WHO norm of having one PHI for 10,000 persons and one PHM for 3,000 persons should be revised for a more practically valid ratio.  It is humanly impossible for a PHM to care for 3,000 pregnant mothers and infants within a month that includes home visits too.  So is it with PHIs. The present MOH who is a medical doctor can thus be repositioned as the GP in outpatient dispensaries in ACHO divisions.  A community based preventive healthcare system would help reduce the heavy cost of producing medical doctors through low-quality medical faculties proposed at public expense.   Experience during past decades proves that increasing the numbers of medical doctors produced does not in any way improve the health of people. They only get comfortably absorbed into the thriving private sector health industry that lacks full-time medical doctors.   Thus, what JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa actually proposes is to produce more medical doctors in the private sector health industry at public expense.   The medical profession now only feels money, not human pain.  "
"Leptospirosis : Be aware of severe rat fever!","2018-07-12 00:00:02							0						 				2287"," 	This bacteria is excreted when these mammals urinate and ends up in soil and water	 	The initial acute or septicaemic phase lasts about one week Leptospirosis, commonly known as rat fever, is mainly a disease infecting people working outdoors. This is a disease that occasionally causes serious consequences and even death. It’s a bacterial infection brought by animals. Though it’s called rat fever, the germ is carried by other mammals like cattle, pig, goats, dogs, raccoons and bats. This bacteria is excreted when these mammals urinate and ends up in soil and water. The germ can enter humans through abraded skin (scratches, wounds, eczema and shoe cuts or through intact mucous membrane/mouth, genitals)This disease is a biphasic illness. The initial acute or septicaemic phase lasts about one week. The second phase is an immune phase with circulating antibodies (IgM) accompanied by excretion of the bacteria in the urine.   Contest in Sri LankaLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease and one of the main communicable diseases in Sri Lanka. The disease is endemic in Sri Lanka with occasional outbreaks.Consultant Transfusion Physician Dr. Kumudini Gonsalkorale told the Daily Mirror that the farming community and those who spend much time with animals were susceptible to the disease in Sri Lanka.“In the rural areas, it’s the farmers and agricultural workers who are mostly affected. In the urban areas the disease often affects the slum dwellers,” Dr. Gonsalkorale said.“The situation in Sri Lanka is pathetic. The death of the breadwinner makes the whole family destitute. Their voices are never heard. The illness never receives prominence because it mainly affects the lower income group. A death of a poor farmer never affects others. It is only the kith and kin of these poor people who suffer,” Dr. Gonsalkorale affirmed.“In Sri Lanka, leptospirosis is reported throughout the year. Annually there are two peaks in the disease incidence; at the time of the monsoons, a smaller one during March -May and a larger one during October - December,” she added Even with ICU care, 70% or more of those with lung haemorrages cause death. No definitive treatment is available for these patients with pulmonary haemmorrages Dr. Gonsalkorale According to the Epidemiology Unit, there had been a significant increase in reporting and identifying leptospirosis cases over the past few decades since identification of the first confirmed leptospirosis case in 1953. In the year 2008 Sri Lanka reported the largest outbreak of leptospirosis with 7423 suspected cases and 204 deaths. Subsequently, 4980 cases and 145 deaths were reported in 2009 and in 2010 the number of cases was 4553 with 121 dying.The highly endemic areas are Colombo, Gampaha, Matale, Kurunegala and Kalutara which are known to be overcrowded with agricultural communities and changing weather and environmental factors.The factors affecting prevalence of the leptospirosis in Sri Lanka can’t be investigated in to. Seasonal analysis is needed in the wet and dry zones corresponding with the main Yala and Maha agricultural seasons. The annual rainfall is mainly associated with the prevalence of leptospirosis in the wet zone while the agricultural environment associated with the prevalence of leptospiros is in the dry zone.   The new procedure has been effective that it has reduced the number of deaths reported from the sever form of the rat fever Dr. Welivitiya New procedures of control Dr. Gonsalkorale said that the pulmonary haemorrages (bleeding into the lungs) which is the severe form of this disease had a very high mortality rate.This is also called ‘Weil’s disease’ and it can develop after the acute phase as the second phase of the biphasic illness or can simply present as a single progressive illness. The outcome can become very severe.“Even with ICU care, 70% or more of those with lung haemorrages cause death. No definitive treatment is available for these patients with pulmonary haemmorrages,” Dr. Gonsalkorale said.“After considering the high percentage of deaths reported due to the cause of pulmonary haemmorrages, the National Blood Transfusion Service has commenced a procedure called Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) to control pulmonary haemorrages. This procedure was initiated by the Teaching Hospital of Karapitiya in 2016,” she said. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a treatment that removes plasma from the blood. The removed plasma is then replaced with a substitute. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. It helps carry blood cells and other substances throughout the body.Consultant Transfusion Physician of the Blood Bank Dr. Theshanthi Welivitiya said they had carried out plasma exchanges for more than 150 patients since 2016 with pulmonary haemorrhage and percentage of recovery was 70%.“The new procedure has been effective that it has reduced the number of deaths reported from the sever form of the rat fever,” Dr. Welivitiya said.“The only issue is that the Colombo South Teaching Hospital is an overcrowded hospital and once again accommodating patients in an ICU becomes a huge problem. The main problem faced is that this expensive machine used for the procedure has to be pushed from place to place in order to treat these patients,” Dr. Welivitiya added. Symptoms   Leptospirosis may present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. It may also mimic many other diseases such as dengue fever, influenza, meningitis, and hepatitis. Jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin) is a relatively common symptom in leptospirosis, but is also found in many other diseases involving the liver. However, following symptoms are common when it comes to leptospirosis.    Preventive measures   The disease can be prevented to some extent by taking precautionary measures, yet many folks are unaware of the disease or the preventive methods. If you are involved in occupations such as farming, mining, cleaning drains and canals etc. please be alert. The following specific measures can help to prevent leptospirosis.    	Removal of rubbish and keeping areas around human habitation clean.   	 	Keep animals away from gardens, playgrounds, sandboxes, and other places where children play.   	 	Appropriate, protective clothing, knee-high boots, gloves etc should be worn and wounds should be covered with waterproof dressing  	 	Use boiled water for drinking (chlorination is seldom useful, as virulent organisms withstand up to 4 Parts per million (ppm); filtered water is also not safe)   	 	Avoid walking in flood water   	 	Use the medicine called Doxycyclin which is distributed free by the health ministry to be taken as a preventive drug.    "

"Hairless by hair loss","2018-06-22 10:54:32							0						 				4420"," Everyone dreams of being proud owners to thick, luscious and voluminous hair. However hair loss stands in the way of making that dream a reality. Hair loss isn’t merely just fall of hair in excessive amounts. There may be medical complications involved that lead to loss of hair in chunks. When this happens alarm bells should ring in the mind and indicate that it’s high time to seek medical advice. Dr. Nayani Madarasingha,  Consultant Dermatologist, speaks to Health Capsule this week about hair loss, its causes and cure.   When to worry More than a thousand hairs reside on a healthy scalp. Each hair undergoes a growth cycle. “This cycle consists of 3 phases. The first phase is the growth phase where hairs undergo growth and this may extend to a time frame of a few years. This phase varies according to each individual,” explained Dr. Madarasingha. This is why the length and volume of hair differ from person to person.   “Secondly, the hair enters the catagen phase. Here the hair ceases its active growth and the connection of the hair fibres to the roots is lost. The final phase is the telogen phase which is the resting phase of the hair. This lasts for 3 months and this phase is common to people.   After each hair strand completes its life cycle, it will fall off after 3 months of the resting phase. A new hair strand will grow in its place from the hair follicle,” she continued.   According to the Dermatologist, an individual tends to lose 50-100 strands a day which is actually quite normal. So this kind of hair loss is no cause for alarm. However there are cases where hair is shed abnormally and the hair volume starts getting affected by the loss of hair. When this happens it is high time to receive treatment and prevent further hair loss.   Root causes Excessive hair shedding and hair thinning are the two reasons that take the blame for abnormal loss of hair.   There are several factors that lead to excessive hair shedding. “Firstly, it could occur as an acute phenomenon after a stressful event such as pregnancy, surgery, dengue, etc. At the end of the resting phase, hair strands should shed for the new ones to surface. However this circumstance causes an individual to lose even up to 90% of hair. On a more positive note, the lost hair can be replaced with new ones in another 3 months.   Drugs prescribed for certain diseases especially those taken to treat cancer affect the growth of hair and leads to an arrest in the growth of the hair strands, causing them to fall off. Other drugs taken for conditions such as cholesterol too lead to excessive shedding.   Hormonal imbalances and thyroxin deficiency in particular can cause abnormal hair loss. Diet issues, iron and vitamin deficiencies too lead to problems associated with hair loss. Certain medical illnesses may cause excessive hair loss as well,” stated Dr. Madarasingha.   Hair loss due to hair thinning, informally known as the balding process, is mainly hereditary and caused by genetics. “This type of hair loss is also referred to as ‘pattern hair loss’ as hair is lost gradually. This is seen in both males and females. In women, pattern hair loss may not always be caused due to genetics. Hormonal imbalances and complications such acne, polycystic ovarion syndrome can lead to pattern hair loss,” she accentuated.    Diagnosis If treatment is started early, this progression can be prevented and slowed down. “People tend to treat these conditions themselves and think that oil massages, etc will help recover the lost hair. However hair loss has become an issue that requires medical attention as it may be caused due to various medical reasons as mentioned above. It’s very important to identify the cause for hair loss suffered by an individual,” she advised.   There are various diagnostic methods available to target  the type of cause responsible for hair loss in a person. “An analytical examination is the most basic form of diagnosis where a thorough examination is conducted on the patient, also inspecting the patient’s family history on diseases and hair loss as well. There are special instruments that are used in the diagnosis too. Biopsies may be conducted, but this is a diagnostic method that is very rarely resorted to. Hair loss due to certain hormones and vitamin deficiencies can be identified simply by a blood test,” Dr. Madarasingha informed.    Treatment available   Many methods of treatment for abnormal hair loss are available and they are said to be safe and successful. Treatment is based on the diagnosis of the cause for hair fall. Topical applications on the scalp and oral tablets that should be continued on a long-term basis are common methods of treatment. “If a patient suffers from an advanced case of  hair loss, the common methods may not prove to be 100% effective. In such cases, the answer would be hair transplants,” she said.   A technique known as PRP ( Platelet Rich Plasma) is currently being used in hair loss treatment where a small amount of the patient’s own blood is extracted and the platelets in the blood are isolated and then injected to the scalp of the patient. “Blood platelets contain a component known as growth factor which will allow hair to grow back. This procedure too is said to be a safe and reliable one with positive results,” the Dermatologist assured.    Not just a female problem! According to the Dr. Madarasingha, conditions like pattern hair loss is not just restricted to individuals above 40 years of age or older. Sometimes people in their early twenties and even younger are susceptible to these complications. It’s often thought that hair loss is a complication that affects females only. However this is not true. Hair loss is impartial to both males and females alike. Females are simply worried about hair loss than males and tend to take action unlike them!  "

Those who lack the courage to do what is right; and there are SO MANY OF THEM, will always find a philosophy to justify it!!! We simply cannot count the number of wrongdoers who are continually being brought to Court and sent away!!!Recording of evidence never ends; we have lost count of the number!!! We continually read Mahanama and Dissanayake re-remanded, Rangajeewa and Lamahewa re-remanded, on an almost daily basis people are being produced in Court but NOTHING FINALISED???Produced and re-produced, remanded and re-remanded!!! WHEN AND WHERE IS THIS TOMFOOLERY GOING TO END??? PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT WHEN TRUTH BECOMES A VICTIM TO POLITICS!!! The count on the Perpetual Treasuries List is increasing by the day!!! THE ALL IMPORTANT NAMES ARE NOT FORTHCOMING THOUGH!!! WE WONDER WHY??? ILLS OF THE GOP  The Educated One says “the UNP will never defend thieves,” who made Ravi K the first Minister of Finance in this regime??? The one who claims “MY TASK IS TO GIVE NEW HOPE TO ALL UNP MEMBERS AND MILLIONS OF OUR VOTERS” Where we ask is the hope he has given to the millions of parents who still find it impossible to get their children into schools??? Does that not matter, or is that not one of his priorities??? As the new General Secretary of the Grand Old Party, he is going to solve ALL THE ILLS OF THE PARTY IN ONE FELL SWOOP!!! The UNP should consider itself privileged to have such a capable General Secretary!!! He is going to make the Impossible Possible!!! We will still be around to watch his stellar performance!!! Not so healthy Situ  The Healthy One who returned recently after capturing a post at the UN is such a humanitarian that he refused point blank to go into the overcrowded ward at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Hospital in Dambulla!!! Those poor women have no room TO EVEN SIT ON THE FLOOR, IT IS SO HORRIBLY OVERCROWDED, BUT DID ANYONE CARE??? Igp Step In Please The Traffic jams and Traffic Cops – yes, we have been taught to give merit where merit is due but the Traffic Cops of our country deserve NO MERIT for the inhuman delays and punishment they put us through, simply because they have absolutely NO IDEA HOW TO DIRECT TRAFFIC!!!THEY MAKE THE CRUCIAL MISTAKE OF FIRST PUTTING OUT THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND THEN TRYING TO DIRECT TRAFFIC!!! THEIR SENSE OF DIRECTION SADLY POINTS ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION!!! SO GOD HELP US ALL!!!If these idiots just leave the Traffic Lights on, THERE IS A SENSE OF DIRECTION AND A SMOOTH FLOW OF TRAFFIC!!! Perhaps it is time the IGP stepped in and brought a sense of direction to the lives of these misguided Policemen so that they will not continue to display their ignorance and inconvenience the public, like they do!!! Who cares As I have said before, we live in a world of declining moral values!!! They are tinkered and tampered with to the detriment of society.Sadly, our Sri Lankans, in general, seem to have lost their sense of values!!! The saddest and most detrimental part is that they have no politicians, no one at the top to guide them in what is right!!! Road repairs are being carried out in the daytime, when it is time for people to go home!!! The end result is the general public is inconvenienced but no one cares!!!Huge empty water tanks are left at random on the roads; near the parks, no one knows the purpose they serve, more importantly, no one cares!!! When it rains these tanks fill with water and breed mosquitoes, the mosquitoes, in turn, bring in the dreaded dengue and other fevers!!! Yet, no one cares; the empty tanks are just left standing!!! The other menace is garbage; our streets, highways and byways are polluted with garbage!!! Does anyone care??? Is there any punishment meted out to those who irresponsibly dump garbage???The reason for all this decadence is total lack of discipline!!! No one to impose discipline, no one to take action where action is required, so the people have also fallen into this attitude of  ‘WHO CARES???’There is no value attached to anything, whether it is in homes, schools, offices, public places; values are declining rapidly and falling to dangerously low levels!!! It is indeed a shame that the majority of Sri Lankans have lost their sense of self-worth!!! Sri Lankans, in general, used to be proud of what they wore, how they dressed, what they ate, how they went around, what they talked about. Now no one seems to care, it is really sad!!! More importantly, when a new product is introduced, irrespective of what the product is, the first lot you get is super but, as soon as they know the product has caught on, BANG goes the quality and no one cares about that!!!Why are our people so lackadaisical; why is it that maintaining QUALITY IS NOT IMPORTANT ANY MORE??? ONE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE WAKE OF DENGUE WAS THE ‘CITRONELLA’ ‘PANGIRI THEL’  JOSS STICKS GUARANTEED TO DRIVE AWAY THE MOSQUITOES!!! IN ALL FAIRNESS IT WAS SUPER, YOU LIT ONE AND THE AROMA PERVADED THE WHOLE HOUSE!!! IT WAS SO EFFECTIVE, NOW YOU LIGHT EVEN TWO AND NOTHING HAPPENS!!! HOW QUICKLY DID THAT DETERIORATE??? Why do our Sri Lankans find it so easy to compromise on QUALITY??? Shouldn’t we be proud of the product we sell, shouldn’t we be proud that we are giving our fellow human beings a product of VALUE??? Why stoop to devalue the product we sell??? Why do we find it so easy to deceive our own countrymen??? Oh that one hundred days People are naturally taking their cue from the politicians, from what is happening around them!!! All we read about are the Udayangas, the Jaliyas, the Mahendrans and so many others who have all been allowed to get away!!!WHY, WE ASK IS IT TAKING SO LONG, SO VERY LONG FOR JUSTICE TO BE SERVED!!! THERE DEFINITELY SEEMS TO BE SOME SECRET HIDDEN AGENDAS!!! IT IS ABOUT TIME THE GOVERNMENT IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT; REALIZES THAT YOU CAN FOOL SOME OF THE PEOPLE SOME OF THE TIME, BUT NOT ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME!!! It won’t be long before they have to come to the people again and then they would be in for the shock of their lives!!! Perhaps then they will realize THEY WERE THE FOOLS!!! Now they are trying to talk us into believing that there is this highly publicized 100-Day Programme, apparently drafted by Eminent Persons!!!One of our eminent Buddhist Priests said the 100-Day Programme has been copied from a USA Programme!!!Be that as it may, we are constrained to ask why it took over three years for them to even talk about a 100-Day Programme!!!More importantly, what did they hope to achieve in these 100 days??? It would be interesting to find out!!!"

"“  PM is the  best bet as UNP’s  Presidential Candidate  ”","2018-06-05 00:48:15							11						 				6356","Tourism Promotion Minister John Amaratunga during an interview with the  spoke about the political situation of the country and the reforms of the United National Party (UNP) which he represents. Excerpts:     Q  What is your analysis of the current status of the Government?There is no difference. The national Unity Government will continue. The Ministers representing Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in the Government are also doing their normal work. In fact, new subjects have been assigned to the ministers now.    Q  In the assignment of subjects, some institutions, such as the Department of Archaeology which was held by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, have been entrusted with Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. Why is that?I don’t know. I am yet to see the gazette notification. I cannot comment on it as a result. There is no change in the subjects I held as the Tourism Development Minister.    Q  As an UNPer with 40-years of experience how do you view the current status of the party?Had the UNP obtained an absolute majority there would have been no problem. We would have forged ahead with our own policies. Since we had to join hands with the SLFP to form the Government, there were differences. Nevertheless, we’re working together.    As a result of FCID operations, we have been able to minimize corrupt practices Q  How do you compare and contrast the UNP’s present situation with its past?During the regime of J. R. Jayewardene as the President, we had five-sixth majority. We could implement anything we wanted. Today, the UNP is only a part of the Government.    Q  How do you view the differences in terms of policies? There is one difference here. We could implement projects speedily during the past. That is because of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). Officials fear making decisions because of the FCID’s operations. They think twice before implementing a decision.   There are two aspects here. That is to mitigate corruption. As a result of FCID operations, we have been able to minimize corrupt practices. Everyone is careful to make sure that financial regulations are upheld. That, however, causes delays in implementing projects.   Q  Did you experience this personally in your ministry?Yes. We have to implement the digital advertising programme regarding the promotion of tourism. Officials fear bypassing the procedures. They insist on following the procedures. It has delayed the implementation of the programme, hence affecting tourism.    Q  What’s the UNP planning to do in view of the Presidential Elections? The Working Committee will decide who should be our candidate. Two Ministers have already said that UNP Leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should be the candidate. If the Working Committee decides, we will go ahead with it. Minister Mangala Samaraweera clearly said the Prime Minister would be the candidate. If he says that, it may be the final decision.    Q  What is your opinion?I think the Prime Minister stands a good chance of emerging as the winner at the elections.    Q  You see him as the best bet?Yes, at the moment, he is the best bet. That is because of the enormous experience he has regarding governance and foreign and economic affairs. In early 1970s, people used to talk about J.R. Jayewardene as a hopeless candidate. He was viewed as an arrogant person. Yet, he proved to be the best candidate for the UNP.    The Mahinda Rajapaksa group is also very strong. When the anti-UNP vote base is divided between them, we can emerge victorious  Q  There is a cry from the UNP backbenchers that young blood should be infused to the UNP hierarchy. What is your opinion?I’m not against that view. They should be given more responsibilities. They must understand one thing. I will cite one example. After I enetered Parliament, I remained without a portfolio for 10 years. I was just an MP. I continued to wait. Later, I was appointed as the State Minister of Finance. Since then, I have been getting portfolios. One shouldn’t expect ministerial posts immediately after entering Parliament.    Q  If the party must groom another leader, who do you have in mind?There are enough and more at the second level of the party. Ministers Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake are there. We also have Ministers Harin Fernando and Mangala Samaraweera. There are five or six people identified as potential future leaders. As time progresses, we will find a person to fill the vacuum.    Q  What are the policy changes you expect in the party?The UNP has the same kind of policies. They cannot be changed. We are a democratic party and believe in the private sector as the engine of growth.    Q  How do you view the chemistry between the President and the Prime Minister?They are on talking terms though some people may think otherwise. I do not see any difference of opinion between them. The Unity Government will continue operating during the remaining 18 months.    Q  As far as the UNP reforms are concerned, what do you think of the recent appointment of new office bearers to key posts such as the General Secretary?I think those changes are enough. There is no need to make any drastic changes to continue for the next 18 months. Drastic changes can be made after the next elections.    Q  How hopeful are you of winning the next elections?The SLFP group led by President Maithripala Sirisena is also strong. The Mahinda Rajapaksa group is also very strong. When the anti-UNP vote base is divided between them, we can emerge victorious.    Q  You had similar hopes during the Local Government Elections held on February 10 because the President and the former President did not unite. But the UNP couldn’t win . Why is it?That is true. There were various views expressed in this regard. We did not get the expected results.    These foreign nationals, who were assaulted, did not come to give evidence. They made a hue and cry, and left. We couldn’t punish wrongdoers as a result Q  What do you think of UNP Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake being denied a ministerial post despite making requests?Mr. Karunanayake played a major role in the installation of this Government in 2015. He worked very hard for it. There were allegations against him regarding the alleged Bond Scam. According to the report, he hasn’t been involved in any scam. There is no reason for him to be deprived of a ministerial post. He hasn’t been found guilty.    Q  How is the growth within the tourism sector?In 2010, there were only 400,000 tourists. Now, we get 2.5 million arrivals. Every month the number is increasing. At the same time, there are obstacles in our way. There was the closure of the airport and dengue epidemic. We have heard of a few incidents where tourists were assaulted. They have hampered the development of tourism.    Q  Some ambassadors raised this matter with you. What did they discuss?They sent travel advisories. When the Dutch tourists were attacked, they sent travel advisories. These foreign nationals, who were assaulted, did not come to give evidence. They made a hue and cry, and left. We couldn’t punish wrongdoers as a result.   We have to get our digital campaign right to promote tourism. We have to ensure the safety of tourists. We are trying to develop the domestic airports. We have to expand our international airport. We need to increase the number of immigration officers. We have to develop the railway system. Many tourists are willing to travel by train.   There are many airlines willing to land here. Our landing and parking charges are very high. We have to bring them down.    Q  The recent tax hike has affected tourist industry. Foreign nationals have complained about high charges for food and accommodation due to increased taxes. How do you see this?We have received complaints both from locals and foreigners about it. In general, people find it difficult to live. When the rupee value depreciates, the rupee component of foreign exchange earnings increases. That is a plus point. Foreigners get the benefit from this.      "
"Trump’s blockade is to  provoke regime change – Cuban Ambassador","2018-06-04 00:03:46							0						 				2395","Cuba’s National Assembly elected Miguel Diaz-Canel as the country’s President in April. Diaz-Canel followed Raul Castro who served two consecutive terms from 2008 when the health of his brother Fidel was in decline. Fidel Castro, who led the 1959 revolution that overthrew Fulgencio Batista’s dictatorship and ruled the country since died in 2016. The Daily Mirror talked to Cuba’s Ambassador in Colombo, Elena Ramos Rodriguez, on what may be expected from the new leader from a post-revolution generation, US President Donald Trump’s hardened policy towards Cuba, its effects on the Cuban people and Cuba’s response to the intensified economic blockade imposed by the US government.   Excerpts:   Elena Ramos Rodriguez Cuba’s new President Miguel Diaz-Canel was born a year after the 1959 revolution, representing a relatively younger generation of politicians. Does this generational shift point to a change in Cuba’s style of government in years ahead?I want to highlight the significance of the last session of the Cuban parliament, on April 18-19 when Mario Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez was elected the new President of the Council of State and President of the Council of Ministers. I think the new leader will continue the revolutionary process, will continue the development of our country, the development of our Socialism. Cuban people express their support for this electoral process. The people elect the members of Parliament, the Parliament elects the Council of State, and the Council of State elects the president. This process comes with the support of the people because a majority - 85.65% attended the polls to elect their representation in parliament, from each municipality. Voting is voluntary … if you vote it means you support (the process).   Diaz-Canel’s predecessor Raul Castro had started introducing certain changes- reducing the size of the state sector, encouraging more private enterprise, loosening some controls etc. with benefit to the economy. Will the new President continue on this trajectory?Yes. The Cuban government and people are all working on updating the Cuban economic model. It is a complex process. It’s changing not because of pressure from outside but for Cuban society, to establish the economic and social guidance. It is a broad process, with many meetings with people in their workplaces, residential places etc. In Cuba, the programme does not change with each president. The guidelines are adopted with the opinion of all the population – in different ways they participate in the process.    ""The Parliament elects the Council of State, and the Council of State elects the president. This process comes with the support of the people because a majority - 85.65% attended the polls to elect their representation in parliament, from each municipality  ""Former US President Barack Obama had started a process of normalization of Cuba-US relations, signalled by re-opening diplomatic missions in the two countries. Under Trump, this process is being reversed, and the economic blockade is being intensified. What will Cuba’s strategy be, to cope with this situation?I think Obama’s years demonstrated that Cuba and the US can live and co-exist in a civilized way. Interactions between both sides show that Cuba and the US can exist, respecting our differences and cooperating, for the benefit of both countries and peoples, at the same time. Wherever there is an opportunity, we can cooperate.   Opportunity such as …?To stop drug trafficking, terrorism, illegal immigration. Intelligence is not the interest of one country – it’s for both countries. We share maritime borders. We have to cooperate for example in maritime rescue, to save people. Or to avoid contamination of our maritime waters. Cuba wants to continue negotiating with the US government, but on conditions of equality and respect for our sovereignty. Cuba will not resign any of its principles. Principles are non-negotiable.   But the fact is that you have a US President whose attitude is belligerent. How will you face this situation?We have to face the new measures. In November last year the US Departments of State, Treasury and Commerce issued new provisions and regulations to implement and strengthen the blockade against Cuba - a week after the Nov. 1stvote in the UN General Assembly on the necessity to lift the blockade. These measures were in a new executive order of the President called “National Security Presidential Memorandum on Strengthening the Policy of the US towards Cuba.” They restrict travel of American citizens to Cuba, restrict commerce between the two countries. During Obama’s time it was more flexible on some issues, but the blockade was still there, especially in the financial/ banking sector.   In 2016 the US abstention (during the UN vote on lifting the blockade) was a hopeful moment. These measures confirm the regress of bilateral relations as a result of the decisions of the government of Donald Trump. It is also important to say, these measures ignore US public opinion of about 75% which is a great majority, and the international community, and of the Cuban immigrants in the US. The majority of Cuban immigrants want normal relations. Only a small group in Florida want to continue the blockade. This transformation ignores the majority of the international community. On Nov. 1st 2017 for the 26th consecutive occasion, the resolution on “The necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the USA on Cuba” was approved by the General Assembly of the UN, with 191 votes in favour and two against: the US and Israel, confirming once again the absolute international rejection of this policy. Cuba will continue to present the resolution as long as the embargo is in place. Unfortunately the resolution is not binding. But it’s a good step to demonstrate that the international community supports Cuba.    ""MediCuba, the company that imports and exports medical products, received a communication from the supplier Lindmed Trade of Spain, saying it could not supply the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin Lactate because the manufacturer Claris Otsuka refused to sell the goods because Cuba was subject to sanctions imposed by the US""The UN Secretary General in July last year presented a report, at the request of the members of the General Assembly, on the implementation of this resolution. Cuba said “the accumulated losses caused by the embargo during nearly six decades it has been in place amount to US$ 822 billion.” Can you give an example of how this translates into deprivation in the day to day lives of the Cuban people?The blockade affects all fields – business, health, education, agriculture. To give an example – in March 2017, MediCuba, the company that imports and exports medical products, received a communication from the supplier Lindmed Trade of Spain, saying it could not supply the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin Lactate because the manufacturer Claris Otsuka refused to sell the goods because Cuba was subject to sanctions imposed by the US.   Ciprofloxacin Lactate is a broad spectrum antibiotic used for adults and children in the treatment of respiratory ailments. Also for skin, soft tissue, bones and joints affected by bacteria. This is an antibiotic used in all hospitals. This affects the health of our people not because the government doesn’t give the resources but because we cannot buy from the supplier.   		I think the new leader will continue the revolutionary process, will continue the development of our country, the development of our Socialism			The ending of the embargo was approved by the the UN, with 191 votes in favour and two againsT			Cuba produces nickel. The company was unable to export 3,500 tons of it, produced in 2016 because they could not find a bank... 			The blockade is the main obstacle to the development of our country. 			The US wants to provoke a change of regime, by provoking anger of the people through shortages, by depriving them of food, medication.   			Cuba appreciates support provided by Sri Lanka in its fight against the US embargo			Our policy is to give what we have. Others give what they don’t use. Fifty-five per cent of state resources is allocated for budgeted activity 	Could you briefly explain the extra-territorial aspect of the embargo, how third parties – other states - are punished for having transactions with Cuba? An example?The case I just mentioned is also a good example of the extra-territorial impact. The supplier, the Spanish company cannot trade with Cuba. They too are affected. Legally they should be able to trade with Cuba. Also, many other companies have been sanctioned, fined, for doing business with Cuba.   To give another example, Cuba produces nickel. The company was unable to export 3,500 tons of nickel sulphide produced in 2016 because they could not find a bank that would open a Letter of Credit. The loss to the Cuban economy was $23,600,000.   In June 2016 the Netherlands mail and parcels company TNT returned to the Consulate General of Cuba in Madrid, two postal consignments addressed to the embassies of Cuba in China and Indonesia containing passports of Cubans living abroad. The company claimed that it had returned the consignments owing to corporate instructions related to the US embargo.   The rest of the world supports Cuba on the need to end the embargo, which is in violation of the UN Charter and international law. Can you explain briefly, what is the problem the US has with Cuba?The blockade is the main obstacle to the development of our country. The US wants to provoke a change of regime, by provoking anger of the people through shortages, by depriving them of food, medication etc. They want a regime change favourable to the US. It didn’t happen because the Cuban people stayed brave. This policy satisfies only the interests of a small minority of the American and Cuban-American extreme right-wing of South Florida, whose interest is to reverse the process of normalization of bilateral relations. It is a violation of human rights in general. We have a good economy but it would be better if we didn’t have the blockade. Tourism is greatly affected. People like to visit Cuba, last year we had four million visitors. Imagine if there was no blockade! American citizens are not allowed to travel to Cuba as tourists, it’s prohibited. They need a special licence from the Treasury.    ""I think Obama’s years demonstrated that Cuba and the US can live and co-exist in a civilized way. Interactions between both sides show that Cuba and the US can exist, respecting our differences and cooperating, for the benefit of both countries and peoples, at the same time. Wherever there is an opportunity, we can cooperate""Cuba sends its professionals like goodwill ambassadors to all parts of the world – doctors, teachers, artists, agriculture experts - demonstrating the high level of culture and education it has achieved for its people, in spite of the problems caused by its big neighbour. What is the secret of this achievement?Our policy is ‘internationalist.’ One of the main principles in our relations with other countries is that we share what we have. If we can provide doctors, we do that. Our policy is to give what we have. Others give what they don’t use. Fifty-five per cent of state resources is allocated for budgeted activity such as education, public health, social security, pensions. That’s why there is a high standard. We believe you must support everybody. You cannot have homeless people. A mother who cannot work because her child has a disability will be provided with a government pension. It is a policy that demonstrates that even a poor nation that has not too many resources - if it uses resources for the welfare of the people - can grow its human capital, and improve living standards of the people, despite major challenges it faces. This is, maybe, our ‘secret!’   Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba after the revolution and (in the words of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his condolence message on the death of Fidel Castro) “Cuba has been a great friend Sri Lanka could count on.” How can the Cuba-Sri Lanka relationship be taken forward?A. Sri Lanka and Cuba have historic bonds of friendship and cooperation. Sri Lanka established diplomatic relations in 1959 after the triumph of the revolution, at the very beginning. The first step was the visit of Che Guevara to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka and Cuba both entered the Non Aligned Movement (NAM) in the same year, 1961. Cuba received the presidency of NAM from Sri Lanka in 1979. We have a long history of cooperation in sports, education, health, agriculture. At this moment we are working on areas of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. In June, a delegation from Sri Lanka visited Cuba to follow up on implementation of an MoU between the ministries of Science and Technology of the two countries. Last year a Cuban expert visited Sri Lanka to share expertise on the control of dengue. We are also working on registering in Sri Lanka a Cuban product for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. It has an efficiency of over 80%, many people have saved their legs, avoiding amputation. Cuba sincerely appreciates the support provided by Sri Lanka in its fight against the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba for almost 60 years. On Nov. 1, once again Sri Lanka voted in favour of the Cuban revolution against the blockade in the General Assembly of the United Nations.  "
"Turn to Ayurveda to strengthen your immune system","2018-06-01 00:00:00							0						 				3471","With heavy rains, landslides and strong winds continuing in most parts of the country, another problem is the influenza epidemic largely in the South and it could become serious if urgent and effective measures are not taken. On May 28, the Daily Mirror in a front page news report spotlighted the lack of facilities like Intensive Care Units (ICUs) but we need to focus more on measures to prevent the epidemic.   The usual method is by having mass vaccination campaigns. But flu vaccines have not had a good track record and usually the vaccines have to be made with elements of the target virus and other substances. This takes time. But perhaps there is an even better option - prevention.   Dr. Joseph Mercola who publishes popular newsletters worldwide on health and well-being refers to the power to prevent viral illnesses by using the famous Ayurvedic herb – “holy basil” or thulasi in Tamil and maduruthala in Sinhala, that is also revered by Hindus.   It is a common herb that grows all over Sri Lanka and therefore is readily available and easily administered – just by eating the raw leaves in a salad or sambol. About five leaves by adults and three by children under 12It is a common herb that grows all over Sri Lanka and therefore is readily available and easily administered – just by eating the raw leaves in a salad or sambol. About five leaves by adults and three by children under 12. Many who know the value of it say it works because they eat these leaves often and have not had a serious viral flu attack for several years.   This herb’s stimulating powers have been recognized by ancient healers and sages. In India people venerate thulasi or holy basil as a sacred plant. It is a part of Indian households, typically grown in earthen pots in the family home or garden.   One of the most important reasons why it is so famous, aside from the fragrant flavour as a basil type cooking herb, is that it is one of the most effective adaptogens--an agent that helps our bodies adapt more effectively to stress caused by diseases.   But thulasi also has another beneficial side effect, and that is helping to prevent and treat viral diseases such as Influenza, Dengue, Chikengunya, Swine Flu and Bird Flu.   According to Dr. Mercola’s article thulasi or holy basil may improve your body’s overall defence mechanisms, including its ability to fight viral diseases. It helps speed up your recovery process if you suffer from illnesses such as swine flu or Dengue. It also strengthens your immune system.   These benefits may stem from thulasi’s highly complex chemistry. It contains beneficial compounds called phyto-chemicals -- naturally occurring compounds that plants produce to protect themselves against bacteria, viruses and fungi -- that interact and have strong antioxidant, anti-viral, anti-bacterial and immune-enhancing properties. They promote general health and maintain your body’s natural defence against viruses, stress and disease.  If you are concerned about the Influenza, Dengue or any other viral disease Dr. Mercola highly recommends trying thulasi instead of the flu drugs or vaccines.   Many broad-minded medical analysts have recommended that Sri Lanka instead of depending so much on western medicine and medications should also give a place to time-tested medical systems such as Ayurveda, Homoeopathy and Acupuncture. Unfortunately western medicine, with the marvels of modern technology has today become a big business with many investors throwing their investments into private hospitals.     "
"Diving deep into the influenza outbreak","2018-05-31 00:00:01							0						 				1442","After the Dengue fiasco last year, the Seasonal Influenza Virus has taken centre stage as the most recent health scare. The disease is said to be spread mostly in the southern region of the country, claiming several lives including those of several young children. With not much information available on the present status of the disease, speculation is high, blowing the situation out of proportion. The Daily Mirror spoke to several individuals who are directly involved in dealing with the situation at different levels, clearing the air about these speculations and obtaining information on how to prevent the further spread of the disease. Health authorities are making a rough assumption that the disease came with the touristsHospitals and ICU’s overflowing with patients It’s reported that there have been 19 deaths so far of small children due to fever during the last 28 days, and 12 deaths from pneumonia in the Matara District General Hospital alone. Inside sources claim that the hospitals in Matara District are overflowing with patients having fever, and the bulk of the patients are being cared for at the Matara District General Hospital, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Kamburupitiya Hospital, Walasmulla Hospital, Tangalle hospital, Balapitiya Hospital and Elpitiya Hospital.   ICUs in the district are overflowing with patients having fever and this includes the ICU’s in the hospitals in private sector as well, according to the sources. Out of the 4 people deceased, on the 28 May at the Matara Hospital, 3 are due to respiratory causes. Three people including a 21-year-old youth have passed away due to pneumonia on 28 alone, at the Matara General Hospital.   On inquiring about the disease control measures taken it was initially reported that the schools of 8 divisions in Matara as well as all the pre-schools will be closed until June 1. Two epidemiology teams have been dispatched to the area to investigate the outbreak, according to the sources from the Health Ministry. Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal De Silva has requested an urgent report on the outbreak from the Regional Director of Health Services.   Daily admissions to the hospital for other disease conditions have drastically reduced. Patients don’t show up at the clinics nor do they present themselves for routine pre-scheduled surgery out of fear for the disease outbreak” he revealedThe silence maintained by the Government and the health ministry regarding this matter has become a source of frustration to the general public. The difficulty in obtaining correct information regarding the disease and the number of affected people has driven undue fear and panic into the residents. “All major surgeries in Karapitiya Teaching Hospital have been suspended due to the fever situation”Dr. Janath Liyanage GMOA Branch President at the Karapitiya Hospital“ Almost all our ICU beds are currently being occupied by patients having fever,” stated Dr. Janath Liyanage, Consultant Paediatric Surgeon and GMOA Branch President at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital (KTH) when asked to reveal the current situation at the hospital. Explaining further, he claimed that the ICU has been full for about two months now. All the major surgeries have been suspended until further notice, because the hospital cannot supply the required aftercare in the ICU for the patients undergoing these surgeries due to the ICU being overcrowded with patients having fever. “As a paediatric surgeon, I haven’t been able to do any major surgery for the past 2 months because of the unavailability of the ICU’s”, proclaimed Dr. Liyanage.   As for the overall situation in the southern province, he stated that even the doctors weren’t aware of the exact situation, due to the patients being sent to hospitals throughout the province.   “Not educating the public about the disease adequately has resulted in causing panic among the general population and there is the assumption that a deadly unknown germ is spreading in the Southern Province. Daily admissions to the hospital for other disease conditions have drastically reduced. Patients don’t show up at the clinics nor do they present themselves for routine pre-scheduled surgery out of fear for the disease outbreak” he revealed.   When inquiring into the source of the disease and the strain of the virus he explained that the influenza epidemic commenced last November in US, causing almost 4000 deaths. “In Sri Lanka, as far as we know, the disease started somewhere around Weligama area, so we can make a rough assumption that it came with the tourists,” he said.   “Like the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009 worldwide, it’s currently the influenza strain called H3N2 that is going around, though in a much smaller level, according to international data. So we are assuming that it’s the same strain that we are currently experiencing”, stated Dr. Liyanage.   He emphasized that up to now, the Epidemiology Unit in Sri Lanka has failed to release any information on the virus strain or the specification of treatment to the healthcare workers. “Usually, an infectious disease like this is treated according to a national guideline prepared and released by the Epidemiology Unit. When we requested for an updated guideline they asked us to follow the guideline which was released in 2015”, he said.   “GMOA is having a meeting with the minister to talk about expanding the ICU facilities. We have only 7 ICU beds, even though we have the space adequate for 6 more beds. We requested for the instruments last year, but so far they have not been given. So we are trying to add at least two or three additional beds and equipment to the ICU, to keep the hospital at a functional level,”he said.  Dr. Liyanage also stressed that the secondary infections are more dangerous than the Influenza itself. Most of the children presenting with fever, cough and cold improve within 3 to 4 days. Even though other symptoms disappear the cough can persist. They may again develop high fever with respiratory difficulties and cough, due to another germ that entered the system, due to the weakened tissues from influenza. These infections can be dangerous, causing respiratory failure and sometimes even death.“Influenza not only limited to Southern Province”Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama Infectious Diseases Hospital, Angoda When asked if there is a risk of the virus spreading to the other regions, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, Consultant Physician at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Angoda revealed that contrary to the popular belief, the disease currently persists in other areas of the country, though at a lesser level. He stated that the IDH has been receiving influenza patients for the past 1 1/2 months, currently having around 5-6 admissions of suspected influenza patients per day.” The condition of the majority of these patients is not in serious and they are treated outside,” he further claimed.   When inquiring into the specific strain of the virus he explained that the samples have been sent abroad to be analyzed. This is because Sri Lanka doesn’t have the facilities to analyze the virus and it might take some time for the results to arrive. “The strain of the virus isn’t important in treating the disease, because the treatment methods are similar between the strains of influenza”, he reassured.   The Daily Mirror further learned from him that the vaccine for influenza is recommended to a limited number of people who exposed to risk, even in countries like UK; where they experience yearly outbreaks of influenza virus. These groups ‘at risk’ include youngsters, the elderly, those who are suffering from chronic illnesses and healthcare workers. Therefore the vaccine isn’t required for each and every person and is better to be taken if recommended by a medical profession, he advised.    The vaccine, which is currently available only in the private sector, is not hundred percent effective due to the rapidly changing nature of the virus, he further claimed.   Department of Health and Department of Education along with private and public media organizations have a big role to play in preventing the spread of influenza, stressed Dr. Wijewckrama.    Patients don’t show up at the clinics nor do they present themselves for routine pre-scheduled surgery out of fear for the disease outbreakWhen asked if there is a change in the severity of the disease compared to the previous years, Dr. Wijewickrama claimed that he didn’t observe a drastic change as such, since there were similar incidences of severe influenza during the past couple of years, resulting in pneumonia and sometimes causing deaths of people in vulnerable groups.   The cause for the deaths associated with Influenza is mostly due to the delay in seeking medical care, he commented, explaining that sometimes patients wait until they have severe illness and respiratory difficulty to seek medical help. He added that sometimes the primary care doctors themselves fail to recognize that the patient needs hospitalized care. Dr. Wijewickrama also underscored that the main cause for the high morbidity in most patients with Influenza isn’t the influenza virus itself, but the secondary infections caused by bacteria. Most of this bacteria, which becomes deadly does not respond to antibiotics and it all relates again due to the ignorance of the patients, he declared. “Whenever a person develops a cough and cold, and even if it’s a viral illness, patients expect antibiotics to be prescribed. They demand antibiotics from the doctor or sometimes self-medicate themselves after obtaining medicine from pharmacies. Even some doctors are responsible for prescribing antibiotics inappropriately. So with the frequent use of antibiotics, the body becomes resistant to them and curing these bacterial infections becomes very difficult”, explained Dr. Wijewickrama, who strictly advised patients and the doctors not to use antibiotics unless the disease is of bacterial origin.   Numerous attempts made by the Daily Mirror to contact the Epidemiology unit to obtain the confirmed statistics and information on the disease spread proved futile.  Prevention and seeking medical attentionDr. Ganganath Gunathilake Consultant in Paediatric Respirtory MedicineAccording to Dr. Ganganath Gunathilake, Consultant in Paediatric Respirtory Medicine, educating people regarding prevention is crucial in minimizing the spread of the disease. Being aware and maintaining a good respiratory hygiene can go a long way towards controlling the spread of the disease.   Influenza is highly infectious within the first 7 days after symptoms develop. In preventing the spread of droplets, it’s important to remember that a cough can carry droplets a distance of roughly three feet. Therefore, if you are having symptoms like cough, fever and runny nose then it is important to wear a face mask and avoid public places where you can spread the disease to others. Small children having flu symptoms should be kept at home until the symptoms subside.   All those who come in contact with the virus do not develop symptoms, explained the doctor. The majority would have no symptoms at all while the others would develop symptom ranging from a mild disease to pneumonia. Those who are at the extremes of age, Children under 2 years of age and elderly over 65 years of age, are more likely to develop a  severe illness. Among these children, those having chronic diseases or diseases in organs like the heart or the kidneys are more susceptible. Pregnant women as well as adults, who are suffering from chronic illnesses and having weakened immune systems, are also more vulnerable. If a person belongs to the above categories, it’s important to seek medical attention as soon as the symptoms appear, cautioned Dr. Gunathilake. Patients who are having high fever or respiratory difficulty at any stage of the disease need to seek urgent medical care, he advised.   Whenever a person develops a cough and cold, and even if it’s a viral illness, patients expect antibiotics to be prescribed. They demand antibiotics from the doctor or sometimes self-medicate themselves after obtaining medicine from pharmacies.Patients who are having mild symptoms can usually be safely managed at home with adequate hydration bed rest and paracetamol being given for the fever, said the doctor.   “Secondary Infections cause more harm than influenza”The majority of those who are aware and taking precautions against influenza believe that it’s the primary disease or the influenza that causes severe illness and death in patients. This is not so, according to the many specialists that the Daily Mirror consulted. All of them agree that while influenza can sometimes cause pneumonia and other severe disease, it’s usually the secondary bacterial infections that arrive after developing pneumonia which causes more harm to the patients.   “Damage caused to the respiratory tract by the influenza virus makes it easier for the other bacteria to enter and cause infections, explained Dr. Gunathilake, further stating that these can be more difficult to manage than the virus itself. Therefore he cautioned patients to be on the lookout for secondary infections after a viral infection of the respiratory tract. “These infections usually appear as fever reappearing 4/5 days after subsiding of other symptoms”, he commented.   ‘‘Lack of guidance on how to address the present situation’’D. D. K. Wickra,chchi Matara Divisional Secretary When inquired into the initiatives taken by the Government to address the current health problem in the country, Matara Divisional Secretary D. D. K. Wickramaarachchi said that the Government had taken measures to close the primary schools with the onset of the viral flu. These schools were scheduled to be reopened yesterday (May 30). According to Wickramaarachchi, classroom sessions were conducted as usual for students in other grades although a significant drop was witnessed in the number of students who were present. “Plying along the Pasgoda, Kotapola and Kamburupitiya roads, I noticed that there were only around four to five students in school vans that can usually accommodate around twenty. These were students who were returning  home from school and the number was very low compared to the number of students one may observe in a school van on a regular day.   There is a general fear in sending children to school under the prevailing situation. It has reached a point where the Karapitiya Hospital is no longer receiving additional child patients to the children’s ward in the hospital. My personal view on the matter is that it’s better to close the schools at least until the health authorities issue an official announcement, stating that the prevailing disease situation has been brought under control in the country. To my knowledge, I believe that the Ministry of Health has still not made any official statement regarding the disease. However, it should be noted that even in Matara, there is a general fear that the disease might spread. Currently we are facing a problem due to the lack of proper guidance on how to address the present situation” Wickramaarachchi said.   “The Ministry’s silence is causing undue panic among the citizens”  Stating that there are five main hospitals in the south comprising the main hospitals of Karapitiya Teaching Hospital in Galle, the Teaching Hospital in Maha Modara, General Hospital in Matara, Labima Hospital in Kotawila and the District General Hospital in Hambanthota, Wickramaarachchi continued that statistically, it is difficult to assume how many patients with the virus have been admitted to these hospitals. “Also, it is certainly not within my purview or knowledge to statistically determine the number of patients currently admitted to the hospitals for treatment. Nevertheless, children have been advised to wear a mask to avoid contracting the disease. But, it’s equally important to ensure that these masks are worn by them in the correct manner to avoid the spread of the disease. On the other hand, there is speculation that the influenza disease might spread again in the months of July and August although this needs to be verified since the information is coming from unofficial sources. Also, given that this is the rainy season, now there prevails a risk of dengue spreading in the locality. As a country, we have not impressed enough weight on this matter despite it being a burning social issue that needs to be addressed immediately” he concluded.   "
"Sri Lanka’s critical care speciality  not evolving","2018-05-25 02:37:55							0						 				2107"," Medical specialities evolve for the benefit of patients. It resolves the demand and enhances clinical effectiveness.We are duty bound to support this evolution and create specialist services to serve the need.Quality healthcare is based on this concept and it is patient-centred, not provider centric. Accordingly, doctor training pathways need modification with relevant competencies to produce specialists with matching new skills.Such doctors are traditionally board certified as specialists via an ‘exit’ examination (MD) to achieve a minimum national standard or benchmark. Today, board certification of critical care specialists in Sri Lanka has no ‘exit’ examination, but is primarily testimonials based. This needs urgent redress.   The impetus for the formation of a specialty board for critical care medicine in 2008 under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses of the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) was the plight of junior medical officers serving in intensive care units. The aim was to develop critical care medicine training with multi-disciplinary professional input. After much thought and discussion, a diploma critical care medicine curriculum (DCCM) was installed in 2009 based on the CoBaTrICE model (An International Competency Based Training programme in Intensive Care Medicine for Europe and other world regions) as a stepping stone for a higher degree in Critical Care i.e. MD. The DCCM training programme was of high intensity (60 credits) and matched level 10 of Sri Lanka Quality Framework (SLQF). A world renowned critical care specialist was present as an examiner.   A ‘standard’ and an ‘alternate’ pathway for the transition period were proposed in 2011. This ‘alternate’ pathway allowed anaesthetists practising critical care medicine to continue to do so and enter a trainee tailored training programme until the country produced a sufficient number of MD qualified critical care specialists via the ‘standard’ pathway. This model was approved by the Senate of the University of Colombo. The purpose was to create an independent ‘standard’ training programme for Critical Care Medicine and phase out the ‘alternate’ pathway by 2016.   In 2011, the College of Anesthesiologists took over the reins of this training programme virtually by force and the Board of Study in Anaesthesiology (BOS-A) saw its responsibilities being sanctioned for 1 year by the PGIM in the first instance. But they continued regardless. Sadly, for the past 8 years, no action has been taken to promote the ‘standard pathway’ of training. The above diplomats were neither given an opportunity to take up appropriate leadership roles to shape up critical care services in Sri Lanka nor was a window opened for them for further training for MD. As a direct consequence, many of the diplomats migrated and became consultant critical care specialists elsewhere. The exodus was inevitable. The PGIM failed in its duties to the trainees and public alike.   Scrapping of diploma programmeInstead of promoting this training program, the College of Anaesthetists decided to do away with the diploma programme by demoting its value and removed its foreign examiner. It decided to hold onto the ‘alternate’ pathway of training as the final destination to critical care specialisation. Repeated requests by the Ministry of Health to install the ‘standard’ training pathway fell on deaf ears. The Ministry of Health, the biggest employer of doctors in Sri Lanka, desperately wanted the above diplomats with intermediate training in Critical Care to maintain a credible intensive care service in its hospitals.The lack of recognition of the problem and the inability to rectify the issues raised make the current specialty board in critical care medicine, hosted within the BOS-A, not fit for its purpose. If no action is taken, the DCCM would have no trainee applicants and specialty development of Critical Care Medicine in Sri Lanka will see a natural demise. In order to conceal this diverse interest, dual board certification in critical care medicine was offered to anesthetists. This self-served privilege was proposed, scrutinised and approved by the same board of study (BOS-A) constituted of only anesthetists. No ‘exit’ examination on critical care medicine was necessary.   In the PGIM, competence-based training pathways exist similar to DCCM. Ironically, anesthesia is one of them. In its training, the BOS-Ahas hosted a Part 1 A (a clinical practice-based examination) at the end of the 1st year of training followed by a Part 1 B, a theory test and the final Part 2 MD as its exit examination for decades. Thus,BOS-Ais fully aware of the need of basic clinical competence training for the junior members practicing anesthesia, but denies the same for critical care. Modern critical care is not a speciality that can be remotely managed from home or whilst engaged in another job in the operating theatre. The patient outcomes in critical care heavily depends on the presence of highly trained doctors and nurses on-site (24/7) and capable of recognising and rectifying deteriorating trends and mishaps long before irreversible damage is done.   PGIM and evolving needs Both critical care medicine and emergency medicine were recommended to be accepted as separate specialities in Sri Lanka by the then Minister of Health, the current President Maithripala Sirisena in 2011 following a review of its timely need. The University of Colombo hosts the only Institute of Post Graduate medical training in this country. Therefore, as a public funded organisation, the PGIM is obliged to shape up its training programs to serve the evolving needs of the Ministry of Health that serves all citizens of Sri Lanka.   Every clinical specialty encounters disease conditions that would need intensive care. Therefore, every clinician has a right to participate in the care of their patients, in a critically ill state, to resolve therapies of the original illness. A majority of patients needing critical care services have coexisting medical and surgical problems. Thus, multi-disciplinary inputs are essential to direct training until critical care specialists are produced.   Medicine evolves with time. When Hippocrates initiated medicine as a profession, there were no specialities. Specialities evolved to enhance care for patients and improve outcomes. Thus, the sole purpose of generation of specialities is natural, initially born as a sub-specialty of a parent specialty and then raised to become independent with time with greater experience in its development. For example, there were no paediatricians in 1970’s, but they evolved from adult physicians. In 1990s it was clear that paediatricians could not offer the best services for neonates and hence neonatologists emerged. Although paediatricians were nurtured initially by the College of Physicians, they claim no ownership of paediatrics as a sub-specialty. A similar pathway of development will have to be followed for critical care medicine.   The evolution of critical care medicine in the world began with the concentration of essential equipment and staff in one place of the hospital to serve the most sick patients; a concept first initiated by Florence Nightingale in 1850’s. In 1950’s with a polio epidemic in Denmark, mechanical ventilation was instituted and quite rightly anesthetists had a major role to play. However, with evolution of medicine it became clear that critical care needs new skills to improve the outcome of patients.   The historical contribution by the College of Anaesthetists for the development of critical care medicine should be celebrated, as well as their continued involvement to produce trained future specialists in critical care. This is because some transferable skills of anaesthesia are needed for critical care specialist training. Critical Care specialists encompass other skills and competencies including the ability to lead a team of multi-professional doctors for the benefit of critically ill patients. Multi-organ failure resulting from dengue is one such example. Several recent media reports involving VIPs allude to the consequences of lack of team work.   The very fact that the Sri Lanka College of Anaesthesiologists denial of  the need for multi-professional input to critical care medicine development is testimony to its intentions to delay its progress to become an independent specialty in this country, but why? It is also unfair that a junior doctor is expected to complete his training in anaesthetics as enforced by the BOS-A to be able to commence training in critical care. This is not dissimilar from demanding compulsory training to be a ‘cricketer’ before becoming eligible to be a trainee ‘rugby player’ just because cricketers’ training pathway had a transferable skill such as running.   DCCM Examination It is also surprising that PGIM has allowed board certification of a ‘specialty’ for such a long time with no ‘exit’ examination in its training pathway. The only credible critical care specialty-based examination held by the PGIM to date is the DCCM which is more comprehensive and detailed than any contained in anaesthesia prospectuses. In fact, the diploma holders have undergone the exact duration of critical care medicine training to that of post MD anaesthesia trainees who have become eligible for board certification in critical care without a single ‘exit’ examination in critical care medicine.   Critical Care Medicine already has established sub-specialities in cardiac, neuro, paediatric, renal and liver care in developed countries, and is usually primary disease oriented, and maintains inputs from primary referring specialists. A critical care specialist predominantly focuses on establishing (resuscitation) and maintaining adequate vital organ function by means of pharmacological, physiological, or artificial manipulation or replacement therapy. The primary aim of such stabilisation and maintenance of vital functions is to borrow time in life for natural healing process to take place assisted by the specific therapies instituted by relevant specialists until sustainable organ function has returned naturally or via artificial support of organs or following transplantation.   In the UK, for example, intensive care medicine (ICM), now termed critical care medicine, achieved specialty status in 1999. In the early 1990’s the foundation of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine was by seven parent colleges. This new faculty wasn’t a destination, but was a starting point to establish Critical Care Medicine as a separate specialty. In 1992, the Royal Colleges in the UK formed the Joint Advisory Committee for Intensive Therapy and this became the Intercollegiate Board for Training in ICM in 1996. This was very similar to the establishment of a Specialty Board in Critical Care Medicine under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses in 2008 in Sri Lanka, but sadly moved away for sole management by BOS-A in 2011. This has effectively denounced the need for development of a multidisciplinary professional identity in critical care training in Sri Lanka.   In January 2011, the General Medical Council (GMC) required Faculty of ICM-UK to develop a primary specialty training programme for ICM, a fact that the Sri Lankan College of Anaesthesiologists ignore to be in existence. Instead, the Sri Lanka College of Anaesthesiologists renamed themselves to include intensive care in 2014 without committing to the essential pillars needed for critical care medicine development. In contrast to the GMC, the Sri Lanka Medical Council remains silent.   I hope wisdom will prevail in this ongoing saga. It’s our responsibility to ensure that a safe, effective, efficient, well-led service is delivered to the public through the maintenance of the highest standards of training. Specialty formation should be to achieve the above for patients and not to retain territorial boundaries for provider gain. Moving the Speciality Board for Critical Care Medicine to be hosted under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses shall mark a new beginning. (The writer is a Professor of Anaesthesiology (2002-2013) from the University of Peradeniya and can be reached via E mail cgoonase@sltnet.lk)Acknowledgement: Mahes Salgado for manuscript assistance.   "
"Sugar puts Tea industry in a dilemma","2018-05-23 00:00:47							0						 				5638","''WE WANTED TO CONDUCT THIS TEST SECRETLY"" It was last February that the story of 53 tea factories, which allegedly adulterate tea with sugar during production, was revealed. The raids on these tea factories had been carried out by the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB). The Minister of Plantation Industries of Sri Lanka Navin Dissanayake said that any culprits found guilty would be punished severely. This was revealed through ‘Sathya Gaveshana’ ( Exploration into the truth) an expos article which appeared in our sister newspaper ..Lankadeepa. But, the SLTB has to now check whether it adhered to the proper procedures when doing its research. When it comes to regulations relevant to the tea industry, why does the SLTB, being the legal authority, become so powerless? This week’s exploration is about the much talked about story in the tea industry. This investigation, that was done under the leadership of the former SLTB Chairman Rohan Pethiyagoda, is the first of its kind in the history of Sri Lanka tea. However, he retired from service one month after this investigation; termed as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The position he vacated was filled by Lusil Wijewardena, no stranger to the tea industry. He was entrusted with the task of taking action against the allegations levelled against the 53 tea factories. But there emerged another problem because the alleged factory owners’ stand was that they aren’t guilty.Minister Dissanayake said no quick decisions could be made and it would take about three months before arriving at a conclusionThey have taken steps to challenge the investigation, said to have been done in keeping with a pure scientific method. The minister in charge later afforded an opportunity to the factory owners to express their views. Accordingly, the minister had a discussion on March 29 with the these tea factory owners and the officers of the SLTB. As a result, these factory owners got the opportunity to express their views in writing. But the SLTB encountered an unexpected situation; they had to verify the outcome of the investigation they had already carried out.   In the meantime Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti made a written request to Minister Dissanayake to publish the relevant list of factory owners alleged to have adulterated the tea during manufacturing. His request was to reveal at least the names of 27 factory owners among the 80 factories who have produced tea by reasonable means. When inquired by journalists, a senior officer of the SLTB said that it was not possible to reveal the names of those concerned because no final decision had been arrived at thus far.   However, Pethiyagoda, who was in the forefront of this investigation, is no more with the SLTB. The tea board does not seem to be interested in the relevant research methodology as well. When journalists made inquiries in this regard, Minister Dissanayake said no quick decisions could be made and it would take about three months before arriving at a conclusion. This scenario highlights a negative aspect associated with the tea board. The SLTB has a research institute as well and should be in a position to take responsibility with whatever activities it carries out. The counter allegations made by these factory owners have been aimed at distorting the truth. If this is how the SLTB takes responsibility it’s no shock to see that ‘Ceylon tea’ has become a subject of controversy.   When it comes to the tea industry there are many processes which are connected to it. For instance a number of activities such as tea production, export, brokerage, import and packing are involved in the tea industry. In the event of stemming a defect associated with any process, it is inevitable that the entire tea industry will be affected adversely. Given the present crisis it seems that contributions have been made by the tea plucker to the labourer to intensify the problem in the tea industry. The Tea Small Holders’ Association claims that it is dumped in a chaotic situation when there is a tug-of-war between the SLTB and the tea factory owners. According to them, the main reason for this competition in the market is that despite there being an increase in the number of tea factories it has not been in proportion with the production which has remained low. In reality it is the tea small holders who are in danger because they have to see to the welfare of 2 million dependents. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the authorities to take note of their grievances.   There are various differences of opinion among the business community and the groups who are connected to this industry. These differences were highlighted in the media. However much of these differences are associated with wrong opinions, which have led to arguments. The best example for this is the tea board of neighbouring India. The Tea Board of India (TBI) acts as a facilitator to help people identify real tea from the tea that has been adulterated with colouring. In this aspect the TBI adheres to a rigid policy. Various strategies have been introduced to identify the real products. These strategies not only help the consumer to avoid buying bogus products but also assists the authorities to nab the culprits. They publish newspaper advertisements in this regard. India in comparison to Sri Lanka reveals the truth about the team that’s produced in her country. India makes it a point to make it known to consumers that the future of a tea brand depends solely on honesty and trustworthiness.   It was last year that the tea industry in Sri Lanka celebrated its 150th Anniversary. But, the negative news about the defects in the island’s tea has spoiled the anniversary celebrations. Sri Lanka should not forget that it is facing a challenging situation when other players in the tea market like Kenya and India are doing well. Sri Lankan tea is bought by countries like Russia, Iraq and Iran. It is not very healthy for the SLTB to take such an irresponsible stand because there are so many dependents. It should reveal the truth about the wrong doing of the factory or otherwise accept defeat. If this isn’t done it is the ‘Ceylon Tea’ brand name that’ll suffer because as of now the country’s tea is termed ‘impure’. This is a time when the entire tea industry must remember that old Sinhalese saying, ‘an act of washing clothes and dipping them again in muddy waters’.   ‘Cultivators are in trouble’ - Kularatna Association of All Ceylon Tea Development Small Tea Estates Alliance   Chairman K.L. Kularatna said that tea is presented to the world saying it’s ‘Pure Ceylon Tea’.  “It will damage to the reputation of tea. This is an industry which paves the way to earn the living of 2 million people. There may be only six hundred factory owners. They are engaged in unnecessary competition to earn profits. Now they have a harvest of about three to four hundred kilos from each acre.This is not sufficient. Factories are increased while the production of tea is going down. Then the tender leaves are not sufficient to meet the capacity of the factory. Then they make various methods to increase production. Small tea owners are doing this for their living. We are in trouble due to the work of this small group. Most of the investors are local people who have invested more money on this tea industry.Tea factory owners can change this business, but we can’t do it. We are experiencing  a major crisis. “We wanted to conduct this test secretly”    The following are excerpts of an interview done with the former Chairman of Sri Lanka Tea Board Rohan Pethiyagoda.   Q What sort of test was conducted by SLTB in connection with blending tea with sugar?   The issue of tea being mixed with sugar has been prevalent for sometime. I thought of a new method to verify the truth of this charge in a quick way without waiting for the processing of the black tea. Various properties of sugar are subject to several chemical changes during heating. Any difference detected in the tea leaves during the process of drying, after grinding, proves that the tea has been mixed with sugar. But some were of the view that this test could be done only with black tea and it didn’t surface in the mind of anyone that this test could be easily done at the factory premises. When tea leaves are put in water before they are put in the oven at the factory, the tea begins to dilute and will taste sweet, if sugar has been added. This is a simple and easy method of testing whether there is sugar in tea.   Q But the alleged factory owners maintain that sugar, to a certain degree, is an inherent property of tea itself. How do you explain this view?   It’s true that sugar is naturally found in tea leaves and also in other kinds of leaves. But this sugar is present in fructose form and includes glucose and sucrose. This is less than one percent of the sugar which is produced by the leaf itself. However there is no possibility of increasing this minute degree of sugar during the drying and grinding stages.   We deployed them in groups of two according to the list of factories. Instructions were given to take samples and transport them in cabs while keeping the mobile phones off. What was happening was not known to them - Rohan PethiyagodaQ There is another allegation that this test has been conducted without the direct involvement of SLTB.Your comments.   We wanted to conduct this test secretly. We didn’t even use the SLTB’s vehicles as drivers would come to know about our task. This would have made the factory staff take every precaution to stop their misconducts. I made arrangements to bring the relevant officers to the auditorium of the Tea Research Institute in Kottawa, Galle by inviting them to a so-called farewell party on my retirement from the SLTB.   We deployed them in groups of two according to the list of factories. Instructions were given to take samples and transport them in cabs while keeping the mobile phones off. What was happening was not known to them.   If they had known about our purpose their abuses in the processing of tea would not have been detected.   Q  Why is sugar added in the processing of tea?   Ferrous sulfate, potassium permanganate, sodium hydroxide and sugar are added to give a black colour to the tea. Black tea is expensive and Arabian countries prefer this type of tea. Normally processed tea is grayish in colour. The other thing is that sugar helps in the process of fine grinding. The third factor is the weight. A kilo of sugar costs only Rs.100 while a kilo of tea is Rs 600-700.   Q Some accept that they mix sugar with tea and also argue that there is no harm in this blending process.   A scientist at the Tea Research Institute (TRI) in 1971 prescribed as acceptable a small amount of sugar to be mixed with the tea. This was included in a research paper. However some factory owners have taken it as a recommendation of the TRI. There are easy and profitable ways of manufacturing tea. But it should comply with the legal requirements.We assure the quality of our tea when dealing with the international market. If the real sate of our tea is revealed it will badly affect the produce from Sri Lanka. Other main exporters like India and Kenya follow strict procedures in the operating of their tea industries.   The mixed tea tends to develop a certain fungus three months after the tea auctions and becomes unsalable. These factory owners should realise that they are causing a bad global impression when they do this to our tea.   Q TRI is preparing to do a review of this particular test. Do you agree to such a review?   For our tests we brought down samples of withered tea leaves and leaves of the later stages to Colombo. These samples were brought by the tea inspectors employed under the Commissioner of Tea. They were sealed and signed samples and were also given to the factory owners to avoid any possible disputes.Therefore the allegation of blending tea in Colombo is not true. There was transparency when these tests were done. If there is any suspicion a sample could be retested. Private Tea Factory Owners’ Association behind issue   Following are excerpts of an interview done with a factory owner who is shrouded in allegations.Q What happened really?   That is the general methodology used by SLTB. We are harassed first and then slapped with a fine of Rs.50,000 or 100,000. The factory owners pay the fine because they can’t bear the oppression. The SLTB is an institution where bureaucracy reigns supreme. The main question is whether they have done this to stop the malpractices in the tea industry or whether their aim is to be in the good books of the Minister. Even the officers of the SLTB aren’t aware of this methodology. Opinion is divided within the SLTB itself.   Q  But, hasn’t it been proved that tea is adulterated with sugar?   The sugar level in the tea may fluctuate due to the climate, fertilizer and manner in which tea leaves are plucked. It is practically difficult to prepare a baseline. On the other hand, the chemical composition in tea differs from the places where the leaves are plucked. Tea leaves are put into the dryer after 2 hours of withering and rolling. No recent study has been done in this regard. The SLTB proved that the glucose content is more in the rolled leaf than in the withered one. These claims aren’t scientific because the carbohydrate content increases as soon as the leaf is put in the roller. The HPLC methodology is only a reading.   The SLTB should get involved in this and find out what’s happening. There is a big problem of labour in Sri Lanka - A factory ownerQ  More or less, sugar in the tea may appear as fructose and glucose whereas there may be a slight presence of sucrose. Do you support the argument that there is no reason to increase the natural sugar content while drying and grinding tea leaf?   That is wrong. There is ample evidence of research to prove it. This person who is making this claim has no knowledge about botany. If that is so, this person should do a research and prove it. Really, the former chairman wanted to show that he is a big shot.   Q  Do you accept the suggestion that the sealed tea sample test can dispel doubts?   That is useless. For instance the average value of blood samples should be known to see whether there is dengue. Comparisons are done like that. Here, there is no average value to be compared. What are here are his dimensions. That is not a definition.   Q Are there people who adulterate tea with sugar?   Yes. We have to find out why do they do so? The quality of the Sri Lanka tea is gradually declining. The SLTB should get involved in this and find out what’s happening. There is a big problem of labour in Sri Lanka. The people in the past plucked tea leaf every five days. Later these figures changed from seven to ten days. If mature leaf is adulterated with sugar then it will become wet. When we get 25 kgs. of plucked tea leaves by paying 6 dollars, the countries like Kenya pay 1 dollar and get 60 kgs of plucked leaves. It is useless boasting about ‘Ceylon Tea’ without having a means to survive.The SLTB is an institution where bureaucracy reigns supreme. The main question is whether they have done this to stop the malpractices in the tea industry or whether their aim is to be in the good books of the Minister. - A factory ownerQ  Do you say that there is no problem in mixing tea with sugar?   Really, there is no problem. Even though sugar is mixed, it will not remain as we boil the tea in a high temperature. For instance, this is not an act similar to mixing brick dust with chili powder. On the other hand, all types of chemicals are sprayed in the growing process until the tea leaves are brought to the factory after plucking. If there is nothing like that there is no need for the tea board to intervene. It is the ‘Brahman’ caste or the Private Tea Factory Owners’ Association which is behind this. In the chairman’s factory, 15,000 kgs of tea is not produced per month. Their factories are closing down on a daily basis. They who are unable to face the competition and are trying to close the biggest factories in Sri Lanka.   Q  What did you demand from Prime Minister?   To start a scholarly discussion including the tea board and factory owners. We also asked to conduct a research with the Tea Research Institute. Now there are bogus tea plants all over Sri Lanka. The Tea Board must be committed to start genuine tea nurseries. But, they do not address these real problems.  ‘It is baseless to make allegations’ - Ranasinghe  Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association Chairman Harith Ranasinghe said that if sugar is mixed with tea, the weight and color change resulting in extra profits. “Then they can overcome others. Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association is not going behind anyone. The Minister was informed in one voice by the Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association to inquire into this as it is a disgrace to the name of Sri Lanka Tea, if such a things are happening,” he said.  ‘Methodology needs to be examined’ - EdirisingheTea Commissioner E.A.J.K Edirisinghe said that all 53 factories have already submitted reports on the production process of their factories. They are now being studied by the Tea Board. Their main concern is about the methodology applied by the Tea Board in the testing process. Therefore we are now reviewing our testing methodology.     "

"At the end point of  tolerance","2018-05-09 00:00:24							0						 				737","Battered Meethotamulla residents demand their landsThe time was not at all auspicious for residents of Meethotamulla area back in 2017 on April 14th when the entire country was getting ready to welcome the Sinhala and Hindu New year. The garbage mount which covers a vast area collapsed without leaving a trace of property and 31 lives.   The Meethotamulla garbage mount received the attention of authorities in January, 2013 when Meethotamulla Sri Rahula Vidyalaya closed down. From then many protests were staged urging the authorities to halt garbage dumping in the area. At that time around 800 tons of garbage was dumped daily in the area which covers approximately 17 Acres.   The residents pointed out that it was a tragedy which could have been prevented. Under the Supreme Court order SCFR 218/2009 the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) had limited authority to dump garbage. However, contrary to the order, CMC continued to dump garbage in this area.   Despite the many campaigns held with the aim of eradicating dengue none of them was applicable to Meethotamulla. The area was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and there were many residents who contracted dengue. Residents in the area suffering from skin diseases and respiratory issues was common. Irrespective of the number of pleas, protests and the campaigns the authorities turned blind eye to the issue.   The loss of lives in April 2017 was an eye-opener to many. Some lives had to be sacrificed for the authorities to notice the issue and put a stop to the permanent dumping of garbage in Meethotamulla.   A year has passed and there are residents in this area without homes. This is despite promises made to them by the authorities.    Shantha Jayasinghe, a resident who lost his house and vehicle due to the collapse of the garbage mount, said that he was born and bred in the area and that the residents possessed deeds for the land they lived on. “We are not illegal residents despite some of the Media saying so” he said.   He said that an estimate of forty Lakhs was made for the houses, but no estimate had been made so far regarding the value of the land.   Housing in flats   The residents said that they were given Rs. 50,000 per month as a rent for three months. But this payment was halted after August 2017. During this period some of the residents were evacuated as they were living in areas which were identified as danger zones. Also some of the residents were evacuated considering the fact their houses were half or fully damaged. Some even got housing in flats.   They point out that the basis of the valuation is not fair. And they again had to make requests regarding the balance payments.   “We had to go to Divisional Secretariat requesting for the balance of the compensation. Following a few meetings and requests being made, arrangements were made to give us the money due from August 2017,” the residents said.   The garbage mount still stands tall. The monument gives the indication that it is trying to relate a story about a section of the society that has been battered and betrayedKapila Perera, another resident who lost his house, said that there is another sect of residents who didn’t receive compensation. “Yes, we managed to receive compensation, but there are some residents who didn’t receive anything. There are residents who do not have title deeds, but a card instead which was given during the period of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa. But this card is not accepted anywhere nor is any guidance given to those residents,” he complained.    Perera further said that although the media portray that 90% of the issues of the residents were solved this news is far from the reality.   Fighting for what they deserve   “It is indeed sad how some of the media portrayed this whole incident. Some of the people got the idea that the collapse of the garbage mount was a blessing in disguise as some residents got houses in flats. This is not true. We were left only with what we wore at that moment. Since then life has been a constant battle. We have not been given a permanent solution for the housing issue. We have to fight even to get what we deserve,” he said.   The residents said that none of the Members of Parliament who represented the area followed up what had happened after the collapse of the dump. Adding to their woes none of the Non Governmental Organizations approached them to offer help. They live in constant fear as to what would happen next.   “Many promises were made. One of the promises made was to make this a green zone, but nothing has been done even after the lapse of a year. There is no plan for the next step. True, now they do not dump garbage here, but what are they going to do to the mount? It is still there. Sri Rahula Vidyalaya is still closed. Our Children faced not only health issues, but also had to deal with social concerns. Once the school was closed they were given new schools but were looked down by other students,” they said. They said that compared to other similar situations that developed in the country they were not offered any help to uplift their mental status.   “When other disasters struck the country many steps were taken on behalf of the people’s welfare. During past disasters there was also psychological support for those affected. There were children who were to sit for the Grade five Scholarship Examination. This is one opportunity which a child gets to join a school that offers better facilities. After the devastation the children could not perform at the exam in keeping with expectations as they did not have books nor other psychological support. As parents we could not support them as we too were devastated at that time,” they said.    The residents further said that if they aren’t provided with a reasonable solution by the Government the only option they have is to return to the area close to the garbage mount and build houses.“We were born and bred here. All our lives evolved here. If the Government is not going to dump garbage they can clear the area, improve infrastructure and give the lands back to the residents,” the residents said.   Furthermore they said that although a committee had been set up, the only action taken so far was the removing of the Commissioner of the CMC.   “It is not just the Commissioner who should be responsible for this. There were many people who are responsible. What is the use of removing just one official? It does not make any difference to our lives” the residents argued.   The garbage mount still stands tall. The monument gives the indication that it is trying to relate a story about a section of the society that has been battered and betrayed.    When the Daily Mirror contacted Navin Mannapperuma, Director Western Province Waste Management Authority, he said that measures had been taken to make the garbage mount less active. “There are many garbage mounts like these in the world. Although many claim that the garbage here can be recycled, in reality we cannot use the entire mount for that purpose. What can be done is to make it inactive. There is a plan executed by University of Moratuwa along with the Ministry of Megapolis with regard to Meethotamulla,” he said.     "
"March tourist arrivals up 24% despite communal clashes","2018-04-10 00:00:27							0						 				2538"," Despite the communal clashes that unsettled Sri Lanka’s hill country during the first two weeks of March, the tourist arrivals to the island nation in the same month grew 24.1 percent to 233,382, the data released by Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) showed. However, this strong growth comes from a low base last year, due to the partial closure of the country’s main airport in Katunayake.According to the SLTDA, Europe continued to be the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka, accounting for 53 percent of the total arrivals received in March 2018. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 38 percent of the total traffic, America 7 percent, Middle East one percent and Africa one percent.  India, the United Kingdom, Germany, China and France were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist-generating markets during March.  India was the largest source of tourist traffic with 13 percent of the total traffic received in March. The United Kingdom also accounted for 13 percent of the total traffic, while Germany, China and France accounted for 11 percent, 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively.   Tourist arrivals from India during March rose 13 percent year-on-year (YoY) to 30,583, while arrivals from the United Kingdom rose 56.1 percent YoY to 30,366. Visitors from Germany rose 60.6 percent YoY to 24,423, while from France the arrivals rose 29 percent YoY to 14,818.Tourist arrivals from China fell 4.8 percent to 21,101.An analysis of arrivals by regions showed Europe leading the pack with 124,144 tourists during March, recording a growth of 44.5 percent YoY.Arrivals from Asia and the Pacific edged up 2.2 percent YoY to 88,299, while arrivals from the Americas rose 61 percent YoY 16,006.Tourists from Oceania, which includes Australia and New Zealand, rose 58.2 percent YoY to 9,966. Visitors from the Middle East fell 26.6 percent YoY to 3,520, which could be directly attributed to the communal violence prevailed during the early weeks of the month.To tame the violence that erupted between the extremist factions of Sinhala and Muslim communities, the government had to declare a state of emergency and ordered a social media blackout, which lasted almost a week, even after the hostilities ended.  Due to the police curfew that prevailed, the tourists in Kandy were trapped in their hotels and had to use their passports as curfew passes to leave the area. However, there were no reports of any tourist being harmed.   Meanwhile, on a cumulative basis, tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka in the first quarter of 2018 rose 17.1 percent YoY to 707, 924.Sri Lanka achieved 2.1 million tourists in 2017 despite the partial closure of the country’s main airport for about three months. The floods and the dengue epidemic also contributed to the lower than expected arrivals. The government aims to attract three million tourists this year.  "
"Sri Jayewardenepura Uni organises ‘Strangers 2018’ The biggest adventure in life is to","2018-04-06 01:01:22							0						 				1600","Life is either a great adventure or nothing, yet the biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. While walking through the paths of life we come cross many strangers.   “Strangers” is a leadership programme with adventurous games and activities organized by the Marketing Management Association (MMA) of the Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce (FMSC) of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura (USJP). The Strangers is the only Sri Lankan inter-university room organized by a single department.  The Strangers has its origins back to the year 2013. This event is exclusively for the first year students of the FMSC with the prime inception of strengthening friendly bonds among the fresh blood. While enriching their inspiration, motivation and a pinch of creativity and imagination, it provides a useful opportunity where one can learn and experience the fun of competing and team spirit.  Accordingly, with the prime intention of strengthening tomorrow’s leadership by improving mental and physical fitness along with promoting good health and well-being, the programme, ‘Strangers’ assist the participants to be fully equipped with knowledge, skills and attitudes. Strangers commenced its opening ceremony on the 11th of June 2015 at the Kasa Gas Sewana of the USJP, with the participation of students from both local and foreign universities, several Sri Lankan artistes along with the other distinguished guests from the university, and the corporate sector.   Strangers 2013 led off with the inauguration ceremony at the kasa gas sewana of USJP for the fourth time, with a magnificent step forward by opening up the romping adventure game to corporate members. Participants were clustered into ten groups. The adventurous game began and was conducted in Belihuloya and Ella for three days at a stretch, followed by a grand awarding ceremony.  The Strangers is an extraordinary opportunity to build Sri Lankan tourism, and most importantly, ‘Strangers’ engages in various activities. Last year Strangers shouldered a special project regarding Dengue prevention and awareness. This year, Strangers 2018 is  looking forward to launching many more innovative projects.   For further information contact - Vimukthi 0710555809 "

"Rosy Senanayake believes Colombo could be better than Malaysia","2018-03-29 00:00:01							26						 				19071","Colombo’s first female Mayor Rosy Senanayake assumed duties last week and is in the process of ‘setting things right’ at the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). During the run-up to the elections, Senanayake presented an elaborate manifesto addressing various issues in and around Colombo. One of her primary focuses includes developing underserved development areas. “The beauty of Colombo is that it’s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city,” she said in an interview with the Daily Mirror. Excerpts:  	We are contracted to provide 700 metric tonnes of mixed garbage for this project by August 2019	The Govt. has identified Aruwakkalu as a permanent dumping place	The Govt. is in the process of streamlining the property registration process in the CMC	We have a waste-to-energy project which the Municipality has signed with a private entity	Social welfare projects would be concentrated 100% on these underserved development areas  Q  What are the immediate challenges that you have faced and would address in the near future?We have actually looked at a few (challenges), but garbage remains our number one priority. We had a meeting with the Prime Minister last week because we faced a crisis situation since the authorities at Muthurajawela stopped collecting mixed waste. We then had to negotiate with the Minister and within 48 hours we dumped the collection. I also believe that the residents have a responsibility in segregating the garbage. I have informed the Municipality to educate the residents because they cannot haphazardly dispose of garbage. We have a waste-to-energy project which the Municipality has signed with a private entity which would get off the ground by the end of 2019. A meeting was held and this will continue every month to see how far they have progressed. We are contracted to provide 700 metric tonnes of mixed garbage for this project by August 2019. By then I believe that most of our problems would be solved given that this project takes off.   In the past, the Governments had not realized how waste could be a money-spinner. There are many facets and uses of waste. We also have had discussions to improve the health and sanitation sector next. The dengue mosquito and the epidemic normally happen in a cycle of twice every year. So we are getting ready to minimize the effects of breeding grounds. The Government is in the process of streamlining the property registration process in the CMC. The project spearheaded by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade is aimed at enhancing investment climate and paving the way for taxpayers to receive an efficient service at comparatively less cost. For this there are three stakeholders namely the Registrar General’s Office, the CMC and the Survey Department. We just signed the MoU with them. For the time being it’s a manual process and earlier to register the property in Colombo it took more than 30 days. The MoU will enable us to share information among all stakeholders. We are also preparing for Vesak.As Sri Lankans we need to celebrate all festivals. The beauty of Colombo is that it’s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city and we have always lived in harmony no matter what happens in the rest of the country. Hence, we have co-existed and therefore we need to celebrate each one’s cultural background and customs. There will be open houses and the municipality will encourage co-existence among different cultural communities. We are looking at the housing, underserved settlements and their needs etc.   We have already appointed a committee to empower women and look into their needs and bring in multi-serving and multi-purpose community centres Q  The CMC was in the news for several incidents related to bribery and corruption. How would you streamline the activities within the Council? Firstly it is about bringing in e-governance and instilling discipline in the Council. I’m also working on a mechanism to bring everyone to work, hence improving the quality of work. I also need to establish a Human Resource Department because roughly about 9000 people work here and there’s also a need to establish a few departments which are not in existence at the moment. Then we also could look at the social welfare and reward people for the work that they do, give them the incentives to come to work and put the place right. They need to work with the correct frame of mind. If I am to train them on how to think creative and think global and move from where we are then I would do that as well. I strongly believe that Colombo could be better than Singapore or Malaysia. A little bit of effort and leadership is what is needed along with the right mechanism to take this city to heights beyond expectations.   The beauty of Colombo is that it’s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city and we have always lived in harmony no matter what happens in the rest of the country Q  A recent report by a Presidential Commission revealed that the Meethotamulla tragedy was the result of the municipality failing to carry out proper garbage disposal methods. What are your comments? That’s the past and it was beyond my control. I need to study the report and understand the drawbacks. We are looking at the way forward. This is why we had discussions about the waste-to-energy project, consultations with the Megapolis Minister and PM to address the waste issue. In the past, Meethotamulla was a disaster because in order to beautify Colombo, waste was taken and dumped in our neighbour’s garden amidst their protests. These things were done in a haphazard way since the demise of Ranasinghe Premadasa. I don’t think successive Governments had any plans regarding what to do with Colombo’s waste or waste at large around the country.The present Government has identified Aruwakkalu as a permanent dumping place and they are now doing the groundwork. I’m looking at managing and handling Colombo city’s waste from the time I took over. But I would certainly study the report and see where we went wrong. Each ward member will have an App, so the residents of that ward can keep in touch with the member. Therefore ward members could educate their residents and get  them to be more responsible of keeping the city clean. Now that we have 47 wards in the six districts and having 47 ward members, putting in money to those wards to carryout the necessary infrastructure development I’m sure that we would be able to see a stronger and a better Colombo. This is ‘Our Colombo’ as written in my slogan and this city is our responsibility. I’m hoping that the residents would support. My appeal to every member of the Municipality is to support us in our work, irrespective of their parties. Let’s start putting the city first. In the past, the Governments had not realized how waste could be a money-spinner. There are many facets and uses of waste Q  A majority of citizens in Colombo are from underprivileged areas. You have said that the development of these areas will be prioritized. What is your plan? My primary focus even with the 25 multi-purpose community centres is on the underserved areas because 1/3rd of the population lives in those areas. When I spoke about mixed garbage, when people don’t adhere to the norms, they all come from underserved areas. That’s not because they don’t understand or they are not disciplined; it is because they don’t have the provision. A normal house might have space to keep three different bins, but in a watte (A small area where people live), inside a tiny little room with five families I don’t think there’s room to put a bin. Therefore I have been telling the ward members to find a common place in the watte where the municipality can install a garbage disposal system.We need to look at housing, sanitation and water for them. When I spoke about maternity clinics and dispensaries I was addressing the underserved development areas. When it comes to social welfare projects it would be 100% concentrated on these underserved development areas. I had a discussion with a foreign diplomat to establish three vocational training centres and daycare centres because I want to increase the female participation in the labour force. In order to do that I need to develop the infrastructure including affordable day care centres, safe transportation, flexible hours created and so on. We would also be having a daycare for the Municipality. When we improve the lifestyles of people in these areas then major projects such as sewer lines, waste water, drainage and mass scale housing projects will be in our long term development plans.   Each ward member will have an App. Therefore ward members could educate their residents and get  them to be more responsible of keeping the city clean Q  Will future development activities of the city incorporate the ‘wathu’ system or would they be demolished?   It all depends. We still have to consider the availability of land to see the possibility of building houses for them. We have already appointed a committee to empower women and look into their needs and bring in multi-serving and multi-purpose community centres. Most of my plans will be focused on developing underserved development areas.    Q  Many people travel to Colombo daily to engage in work. Those such as tourists visit Colombo for leisure. How would you plan to develop facilities in a way that would benefit those visiting the city?   The residents are approximately 550,000 people whereas about 600,000 migrate on a daily basis. This is why we had a discussion with the Architects’ Association from the Chairman to the secretary who met with the Engineering Department and our architects to find out how to safeguard the cultural heritage. They want to focus on parks and improving services for the migrant citizens coming in on a daily basis because we have some major schools in the country. These include everything from public toilets, resting places, opening up more areas to have recreation facilities for families around the Beira, the Fort area and so on. We are also considering the buildings that have a heritage value and plan to restore and maintain them and give Colombo a new outlook. They were very enthusiastic and this is the groundwork that we would be doing during next three months. We would be able to see some tangible results hopefully.   Firstly it is about bringing in e-governance and instilling discipline in the Council. I’m also working on a mechanism to bring everyone to work Q  Many CMC workers are senior citizens who work day in and day out and receiving minimum wages. Are there plans to increase their salaries and incentives?   That was one of the first questions I asked the department heads when I assumed duties. I want to read those contracts because we outsource many of these work. In those outsourcing contracts there are minimum age and salary scales. I have given all these contracts to my legal team to study them. I have advised the department heads to thoroughly review those contracts and to inform these people to be present at work, to adhere to what is written in the contract or step down. In future when we sign contracts we need to be specific about certain things such as salaries, age etc. This is why I need a HR department established.    Q  In a previous interview you mentioned about establishing rehabilitation centres for the youth. Along with these centres, how would the drug menace be mitigated in future?   That is something that I have promised and would be doing within the next couple of months. I’m waiting for the Council to be formed in order to bring in resolutions to do many other things that are included in my manifesto. That’s a huge menace and it’s not an issue with just one strata of society, but it exists at every level. Much needs to be invested in terms of technical assistance and finances, but we would eventually make it a reality.    Q  During the previous Government most of the beautification projects were carried out under the purview of the Urban Development Authority (UDA). Why didn’t the CMC get involved?   Some of the projects such as housing and infrastructure development with sewer waste etc would be done with the line ministries and the Central Government. The funding will also have to come from the Central Government. But the CMC can handle basic beautification projects. For example the Independence Square belongs to the UDA and we need to consider people who just park their vehicles and leave. I have instructed them to have an authorized parking space. When you have restrictions people can walk to their destination. I’ll also have to work with the Health Ministry and several other ministries in certain projects.     "
"Mobitel takes the lead in helping combating Dengue among school children with the  ‘DengueFreeChild’ app","2018-03-28 10:34:37							0						 				1608","(From Left) Mr. Sunil Hettiarachchchi, Secretary – Ministry of Education, Mr. P. G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena, Chairman – Sri Lanka Telecom & Mobitel and Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Deputy Director General, Public Health Services officially launching the ‘DengueFreeChild’ app.Mobitel, Sri Lanka’s National Mobile Service Provider, launched an innovative mobile app to help combat the spread of Dengue among school children in Sri Lanka at a special event held at the BMICH on 27 March 2018.The ‘DengueFreeChild’ app was developed by Mobitel in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the University of Colombo and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The app enables users to proactively report of Dengue or suspected Dengue fever so that action can be taken to the premises around which the infection is prevalent for mosquito breeding areas as well as to alert other parents to keep a keen eye on Dengue-like symptoms in their own children.Around 30 percent of all Dengue patients who sought treatment in 2017 were children, according to the data collected by the National Dengue Control Unit of the Ministry of Health. “Early diagnosis of Dengue can save a child’s life,” says Dr. Hasitha Tissera, National Coordinator of the National Dengue Control Unit. “We have found that early diagnosis of Dengue and immediate treatment almost always leads to a complete recovery. The need for parents and carers to be alert and aware of the possibility of Dengue symptoms in their children cannot be overstated.”Recent statistics revealed that there are nearly 4.4 million students in more than 10,000 schools across Sri Lanka today. As the Dengue mosquito is reported to be active during the morning hours, students are all at greater risk of being infected if mosquito breeding grounds exist in schools and surrounding areas. The app creates awareness and allows sharing of information quickly that enables parents and school authorities to take preventive action to stop the spread of Dengue. Ministry of Education through Health and Nutrition Division is actively contributing to maintain schools free of dengue breeding sites. Therefore, this new app will help them to monitor the situation more closely.The ‘DengueFreeChild’ app has been created with separate user access for government officials and school authorities, in addition to the general public use of sharing and accessing information about Dengue patients.“Dengue has become a critical national health issue, and as the National Mobile Service Provider, we had a responsibility to find ways to combat this disease,” says Isuru Dissanayake - Senior General Manager Marketing, Mobitel. “We are proud to collaborate with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the University of Colombo and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore to design and develop this timely and much-needed application. It gives us immense satisfaction to leverage on our specialized mobile technology to enhance the wellbeing of the children of our country.” The ‘DengueFreeChild’ app is now available for free download by Android Users on Google Play Store. 						* Dailymirror.lk neither liable nor responsible for any information / contents published in this article"
"‘Flower  buds’  that didn’t bloom  !","2018-03-27 00:00:40							0						 				1068","These are tragic tales of the lives of some innocent parents who were compelled to grin and bear tragedies. These tragedies happened when their kids  breathed their last recently.   For many years, it has been reported that the dengue mosquitoes were active and were sucking the blood of the people from all walks of life. But it is ironic that such tragedies befall on innocent kids. The loss of such kids is felt by their parents forever. It is not only the dengue mosquito, but also the lives of the infants that have been snuffed out in various devilish forms from time to time.   Among those who died recently was a son by the name Shalika Shehan. This child is said to have lived with much hope. Having lived in Kalutara area, he was first educated at Kalutara Maha Vidyalaya and later enrolled at Royal College, Colombo. He showed a keen interest in education and extra-curricular activities. He had just sat for the Advanced Level Examination when this tragedy took place. When the son worshiped his father, who was about to leave home, he might not have thought that it was the last time he would get to worship his dad. Shehan, who died of a sudden heart attack, was also denied of the opportunity to know that he had obtained many distinctions at A/Level Examination. The house where he lived is isolated today.    Among those who died recently was a son by the name Shalika Shehan. This child is said to have lived with much hopeAnother death   Another ‘flower bud’ named Dewindi, who lived under the parents care, had a similar tragedy. She studied in grade 5 in Thri/Padavipura Jayanthi Wewa School. The cartoon ‘hero’ in a TV. Programme, that was shown on the TV, Influenced her to imitate this character and his actions. One such feat that repeated was binding a creeper around her neck. This resulted in the unfortunate death of tiny Dewindi. This is how she said goodbye to life at an unexpected moment.   Small children are like flowers. Their small hearts are warmed with the love and affection they show for fauna and flora. Susith Nirmal who lived in Inuwila in Chilaw also died unexpectedly. He was a resident of Samindugama (an area spanning 40 acres), in Chilaw. He had gone to the jungle with the hope of catching parrots with an unknown person. This person has had the habit of visiting the village to pluck king coconuts. But, he was unable to fulfill his expectations of catching parrots which was child’s hobby. It is said that this boy had been sexually abused, the incident leading to his death. It was after several days that the boy’s remains were found. The remains of the boy were found in a jungle in Inuwila.   Even before the flames of Susith’s funeral pyre died down the death of another child, this time a daughter, was recorded. The name of the deceased was Saheli Niwarthika. She was a grade four student and attended Buddhist Primary school in Dehiowita. She was very humble and obedient to her teachers. The children in her class had to walk on the coconut shells as part of an extra-curricular activity, prescribed in the syllabus. The children in this class were seen practicing this activity earnestly on the gravel-less ground. Therefore, it was a frequent sight for the teachers to see these kids practice.   All of a sudden, small Saheli had collapsed on the ground while trying this exercise. In spite of the fact that Saheli was hospitalized by the teachers concerned, she died unexpectedly.   The daughter, Madubhashini Buddhika Liyanage (16) was another student who faced an untimely tragedy as all others mentioned here. She studied in grade eleven in Udagama Maha Vidyalaya in Atabage in Gampola. She was a resident of Deniyagama area in Millagahamula in Gampola. She was well versed in music.   She played the violin well and was a gifted singer. She also attended dancing classes with her classmates. She had dropped her head saying that she was having a severe headache. Despite being taken to the nearby rural hospital for treatment, her condition had worsened. She was admitted to the Gampola Hospital for further treatment as per the medical instructions, but her life could not be saved.   However, it is clear that these deaths have left a clear message for us. ‘Malnutrition also causes untime deaths’According to Nutritionist, Harshani Meegaswatte, obesity has become an issue, especially among urban children. But, there are also children who suffer from malnutrition despite food being available at homes. Although some mothers give food to their children these diets aren’t balanced. Most children as a result don’t carry the proper weight for their age. The weight of some children are below average. Some children don’t have breakfast. Such children have their first meal during the interval.   She added that it was not only child abuse, but malnutrition that has brought untimely deaths to children. These factors are the causes for their malnutrition, she emphasized.  it was not only child abuse, but malnutrition that has brought untimely deaths to children "
"Lankan formulates mosquito repellent","2018-03-26 00:03:25							0						 				964","Says it addresses all factors that attract mosquitoesTo repel the mosquitoes that spread dengue, filaria and malaria, an engineer has formulated a liquid.“This liquid is pleasant to smell as well as it is safe on the human body.  It will smell for only five minutes but it can repel mosquitoes for 12 to 14 hours,”  Eng.  Rakitha Brito said. “The liquid will not affect children or pregnant women,” he claimed.“I have taken so much of time and energy to do the research and analysed the solution for the problem.  The main cause mosquitoes get attracted to human body is breathing -the release of carbon dioxide and the rate of releasing carbon dioxide is more in pregnant women.’’‘’When exercising there will be more chemical reaction in the human body and it will release lactic acid during the session, so that mosquitoes will be attracted to it according to research.Alcohol also attracts mosquitoes,” he said.  ‘’All over the world, people are still working on a solution to this.  Yet, the sprays aren’t effective and there are many side effects.  Normally we can prevent mosquitoes by preventing dark coloured clothes.We should use yellow lights at home. We also could use Lavender and Maduruthalaa to repel mosquitoes.’’“I wanted to repel mosquitoes instead of killing them. The liquid gives a smell, which is not tolerated  by mosquitoes and functions as a repellent. I hope many people would use this.I also hope it will spread around the world,’’  Brito said. "
"Vehicles of corruption From bicycles to  Benz cars","2018-03-22 00:00:04							0						 				2343","Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe didn’t mince his words when addressing newly elected members to the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). He told them what is expected of them and what is not.‘Save the city dwellers from dengue, resolve the garbage issue and keep the city clean,’ he said. Now if any CMC member or indeed anyone elected to any local government authority had to have responsibilities outlined thus, it is sad.However, Wickremesinghe was just warming up, it seems. He quickly moved to what could also be called known-stuff but stuff that few talk about. Stuff related to corruption.‘Don’t become politicians who search for luxuries after coming to the field as paupers,’ he is quoted as having said.Obviously there are those born with the proverbial silver spoon. They came into politics in a Benz car and still drive around in such vehicles. Well, some have expanded a single Benz into a fleet. Cars are seen, bank accounts are notHe uses an apt analogy: ‘Some politicians own only a push bicycle when they come to politics but later obtain Benz cars. Don’t think of becoming such politicians.’He’s correct. We have seen how politicians grow, literally and metaphorically. The tale has been told and retold by cartoonists across many decades. Cartoonists exaggerate for effect but in this case it’s fair depiction. Wickremesinghe has been spared and for good reason. He’s remained lean throughout his political life.Obviously there are those born with the proverbial silver spoon. They came into politics in a Benz car and still drive around in such vehicles. Well, some have expanded a single Benz into a fleet. Cars are seen, bank accounts are not.In any event, he has articulated a problem. He has not offered a solution, though.If telling people, ‘Aney, please don’t steal’ worked, we wouldn’t need a commission to investigate allegations of bribery and corruption. Indeed, we wouldn’t need courts. Judges and lawyers would be out of work. It just doesn’t work that way and Wickremesinghe probably knows this.Now, we shouldn’t make too much of a cautionary note made by a party leader to greenhorn politicians. We should, on the other hand, talk about the problem which, sadly, neither Wickremesinghe nor his partner-in-governance President Maithripala Sirisena has done little about. Corruption.When Maithripala Sirisena announced that he would contest the presidency, former president Chandrika Kumaratunga said ‘he is the only one in the current regime who is not corrupt.’We don’t know what Sirisena’s first vehicle was nor what he purchased last nor how. Perhaps Wickremesinghe would know. That’s another matter.What we saw immediately after he won the election is Sirisena and Wickremesinghe with the obvious approval of Kumaratunga appointing to cabinet those who in their book were corrupt. That was the beginning and that’s not to say that those in the United National Party were squeaky clean. They most certainly were not!We don’t have to list all the wrongdoings of politicians in the ruling coalition. The term ‘bond scam’ would do. There was scam and there was aiding and abetting. Wickremesinghe and Sirisena both know all about it. The first COPE report was scuttled by dissolving parliament.Arjuna Mahendran’s innocence was claimed, the man was defended. The Attorney-General helped by choosing who to attack; who not to. Those who were clearly under a cloud were bailed out with new positions.Clearly there are lots of loopholes and Wickremesinghe would know about most of them and also those who used these conveniences. Surely, it’s not only those in ‘other parties’ who moved did the bike-to-Benz number?There are no easy plug-all-holes solutions. The institutional arrangement needs to be fixed. The human resources are clearly inadequate, inept and corrupt. Political interference continues to be a problem despite the 19th Amendment. The Ministry of Law and Order is being treated like a hot potato by the Government, with three ministers being in charge of the subject over the last two months.Don’t become politicians who search for luxuries after coming to the field as paupersMore than all this, there’s what could be called a cardinal principle in the matter of sanctioning and encouraging wrongdoing. This is how it goes, as was pointed out editorially in a different newspaper about six years ago: if the boss is corrupt, he/she gives a licence for corruption to everyone under him/her.If any person down the line is corrupt, it means that either the boss is corrupt or inept. Lots of hats there and people are more than welcome to pick them up.If we have come to a point where newly appointed representatives need to be told ‘Please don’t rob’ we are in pretty bad shape. One of the key issues and one which is either ignored or is unknown to the relevant persons is that the primary task of the elected is to represent and the make laws. They are legislators and not executives.However, the moment the pernicious ‘Decentralized Budget’ was introduced (by a previous UNP government), each and every legislator got the opportunity to play executive in his/her electorate and in most cases without any consultation with other entities, political or administrative, authorized to handle development. When you execute at any point, you tend to forget the legislating function.When you have give people the license to cut corners and make bucks, it is silly to expect them to think of push bicycles and not Benz cars.If telling people, ‘Aney, please don’t steal’ worked, we wouldn’t need a commission to investigate allegations of bribery and corruptionTo put it simply, when you take the village out of the hands of the villagers and put it in the pocket of the politician, you are facilitating Benz-dreams. Wickremesinghe is not doing anything of the sort, but he’s doing nothing to put things right.Asset declaration at arrival and departure is a must. A strong audit commission that can resist political interference is a must. Honesty and integrity are musts. It’s sad that we must mention these things to bicycle-to-Benz politicians.Here’s an exercise for the UNP leadership: conduct a quick survey under two broad headings, ‘First vehicle’ and ‘Current vehicle’. What was it, how much did it cost, how did you find the money, why did you choose it as opposed to something else, are the questions that need to be asked. It’s something all party leaders can do, if they have the courage or the moral authority that is.Malinda Seneviratne is a freelance writer. malindasenevi@gmail.com. www.malindawords.blogspot.com"
"Association of former International Civil Servants (AFICS) holds AGM","2018-03-16 00:00:09							0						 				1837","The 24th Annual General Assembly of the Association of Former International Civil Servants (AFICS) Sri Lanka was held on February 17, 2018.   The following were unanimously elected as AFICS (Sri Lanka) Office Bearers for 2018:  President: Dr. Nimal Hettiaratchy (UNICEF, UNFPA, UNDP); Vice- Presidents: Mr. Lalith Godamunne (UNHCR) and Dr. Methsiri Gunaratne (WHO); Secretary-General: Mr. K M D Gunaratne (Commonwealth Secretariat); Treasurer: Mr. Tilak Dias Abeysinghe (UNHCR);   Social Secretary: Dr. Laksiri Mendis (UNDTCD); Editor: Mr. Vincent Kumarapelie (UNV) Head Office); Committee Members: Dr. Nihal Abeyesundere (WHO), Dr. Adrian Senadhira (WHO),   Mr. Ranjith Seneviratne (FAO), Dr. (Mrs.) Kamini Mendis(WHO), Ms. Grace Jayakody (IMO)   Mr. Vitus Fernando (IUCN, ADB, WMO), Dr. Nimal A Fernando (ADB), Dr. Tuley de Silva (UNIDO),Mr. Asela Dassanayake (UN-ICTY), Mrs. Jeeva Pillai Essex (UNDP, ADB, WB),   Mr. Hema Dassanayake (WHO), Mr. Ranjith Vithana (UNIDO), Mr. Michael George (WFP, FAO) and Mr. T S A De Silva (UNCTAD)   The Association of Former International Civil Servants (AFICS) Sri Lanka was launched in 1993, with the late Dr. Gamini Corea, former Secretary-General of UNCTAD, as the first President. The membership comprised a group of Sri Lankans - scientists, doctors, engineers, agriculturists, economists and administrators, who had served the United Nations family and other international organizations such as the Commonwealth Secretariat and Regional Banks.  The objectives of the Association were defined as promoting the purposes and activities of organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and other international organizations; fostering friendly relations and intellectual contacts among its members, establishing and maintaining a data-base of former international civil servants from Sri Lanka for the purpose, among others, of identifying and providing appropriate expertise to governmental, non-governmental and international agencies if and when requested. This latter activity is expected to contribute to the social and economic development of the country.   During the tsunami period AFICS rose to great heights. AFICS built a house in Hikkaduwa; carried out mental health projects in eight Grama Seva Niladhari Divisions in Hikkaduwa to reduce mental health concerns and psycho-social disorders among post-tsunami victims; assisted in carrying out a health survey of the community and a rapid assessment of drinking water practices among the target population. AFICS also initiated a scholarship fund to award scholarships to deserving students and assisted two schools in the Hikkaduwa area.   Ably assisted by the Lions Club of Havelock Town, AFICS conducted Medical camps at the Nagaswatte Community Centre in 2016 and 2017 where checking of blood pressure, testing of vision, and examining women for cervical and breast cancer took place and patients were referred to the National Hospital, Kalubowila Teaching Hospital and appropriate Municipal clinics.   AFICS responded to a popular request from the female members of Kirillapone Community for training facility in sewing, which they intended to use for self-employment. A four months’ course was inaugurated for eight members. AFICS submitted a proposal to find partial funding for this project to the Chairman of IDEAS, in addition to the support extended by the community to facilitate it by providing lunch and transport. Thus, this project was collaborated by Singer Company, AFICS and IDEAS. The project is being implemented successfully.   Two members who had served with WHO played a role in the WHO Declaration of Malaria and served on the Dengue Oversight Committee which advises the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka.   The Association also gives due consideration to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals for Sustainable Development, i.e. Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger, Achieve Universal Primary Education, Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women, Reduce Child Mortality, Improve Maternal Health, Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other Diseases, ensure environmental sustainability, Develop a global partnership for development.   "
"MAN’S INHUMANITY TO MAN","2018-03-15 03:54:00							2						 				9423"," HOSPITAL HOAX!!! There is no other country in the world where ‘MAN’S INHUMANITY TO MAN’ is more explicit, more brazenly displayed, than in this BUDDHIST COUNTRY of ours!!!  The first HOAX is the Government promising FREE MEDICINE, FREE HOSPITALIZATION to its citizens.  If that were true, this land would be a paradise indeed. You are admitted FREE, unlike in the schools but God helps you once you get in. It is not the doctors but the nurses and attendants you have to beware of!!!  Apparently, according to their regulations, a patient who is very ill is allowed to keep someone to look after them, but that person has to stay where they are told to stay, not near their patient. When they check on the patient from time to time, they find to their horror that the patient has either vomited or passed urine or, in some cases, is even unconscious without anyone’s knowledge. WHY? WHY, because the caregiver is not anywhere near the patient and does not know what has happened.  BUT WAIT! There is an alternative, for sure, if you pay Rs. 1,500/- a day you can get an attendant from the hospital, an attendant who is never around but appears mysteriously during visiting hours only, to see how much money they can scrounge and also to get a share of whatever fruits or other items that have been brought for the patient.  Most of the time, whatever has been brought is stolen and either sold or taken to their homes.!! A glaring example of man’s inhumanity to man! Can a poor patient who is admitted to a General Hospital out of sheer necessity because they can’t afford to get into any other hospital, can they possibly pay 1,500/- a day for a special attendant???  IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, WHO CHECKS ALL THIS INHUMAN BEHAVIOUR? ARE ANY OF THE AUTHORITIES AWARE OR ARE THEY PART AND PARCEL OF IT? Don’t these VULTURES REALIZE THAT SITUATIONS COULD BE REVERSED IN NO TIME, THAT THEY COULD WELL BE THE PATIENT WHO NEEDS CARE AND THEY WILL HAVE NO ONE TO GIVE IT TO THEM?  That is not the only injustice meted out - the other horror is when it comes to MEDICINE!!! Medicine is prescribed but most often the unsuspecting patients are told that the medicine is not available and they have to get it from outside.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE MEDICINE AT THE HOSPITAL IS SOLD AND THE POOR PATIENTS HAVE TO PAY AN ARM AND A LEG FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD GET FREE!!! WHO LOOKS INTO ALL THIS - WHO CARES ABOUT THE WORRIES AND AGONIES OF THE POOR PATIENTS??? DOES ANYONE CARE???   CANCER HOSPITAL If you think the above is bad, wait till you hear this.  IT IS TRULY HORRENDOUS!!!  Having cancer in itself is horrendous but these inhuman vultures carry on as though they or their people are never going to be struck by cancer or any other terrible disease. After a patient has been operated they are asked to come back to the clinic twice a month to check on their progress.  The Sri Lankan vultures have found a way of cashing in on this also. When you go to the Cancer Hospital clinic you have to wait your turn to see the doctor and the wait is endless, BUT if you place Rs, 200/- in the Record Keeper’s filthy hand, your file miraculously appears at the top of the endless pile of files.  Here again, I ask, what are the authorities doing about this treachery??? The problem of medicine remains the same here as well, irrespective of the fact that these poor patients have a life-threatening illness and desperately need the medicine prescribed.  More often than not they are told the medicine is not available. Amazingly though the medicine IS available at the pharmacy next to the Cancer Hospital!!!  FREE EDUCATION, FREE HEALTH CARE??? - FREE WIFI, OH YES; WE GOT THAT, THE ONLY ONE THAT IS REALLY FREE!!    CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL Surprisingly, the situation at the Children’s Hospital seems to be positive. However, the major drawback is the lack of space, especially when the country is faced with Dengue in ‘epidemic’ proportions!!!  Three or four children are compelled to share one bed, which is not only uncomfortable for the children but totally unhygienic as well!!! There is a desperate need for another Children’s Hospital.  Instead of concentrating on putting up more high rises, the Government has not addressed the necessity of building another Children’s Hospital. We wonder why issues of national importance are always put on the back burner!!!   FATHER GRANFATHER RAPE CHILD In today’s newspaper, we read that in Meetiyagoda, the father and grandfather no less, have BOTH raped a 7 –year-old girl!  This is the Buddhist country we live in, the country that condones such brutality, that allows these perverted swine to get away with such heinous acts of RAPE on THEIR INNOCENT CHILDREN!!!  WHY, WHY, WHY CAN’T WE BRING IN SOME REAL PUNISHMENT FOR THESE culprits INSTEAD OF JUST SENDING THEM TO JAIL??? WHY CAN’T WE DO WHAT THEY DO IN SAUDI ARABIA? DISMEMBER THEM! IF IT IS DONE ONCE, NOT ANOTHER COWARD WILL DARE TO RAPE ANOTHER CHILD!!  KEEP READING FOR MORE HORRIFIC EXPOSURES ON THE REALITIES OF BUDDHISM, PERPETRATED IN THIS COUNTRY BY THE SO-CALLED VENERABLE MONKS THEMSELVES!!!THE VOICE     "
"February tourist arrivals up 19% with China upsurge","2018-03-09 10:14:36							0						 				1432","China regains top source market position after 18 months lapse	Second consecutive month of double digit growth in arrivalsTourism arrivals to Sri Lanka in 2018 continued to grow in double digits for the second consecutive month in February, with China reclaiming the top spot as the largest tourist sourcing country after a lapse of 18 months, according to data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.Arrivals to the island reached 235,618 tourists, which was a 19.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase over February 2017. The partial closure of the airport in the first 4 months of 2017 had contributed to a lower base figure for tourist arrivals to grow from.Last month also saw the second consecutive month of double digit arrivals, signalling a return to Sri Lanka’s normal tourism growth rate this year, after 2017 turned out disappointing for the tourism industry, with most months recording low single digit, and at times negative arrivals growth, resulting in just 3.2 percent YoY growth for 2017.Western Europe remained the largest regional market for Sri Lanka’s tourism industry during the waning winter period with 82,310 arrivals which was a 7.2 percent growth YoY despite political uncertainty in the Eurozone. The British market expanded 17.8 percent YoY attracting 23,817 tourists. The number of Germans visiting Sri Lanka increased 16 percent YoY to 17,066 tourists, while 16,871 French visited the island, which was a 21.3 percent growth YoY.The second largest regional market was East Asia, with 50,192 arrivals, growing at a rate of 21.1 percent YoY during the month in which the Traditional Chinese New Year Falls, after recording negative growth last year.Chinese arrivals grew by 42.3 percent YoY to 35,929 tourists, while arrivals from Japan grew by 10.6 percent YoY to 5,263 tourists.Arrivals from South Asia meanwhile grew by 17.2 percent YoY to 41,177 tourists led by a 25.1 percent YoY increase in arrivals from India, from where 32,914 tourists were sourced. Arrivals from the Maldives, where political unrest continues, fell by 7.4 percent YoY to 4,726 tourists.Arrivals from Eastern Europe grew by 20.3 percent YoY to 28,601 tourists. Arrivals from Russia and Ukraine both grew slightly above average, bringing in 11,043 and 5,138 tourists respectively. Notably, the Polish market grew by 70.3 percent YoY to 3,195 tourists as well.The North American market grew by 27.5 percent YoY to 10,823 tourists, while the Australasian market too grew at an identical rate, bringing in 6,357 tourists. Arrivals from the Middle East however contracted by 29.6 percent YoY to 3,894 tourists.The first two months of this year saw the arrival of 474,542 tourists, which was a 13.8 percent growth YoY. With the continued absence of a tourism promotions campaign, the arrivals trend appears to have returned to the diminishing growth trend witnessed up to 2016, when setting aside 2017, where natural disasters, a dengue epidemic and the airport closure resulted in a flat year.  "
"Kandy violence leads tourists to cancel visits","2018-03-09 09:53:47							0						 				7179","Leading tour operators seeing some cancellation of visits	Tourism authorities highlight wide-ranging economic implications of short-sighted actions	SriLankan Airlines says closely monitoring situation  By Chandeepa WettasingheThe religious and communal violence that erupted in Kandy could end up stymying the momentum built up in the tourism industry over the past three months, as signs are emerging that foreign tourists are cancelling their visits to Sri Lanka.Over 80 tourists have cancelled their bookings made at one of the top three travel companies in Sri Lanka, which could possibly amount to a loss of 800 nights, Mirror Business learns.This is despite the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) constantly issuing updates on the situation, and working with tourism stakeholders and the police to ensure the safety of tourists in the Central district.Attempts to reach the top management of most of the leading travel companies and the two apex industry bodies—Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) and The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) were unsuccessful, as most were in attendance at ITB Berlin, the largest travel trade show in the world.Back home, SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayake hit back strongly against individuals and groups inciting religious and ethnic tension.“This is a wakeup call that shows the significance and the gravity of immature action on the part of those who contributed to this situation. The next time before someone throws a stone, or engages in any kind of road-rage, they should think ten times of the wide-ranging economic consequences of their actions,” he said.Ratnayake said that the tourism industry is projected to be the leading foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka in two years, and the society should understand the importance of preserving a peaceful environment to sustain the growth of the industry.“The loss of income affects not only the major hotels, but also the street seller, the tuk-tuk driver, the farmer and the restaurant worker,” he added.The tourism industry was just getting back into gear after 2017 turned out to be a disappointment with a partial airport closure and a dengue epidemic, which resulted in nearly flat growth.Relatively moderate growth last December was followed up by double-digit growth in January and February this year from key markets due to the winter season and the Chinese New Year, before the current tension in the major tourism hub of Kandy spurted.Sparks flew with a roadside brawl over a truck driver thwarting a three-wheeler from overtaking, which resulted in the latter assaulting the truck driver who passed away from the wounds sustained.The incident escalated into communal violence, with residents of the area fanning flames of religious hatred over the fact that the truck driver was Buddhist and the assailants were Muslim.Another death of a Muslim resulted in the ensuing chaos.Foreign media provided wide coverage on the developments, and the US, British, UAE and Australian governments issued travel advisories for their residents visiting Sri Lanka.However, the national carrier SriLankan Airlines, which flies most of the tourists to Sri Lanka, issued a statement, which said that it has yet to see a massive cancellation trend.“There could be some cancellations. We are closely monitoring the situation, but so far we are unaffected,” SriLankan said.A source within the airline yesterday said that it would take a day or two before the airline could state whether cancellations have substantially increased due to the situation.The unrest would not only result in cancellations by tourists who were set to visit Sri Lanka shortly, but would also discourage potential bookings for the coming months. Area returns to normalcy 	Tourists can resume their travel plans-SLTDAAccording to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), the volatile situation in the Kandy area is returning to normalcy, allowing tourists to resume their travel plans.“The situation in Kandy is improving and the area is fast returning to normalcy. No violent incident has been reported from the district in the last 18 hours.

"NBTS seeks blood brothers!","2018-03-08 01:53:16							0						 				2286","Donating blood is a meritorious deed that helps save many lives. The National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), attached to the Ministry of Health, is a decentralized unit which is the sole supplier of blood and blood products to state hospitals, including private institutions registered under the Ministry of Health. The NBTS recently announced that there is an impending risk of going through a blood shortage from the period of January to April this year.   According to NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa, approximately 400 to 450 thousand units of blood from voluntary blood donors are collected annually by the NBTS island wide. Any volunteer between the ages of 18 and 55 with a healthy body weight not less than 50 Kg can donate blood whereas in the case of a regular blood donor, the individual can donate blood up to the age of 60 years. Moreover, it is crucial to ensure that the donor is physically fit and is not under medication for any chronic illness or is not suffering from any disease or infection. It isn’t recommended for an individual to donate blood if he or she has traveled abroad within the past three months at the time of the blood donation. While a whole blood donor can donate blood every four months, it should be noted that platelet donors can donate blood after a two week interval.    Shortage of Blood Expressing his views to the Daily Mirror, Director of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) Dr. Rukshan Bellana said that during the period between January and April, a blood shortage is experienced every year. He said that the situation could worsen in the event an election is held during the given period.   “It is a usual phenomenon to experience a blood shortage between January and April annually. We experienced this shortage this year too. On top of that, we had the elections in February. During the election period, it is normal to witness a drop in the blood supply. This year, both these factors coincided,” Dr. Bellana stated.   “If we don’t do anything about it, we will walk into a crisis by next month or April. We have carried out a massive campaign during the past two or three weeks through our blood bank networks,” he added.   The NBTS has been instrumental in carrying out several effective blood donation campaigns throughout the country in a bid to raise awareness on the importance of donating blood while ensuring that the risk of an impending blood shortage would be countered via such an endeavour. Stating that the recent blood campaign that was held in Kaththankudi was a success, Dr. Bellana added that it was the first time in history that a blood donation campaign was held in Kaththankudi. The campaign attracted 600 donors and to date this has been the highest ever statistic associated with a blood donation campaign held in the Batticaloa District. The blood donation campaign at Kaththankudi was organized by a Senior Consultant of Classic Travels (Pvt) Ltd and social worker, Rizwan Hafiz in collaboration with the NBTS.   We have carried out a massive campaign during the past two or three weeks through our blood bank networks“Among the donors, the majority were represented by the Muslim community. Among them there were also ladies with burkhas who volunteered to donate blood. Their participation has helped dispel recent rumors, that it is considered bad to donate blood according to their religious practice. We held a similar campaign last Saturday (Feb. 17) in the Batticaloa town with nearly 160 donors. Though this campaign didn’t attract a big crowd, it was nevertheless a record set for the Batticaloa region when considering statistics of the past couple of years.   “So, we have stepped up the campaign activities and we are seeing some improvement. We are seeing how people are coming and extending support to this noble cause. Given the situation, I hope we might not run into a crisis, but we would have definitely experienced one if we had not acted in advance,” Dr. Bellana said.   A successful blood donation campaign is often a joint endeavor of several groupsUpon inquiring about how Colombo has coped with the situation pertaining to an impending blood shortage, he said that Colombo is always the highest in terms of available blood donors since it is congested with the highest population. However, noting that the same could not be applied in the case of Batticaloa, Dr. Bellana said that this was one of the main reasons why a blood donation campaign was organized in the said region. Highlighting that the situation in Hambantota is very unsatisfactory at present, Dr. Bellana informed that the NBTS is planning to organize its next blood donation campaign in this town in the near future.   “In the overall, we are doing well in certain regions and not so well in other regions. I don’t think Batticaloa will be a problem hereafter because we have had a good campaign here. Also, we have raised awareness among people and blood donation has been promoted among them.The blood donated by donors, free of charge, during the campaign is collected and stored. Then we issue this to the public and private sectors for medical reasons as per their needs,” he added.    Accidents and Traumas Explaining that accidents and traumas make up a high number of cases which demand blood, he added that surgeries which are growing in numbers, and are an everyday occurrence, have a greater demand for blood supply. Thalassaemia and cancer patients also require blood very often.“Not so long ago, we used to supply a lot of blood to treat dengue patients. Now since the treatment patterns have changed, not much blood is required to treat dengue patients although earlier we had a huge demand in this aspect. The number of major diseases, surgeries and accidents has increased at present, which is why we need more blood. It should also be noted when you take the Sri Lankan community, O+ is the type of blood that is mostly available within the community. O-, AB- and AB+ blood groups are very rare in the public,” Dr.Bellana said.    Organizing a Blood Donation Campaign To take part in this noble venture, it is important to know how to organize a blood donation campaign in one’s locality. Deemed to be a meritorious act, donating blood for those in need is indeed a good cause that would save many lives. Enlightening us on the procedure, NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa shared her views on the subject. She said that it would be ideal to arrange blood donation camps during the April festive season and that blood donors are most welcome to donate blood.   “A successful blood donation campaign is often a joint endeavor of several groups comprising Government and non-government organizations, private institutions, friends and volunteer groups. It should be noted that at least 50 donors should take part in a week day donor campaign whereas a weekend donor campaign is expected to attract at least 100 donors. On the other hand, a volunteer can donate blood at the premises of National Blood Centre Narahenpita anytime between 8.00 am and 6.00 pm. This centre is open all 365 days of the year. Donors can also donate blood at any of the hospital based blood banks between 8.00 am and 4.00 pm,” Dr. Saranajeewa said.   Among the donors, the majority were represented by the Muslim communityExplaining further on how to arrange a campaign, Dr. Saranajeewa said that the camp premise should be a familiar location to donors comprising sanitary facilities such as a washroom in addition to facilities such as parking space, clean and be a calm atmosphere. While laying emphasis that the NBTS doesn’t approve anyone except volunteers as donors, she further highlighted that organizers will be called for a meeting by respective blood bank networks prior to hosting the campaign to educate them on the procedures pertaining to organizing the event. The necessary equipment for blood transfusion would be provided by the NBTS.   “Mass blood mobiles with the participation of 1000 to 3000 donors are generally conducted by the National Blood Centre and Cluster Centre blood banks since they have the required capacity. Additionally, the NBTS wishes to invite the public to celebrate their life events by organizing a blood donation campaign at the blood bank premises. Also, those who are willing to donate blood can register themselves at the NBTS, which maintains a donor registry. This is very useful for the NBTS in the event of an emergency, in which case the NBTS can call and request a registered donor to donate blood” added Dr. Saranajeewa.     "

"When blood refuses to clot","2018-02-09 14:27:47							0						 				2995"," Blood is an essential life sustaining component in our bodies. Recall the last time you experienced a cut or injury to your body. It would most likely have been a small  wound. Remember how the blood initially discharged fast, then slowed down and stopped completely. All this happened during a short span of a few minutes. Our bodies have mechanisms to keep the blood from leaking out of the vessels. But there are certain conditions where this mechanism fails and even a small wound could be fatal. These conditions are called bleeding disorders. Today in Health Capsule, we present an interview done with Dr.K.A.C Wickramaratne, Consultant Haematologist and Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine, Karapitiya, during which he spoke at length when answering questions about bleeding disorders.  Q What is Haemostasis?   In order to carry out its functions optimally, blood should be maintained as a fluid inside the vessel and should clot immediately if the vessel is damaged. If blood form solid ‘clots’ inside blood vessels, it may lead to death of the patient. In such instances death will come in the form of a heart attack or a brain attack. On the other hand, when a blood vessel is damaged bleeding has to stop immediately which happens as a result of the forming of a blood clot at the site of injury. If this doesn’t happen the person would bleed out. There should be a delicate balance between the two because a slight tip of balance either way could be fatal. This process is called haemostasis.   Q How does a wound stop bleeding following an injury?   Clotting of blood after a vessel is damaged is a complex process with the participation of multiple factors. To make a long story short, von Willebrand factor (vWF), a special protein in blood, binds to a protein called collagen in the damaged site. This makes way for platelets, the small disc like particles in the blood to come and bind at the site, which then attracts more platelets to the site. So, a blood clot is formed, blocking the leaking of blood.   To make the platelet plug solid and retainable, a crisscrossing meshwork of fibrin is formed as a result of a cascade activating a series of proteins in plasma, called coagulation proteins. This process, called coagulation, stops the bleeding completely, anchoring the platelet clump. The final process looks after the healing of the wound, which includes the gradual breakage of the anchoring meshwork that is replaced by vessel wall tissues.   Q What happens during a bleeding disorder?   A bleeding disorder is any problem in the factors or components required for the complete clot formation. That includes platelets, von Willebrand factor, collagen and all the coagulation factors.    These can have two problems; reduced concentration below the required levels and the defective function of the factor.   These diseases are commonly acquired due to diseases in the body. E.g.: platelets are reduced when dengue fever is present. Coagulation proteins reduce to levels below normal. This condition occurs during liver disease such as cirrhosis. When these components are not adequate or not working appropriately, people experience bleeding disorders. Some of these conditions are acquired in later life or may be coming from generations down as l (inherited) diseases. Low platelets can also be seen with blood cancers or related diseases. The platelet function can also be inhibited by drugs taken for heart attacks such as apirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole etc.   Q How do these patients present?   The patients present with excessive and unusual bleeding, including heavy bleeding from a minor injury or during some instances spontaneous. They may complain of bleeding on the skin with no trauma or unusual blood stains in saliva, blood in urine, nose bleeds etc. Women can have heavy periods; a condition called menorrhagia.   When platelets or vWF is present in blood  in very low amounts or if these are defective, bleeding occurs mainly into the skin and mucosa. Dot like bleeding patches, bleeding from gums, nasal bleeding, big patches of bleeding spots and profuse bleeding following trauma are common in these patients.   When coagulation factors are defective or less, bleeding usually occurs some time after. This type of bleeding is seen as bleeding into joints (haemarthrosis) or big bleeds into muscles (haematoma).   A typical story in many patients with this condition is heavy bleeding following a tooth extraction. If the bleeding is immediate it is most likely due to a problem in platelets or vWF. If there was no bleeding issue after extraction and if the patient starts bleeding some times later, this is usually a problem in coagulation factors.    Q What are the common bleeding disorders seen today?   Von Willebrand DiseaseThis is the commonest out of all the bleeding disorders, with one in hundred individuals having the disease. It is inherited and may go unnoticed as ‘something normal’ in the family; specially among females. For instance the women in these families tend to have heavier menstrual periods than normal.   Haemophilia This is a very rare disease, with only around 2000 patients being present in all of Sri Lanka. Haemophilia occurs due to a deficiency of some coagulation factors. Commonly it is the deficiency of factor VIII or IX (different factors are named with roman letters). This disease is transmitted from genes; ex: mother to son. Females generally do not have main disease. Therefore, maternal uncles with bleeding problem could be indicative of haemophilia. These patients can present at toddler age, with bleeding into joints when trying to stand.   Q  How do you treat patients with bleeding disorders?   Patient education on various bleeding patterns is vital during treatment.   Coagulation defects such as haemophilia can be treated by giving periodic injections. Nowadays patients are trained to receive injections at home. In main hospitals haematologists have established haemophilia day centres to provide better care for such patients. These patients should be advised to avoid contact sports and to keep away from risky behaviours.   Platelet problems demand proper identification of the underlying disease. Steroids may be prescribed during some immune diseases.   They should not take Aspririn or related drugs without proper consultation of a doctor due to the risk of bleeding. They should always alert the doctor about their condition whenever they seek medical care.   "
"Sri Lanka sees strong growth in tourist arrivals in January","2018-02-08 00:02:43							0						 				2376","The Sri Lankan tourism industry got off to a strong start in 2018, with 246,972 tourists arriving in the country in January, recording a 12.6 percent growth over the corresponding period in 2017.The growth, which picked up in December 2017, continued in January, reversing slow and at times the negative growth experienced in the seven preceding months, over issues related to dengue, weather and the government’s lack of a tourism marketing campaign.In January, Western Europe was the leading source of tourists for Sri Lanka, with 83,324 visitors, which was a 14.9 percent increase year-on-year (YoY). The main individual source markets in Western Europe: the UK, Germany and France too grew by similar double-digit figures, attracting 22,410, 14,985 and 12,209 tourists, respectively to the island.Arrivals from South Asia increased 32.2 percent YoY to 54,815 tourists, boosted by arrivals from India increasing 40 percent YoY to 43,643 tourists. The Maldivian arrivals increased 9.4 percent YoY to 6,194 tourists despite the political turmoil in the archipelago nation.China, which was the largest tourism market for Sri Lanka last January, plunged by 22 percent year-on-year to 24,819 visitors this January, dragging the East Asian regional market down 15 percent YoY to 41,462 tourists.

"Vote for the party you think will protect your rights as a citizen : Eran Wickramaratne","2018-02-06 14:41:22							2						 				2091","The local government election has been marked as an important day in the political calendar. With many promises and plans, candidates both senior and amateur have started working for the people. Finance State Minister EranWickramaratne is positive about the changes that have taken place after the present government was elected to office. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Eran shared his thoughts about the challenges faced by the economy during the previous years while encouraging the people to use their vote wisely at the upcoming election.Excerpts :    Q: Colombo is a UNP stronghold. How confident are you that the UNP will win this time?A: When talking about an election, we need to look at the team as well as their manifesto. Since there’s a new law for the local government election there are suitable candidates nominated in other districts as well. Especially there’s a 25% presentation for women as well. The UNP has put forward a formidable team in Colombo led by Rosy Senanayake. Sri Lanka will have its first elected female mayor. Rosy is an experienced politician and she even served as the Ambassador for Malaysia. The work she has done in Sri Lanka and overseas has been commended by many people. She has a formidable team of professionals supporting her for the upcoming election. Teamwork is an absolute must in delivering results. The manifesto presented by Rosy Senanayake has highlighted on many services. A year and a half ago, this government decidedto have an ambulance service and many people criticized it from time to time. We rolled out this service in the districts of Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Colombo,Gampaha and Kalutara. One year after, the results were amazing. In less than 13 minutes, when you call 1990, an ambulance turns up at your doorstep or wherever the accident has taken place. This is how technology has been used to make services more efficient. Rosy Senanayake will make use of technology to make services more efficient within the municipality by introducing a service centre. In addition to that the city has many problems. Urban renewal programmes are needed. When you put up buildings you need to make sure that they adhere to the law and therefore the zoning has to be done properly. In addition to that there are other services that the citizens require. You need a clean environment, you need your garbage to be collected on time, you need your drains to be cleared and you need to fight the dengue menace. She has plans for these. In addition to that she is also planning to bring in vocational training facilities for the residents of Colombo in order upscale the income in lower income areas. Therefore the UNP has the people and the plan and therefore I urge you to vote for the UNP. If there are five votes at your home, it would be imperative that you use all five votes because this election is not only about electing your local member; it’s also about getting a majority. Even though there are no preferential votes, this is a proportional representation election, therefore every vote counts. Q :One of the major accusations from the Opposition is that the present government couldn’t bring in Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) as promised in 2015. But in 2016 a larger number of FDIs were brought in. What are your comments?A : When we took over reins of government in January 2015 this country was facing a crisis. There is a huge debt burden and this has increased over the last period. Our debt has increased and our foreign currency debt has increased. In addition to that we have replaced concessional debt with commercial debt so the entire debt profile has increased. The former government maintained an artificial Rupee-Dollar rate and when you maintain such a Rupee-Dollar rate you always understate your debt. When you free your currency to the market rate exchange rate naturally the real debt is reflected in rupees. So the increase in debt during this period has more to do with the currency being a free market currency than our government borrowing. This is the economy we inherited. The first two and a half years has gone to stabilize the economy. By freeing the exchange rate we have also been able to give exporters a wonderful opportunity to compete with the real world. In the past period under the SLFP-led government exports which were more than 30% of GDP had come down gradually to 14% of GDP. Exports are needed if we want to keep our living standards rising. So we have freed the exchange rate and therefore exports are rising too. Exports have increased in the past year by nearly 10% and this is a wonderful sign. GSP Plus has been achieved after our new government took office. Its benefits will be seen over the 2018-2019 period. Also there was a ban from the European Union on fishing exports from Sri Lanka which too has been lifted. This year alone fishing exports have increased by 39%. Confidence has returned. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is able to target inflation the old nexus between the government and the CBSL during the previous period has been broken. FDIs from USD 750 million during the last year has more than doubled to USD 1.8 billion in 2017. I think 2017 has been the watershed year and we are going to see the benefits in managing the economy prudently in 2018 and 2019. More investments, more jobs, more exports and rising living standards will be seen.Q: As a senior politician, what is your message to all UNP supporters in view of the upcoming election?A: On February 10, we have an opportunity to vote in our local governments across the country. Voting is an important right that the citizens have. We need to use that vote to protect democracy. On January 8, 2015 the citizens of this country voted for a change. That was a big change. We know that just a week ago, the President of this country went to the Supreme Court and asked a question; “Do I have five years or six years to govern?” The SC unanimously gave a verdict on that question and said that he has only five years. It’s very much different to the past. In the past if a question like that was asked in the SC they may have hesitated. But now the court is independent. The decisions are made based on the principles of law. The reason why I say this is because it wasn’t long ago when the Chief Justice of this country was kicked out of her office by the executive using the Parliament as an instrument. That is one of the darkest moments in our history. We have reinstated the independence of the judiciary and through the 19A we have strengthened the rights and position of the citizens. We brought in a new act giving citizens a Right to Information. You can use this right. As you elect your members you can go and find out how money was spent, what were it spent on and the quality of the investments and expenditures that they were doing. Citizens in Europe had this right over 200 years ago and citizens in South Asia had it more recently. But our citizens didn’t have this right until our government was voted in. Remember that in this election, when you discharge your civic responsibility you are voting to protect democracy. There may be shortcomings in our government but it has stood strongly for democracy and justice. The process may be slow and you may be disappointed sometimes that the outcomes haven’t come in the way you expected. But I can tell this for sure; we are on the right track and we are at the beginning of this journey and once we continue down this road, we will be the beneficiaries of a better society. So on February 10, vote for the party you think will protect your rights as a citizen."
"‘We’re a strong party supporting the Tamil population’","2018-02-06 00:57:56							0						 				5120","UPA’s Karuppiah Ramakrishnan representing the Kirula Ward wants montessoris that teach children in Tamil      The Local Government Elections are four days away and all candidates are gearing up for the big event. Contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) from the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Karuppiah Ramakrishnan representing the Kirula Ward has a vision to work towards transparency in politics. Having completed his degree in media at the University of Sri Jayawardanapura, Ramakrishnan has over 10 years of work experience as a sports journalist and has contributed to a leading English newspaper in the country. Speaking to the Daily mirror  , Ramakrishnan shared his plans for Colombo and its people.   QWhy did you want to enter politics? For me politics is a volunteer service. I have been involved in Rotaract and other youth activities and have always worked for the community. People join politics to earn more bucks and this is where they go wrong. Our party led by Mano Ganesan has produced two cabinet ministers and one state minister. At the provincial council level we have 16 members. We’re a strong party supporting the Tamil population and as a youngster I wanted to be involved in it to make a change.   QHow challenging is the new electoral system for newcomers? It is very easy to work under the new system. Each representative has to look after his or her particular ward. If the people vote for the correct person he or she will make sure that the people are very well represented. Now they don’t have to go collecting a higher number of votes from each city to win an entire electorate. Nobody can have his or her own way with this system and that is another positive. We can all work independently for the benefit of the people.   QThere are many Tamil people in Colombo. As a minority what major issues do they face? Issues in Colombo are common to all its people. Although we talk about just four lakhs of people in Colombo we need to consider upgrading the infrastructure facilities to benefit people visiting Colombo on a daily basis. The CMC should set an example to the rest of the municipal councils, but there has been very little progress over the past years. Dengue is another issue we need to concentrate on. I don’t remember the CMC being represented by a Tamil mayor during the past few decades. I remember that just after we received independence, a Tamil mayor was elected to office for a brief 10 months. Why has it happened that way? Therefore there’s a nationalist issue here. The CMC has 16 Montessori facilities that accommodate children of low income families. But they are conducted in Sinhala medium and it’s a challenge for Tamil children. Therefore such issues need to be looked at using a more holistic approach which will benefit everyone.    Now they don’t have to go collecting a higher number of votes from each city to win an entire electorate. Nobody can have his or her own way with this system and that is another positive. We can all work independently for the benefit of the people.    QWhat are your plans for Colombo? Dengue is one of the major issues. The only solution for dengue is fumigation which is bad for the environment. It not only kills the mosquitoes, but it disrupts the food cycle as well. Therefore it’s not a practical solution. We need to encourage people to stay clean and make sure that their gardens are properly maintained. That way this issue could be solved. Other countries don’t carry out fumigation to control the mosquito issue. If not for the British, the CMC wouldn’t even have had a building today. The UNP was in power for 60 years and what have they done?   Another issue is that the CMC introduced an e-Tax Online Payment system. But this system could be extended to other services as well. Therefore technology could be effectively used to make it more efficient.   Traffic needs to be controlled immediately. If the CMC puts in more thought to control traffic they could use a GPS system to indicate those entering Colombo where there is more traffic. It could be like a digital guide to Colombo showing people where they could find a washroom facility, a café and other places they would wish to visit. When we walk along Rajakeeya Mawatha, the environment is different to that in Maligawatte. Why couldn’t we plant more trees in Colombo? People in underserved developments live with minimum facilities. Some even don’t have space to pull up a clothing line and instead use a current wire to hang their wet clothes. This is the sad side of Colombo which we as a party will focus on.   QPeople have the tendency to abstain from voting as they claim that the system is corrupt. What is your message to them? If you exercise your voting rights during this election, you can elect someone who will work for your ward. Therefore people need to vote wisely. When these candidates go canvassing people can always ask for their educational qualifications and professional background, that way people can be sure about their vote. This is not the old system and therefore they do not have to worry. People have the power this time.   "
"‘We’ll be able to make a change this time’","2018-02-06 00:01:14							0						 				2030","SLPP’s Roshnie De Saram contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward believes that individuals with a professional background should be involved in politicsThe Local Government polls are a few days away and contestants are in the process of winning the hearts of people. Contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward is Roshnie De Saram under the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket. Roshnie is a proud pupil of Visakha Vidyalaya and sports a qualification in Business and Management from Australia. Belonging to a post-independence lineage of politicians, Roshnie has always been interested to serve the less fortunate.  If elected, Roshnie has big plans for Colombo and she shared her views about the upcoming polls during an interview with the Daily mirror . QWhy did you decide to contest this time?   We need to bring the country back to its former state and it is Mahinda Rajapakse who can do that. I initially supported the UNP, but I want to see change happen and therefore I decided to contest for the first time at the upcoming Local Government Elections.   QThose with professional backgrounds are seldom found in parliament. What are your views on this?   I think it’s very important that individuals with a professional background are involved in politics. Otherwise this country cannot function with people who have a lower level of education.  QColombo has many issues which were promised to be solved. The low-income households are one aspect. Is it right for politicians to make more promises to these people and in turn do nothing?   They are living under very poor conditions. Their bathrooms and other sanitary facilities need to be upgraded immediately. I think we should give them a hand to uplift their lifestyles.   QWhat are your plans for Colombo?   If I’m elected to office I will make some big changes for the benefit of my people. Some of my plans include building houses for those with special needs, eradicating dengue through efficient smoke treatment, implementing a central hotline system for prompt action to be taken; appoint committees consisting of residents, businessmen, environmentalists and professionals to be the voice of each ward. I’m also planning to have a city with an uninterrupted renewable energy system and an efficient health division for regulating food outlets and health services.   QWomen were virtually neglected in the political scene for a long time. What changes do you like to see happening with the introduction of the 25% quota for women?    I think it is one of the best decisions that was ever taken. Women do a lot of multi-tasking and we understand the requirements of every mother and sister. We need more women to be involved in the decision-making process. Mothers run the homes and their livelihoods need to be improved.   QHow important is it to implement infrastructure facilities to make the city user-friendly for differently abled people?   It definitely is a major requirement. When I visited the Wadiya I saw a boy who was begging. He was bent so badly and had no mother or father to look after him. They too need to live with dignity. It is important that they are given a proper place to stay in. They could be involved in self-employed businesses such as the incense industry. Their skills and talents such as artwork and handwork could be highlighted as well. So we need to start community centres as means of empowering them.  QPeople expected a change on January 8. Three years down the line what has the present Government achieved?   Nothing is happening today. Businesses could be improved, charity could be done, but we don’t see anything happening today. We have done our part to help the people, but they aren’t even bothered. I have helped people in my capacity, but today’s cost of living is so high. What we did for Rs. 75,000 back in the day exceeds the Rs. 100,000 limit today. Therefore it’s time to make a wise decision.   QColombo is known to be a UNP stronghold. How will you take up this challenge by contesting from the Pohottuwa?   People say that they are born UNPers. There are educated people making similar statements, but what have they got? I think they are only thinking about themselves and not of the rest of the citizens. Why can’t we change their mindsets? The former President loved the country and had a vision for it. I hope that we will be able to make a change this time.   Q What is your message to the people?   Don’t be selfish. I want to ask people to wake up and vote for what is right. Everyone is dreaming as they are being given big promises. We need to transform Colombo into a sustainable city. In order to do that, people need to be wise in taking their decisions.       "
"We need professionals to take this country forward - Chandradasa Jayasinghe","2018-02-05 00:02:45							2						 				1739","The upcoming polls have opened doors for a diverse group of individuals including professionals, youngsters and more females to contest. Representing the United National Freedom Front (UNFF) - a newly formed political party under the leadership of former Provincial Council member Maithree Gunaratne is Chandradasa Jayasinghe competing for the Sri Jayawardanapura Municipal Council from the Nawala-East Ward. Having served as a civil engineer at the State Development and Construction Corporation and an engineer at the Road Development Authority, Jayasinghe believes that more professionals need to be involved in the political system. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Jayasinghe shared his plans for Nawala.   Excerpts :    ""I believe that the present crisis situation in the country in general and in the local government in particular is due to the non-participation of professionals in governance as policymakers. Therefore I wanted to step in to make a change in the system"" Why did you want to contest for an election?  I have been indirectly involved in the political scene because some of my family members were UNPers. It was an uncle of mine who formed the Podujana Party in which I was a member. But I wasn’t involved in party politics. However I have been following the political history and as professionals we needed a party to represent the people. Then in April 2005 a few of us got together and formed the Podujana Professional Group with about nine members. Then during the previous general elections we thought of going in as an independent group and the United National Freedom Front (UNFF) was formed as the 70th political party of the country. I believe that the present crisis situation in the country in general and in the local government in particular is due to the non-participation of professionals in governance as policymakers. Therefore I wanted to step in to make a change in the system.    ""This is the fault of party leaders. They should know to get professionals involved in order to provide solutions for various matters at hand. When Lee Kwan Yew visited Sri Lanka, he wanted to make Singapore another Sri Lanka. But what has happened to Sri Lanka today?""What are your plans for Nawala?  If I am elected, I will be mainly focusing on five issues. These include the dengue problem which has caused many issues in the area. The other issue is the garbage problem which will be effectively controlled to make Nawala a beautiful city. Workplace corruption is another issue that we as a party are focusing on. As another avenue we are also looking at stopping all bribing activities which happens in local authorities and make them efficient offices where people can go and get their work done as quickly as possible. Provincial development is another main area of focus.    Many voters are disgusted by this systemFlyover causes traffic jamIn China engineers involved in politicsThe Rajagiriya flyover was one of the main projects which took place under the good governance regime. Has it been an effective solution for the traffic congestion in the area?  No, not at all. Nawala was a traffic-free city but with the flyover, traffic movement has increased. Now nobody can cross the road as well. Flyovers are not an effective solution to curb traffic.   How challenging is it to contest as a new comer of a new political party?  There are 1221 houses in this ward and I have managed to visit almost all the houses. Many voters are disgusted by this system and some are wondering whether to vote or not. I have spent time talking to them and encouraging them to use their franchise wisely. Voting is a form of participation in order to make a democratic country. I have a good relationship with other candidates as well. The people spoke to me about their problems and I have done what I can in my capacity.    "" I believe that the present crisis situation in the country in general and in the local government in particular is due to the non-participation of professionals in governance as policymakers""We don’t see many professionals in the present political system. What are your views on this?  This is the fault of party leaders. They should know to get professionals involved in order to provide solutions for various matters at hand. When Lee Kwan Yew visited Sri Lanka, he wanted to make Singapore another Sri Lanka. But what has happened to Sri Lanka today? In China there are many engineers involved in politics. This is how they have developed their country. We can’t ask a butcher to do a surgery on human and likewise, we need professionals to take this country forward.    “I am confident that at least five or six members would definitely be elected. Our party leader is an unblemished character and we want to keep our identity as professionals”What are your views about the mixed electoral system?  There is very less expenditure this time. It is only a marketing campaign which requires little money but that too doesn’t have to be exorbitant amounts. We have to concentrate on our ward and we don’t have to keep meetings because door-to-door campaigns are more effective in my opinion.   How confident are you that you would win?  I am confident that at least five or six members would definitely be elected. Our party leader is an unblemished character and we want to keep our identity as professionals. Pic by Kushan Pathiraja  "
"The municipality cannot function without the central government : Rosy Senanayake","2018-02-01 11:05:13							8						 				7973","UNP Mayoral candidate Rosy Senanayake is gearing up for the upcoming poll. Making a change in the political landscape, if elected to office, Rosy will be the first female mayor of Colombo. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Rosy spoke about a few serious concerns at hand and her future plans for the city.Q: There were various projects in your manifesto. Are such similar projects done in other countries as well?A: Yes, garbage is a classic example because in every other country garbage is a treasure. Garbage can be converted to energy and it has various other uses as well. So we are looking at finding a permanent solution for the garbage dump. In all honesty and fairness we need to understand that the previous government didn’t have a solution for this garbage issue. I have been complaining about the health hazard but they didn’t consider the repercussions of dumping it in Meethotamulla. They didn’t know what to do with the garbage because it can be categorized in to various types such as perishable, non-perishable, clinical etc. Every type of garbage could be used for various purposes and it is a money spinner as well. We are now looking at waste-to-energy projects. The Prime Minister has now found a permanent dumping place in Puttalam. We can also have a few incinerators within the city and dispose the garbage.Q: A similar issue like the garbage problem is the condominium bubble that’s coming up. Do you have plans to bring in regulations for these constructions?A: Definitely there has to be regulations because I don’t think the city can hold so many constructions. There are many illegal constructions coming up which will be a hazard. Even these waste water lines are very archaic. The population too has increased but we don’t have the capacity yet to serve the people in those areas. We are giving out a 10-year plan where we will be improving the infrastructure with regard to sewage lines, wastage lines etc which will be done in stages. Housing is one of the prime areas that I will be looking at. Proper sanitation and toilet facilities are areas which we will thoroughly concentrate on. For the past 25 years we couldn’t do much in the city simply because the central government was not from the party. Colombo has been a UNP stronghold and it is our heart but we have received step-motherly treatment.Q: Projects such as the Independence Arcade and the Floating Market incurred losses. How will you make them profitable ventures?A: There are ways and means in making a project profitable. There are many aspects we need to focus on, one being that of women. There are women who work as domestic aides since they need to earn a living. But we need to look at empowering them and allow them to stand on their own feet. Finance is a big issue because even for a woman to start her own catering business, she needs money to make it happen. It is important that we strengthen the livelihoods of women especially in the Colombo city limits. In my manifesto I have promised to have 25 community centers in areas where the municipality’s services are needed. We can start a Grameen banking system where women can get collaterals and other benefits when they face certain difficulties in life. We also need to focus on children because what happens today is that they just go to school and even if they fail or not they end up riding a three-wheeler. . But they need to be trained to take on basic challenges in life. There will be three vocational training centers for the youth thereby addressing the unemployment issue as well.Q: Poor conditions of the road network is a complain all citizens have. How will you upgrade them?A: That is another key area that we are focusing on. The municipality cannot function without the central government. They cannot carry out some of their projects without the municipality. So it’s a two-way system. There will be a flyover project, underground transport and canal transport as well. We are planning some mega projects with the Megapolis Ministry. We will take the services to the people. So the people have to come to the Colombo municipality and get their work done. But this time the service will be made more efficient so that they don’t have to pay repeated visits to get one job done. They complain that they have to bribe somebody to get things done. Bribery and corruption will totally be eradicated. Dengue is one of the biggest hazards that we have faced. If the city is clean and the water is flowing; if we have smart sewage lines and other technology we will be able to eradicate the dengue mosquito. On the other hand participatory citizens are a must and I will be having townhall meetings to listen to the likes, grievances and suggestions of people.Q: How confident are you that you will win?A: I’m very confident about my win. Colombo municipality is untouchable we have never lost. I want to win so that I don’t have to draw an alliance with somebody else. I have a team of professionals who can help us to deliver at the end of the day. I also want to encourage the general public to be a part of the system."
"GOvt. has shown they aren’t  capable of delivering -Sharmila Gonawela","2018-02-01 00:06:44							1						 				5979"," The battle for Local Government Elections is heating up. An election should benefit the people, irrespective of symbols like the Pohottuwas, Beetle leaves or Elephants through which they come into power. Several decades down the line, people are still hoping for a better country. Sharmila Gonawela is contesting from the Bambalapitiya Ward for the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) under the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket. Speaking to the Dailymirror, Gonawela spoke about the challenges she faced being a Municipal Councillor back in 2002 and what she is planning to do if elected.   Excerpts :   QYou were a member of the CMC before. What made you contest again?  I was a member back in 2002 and I won under the UNP ticket. I was the only woman sitting with 52 other men. I have fought corruption and malpractices, but I never got the support that I needed from the party. Thereafter I went to the Bribery Commission, the CID and other Presidential Commissions with documentation to complain about all these issues. Eventually I stepped down from politics after four years. But in 2010 after the war concluded I voted for Mahinda because I thought it was the duty of all Sri Lankans. He invited me this time and I therefore decided to contest under the SLPP ticket.    If I can be the Mayor of Colombo who has worked for the city after 60 years, who has built up a greener, healthier and an IT-friendly city and if people say that all this was done by a woman, I would be the happiest. I’m also sure that I can be that person as well QBack in 2002, women were rarely involved in the political scene when compared to the present time. What challenges did you face back then?  There were some men who were very supportive. But when I went in I was the only woman sitting there. Some would bring in bottles and get drunk at official meetings and then I requested for a private area. I even refused to use the toilets there because they were in a row with just one door. Although I requested for a separate room, neither the party nor the councilors backed me. They feared that I would get more power if I went in to a separate room. So my requests were more often than not, turned down.    QWhat are your views on operationalizing the 25% quota for women in politics?  It’s an excellent move. Women have to be encouraged to be in politics. They are more sensitive towards issues and we also want to change the political culture. We need to be more transparent and ensure a corruption-free society. We have 5% of Parliamentarians who are women, but what have they really spoken about? There was an issue of a 14-year-old girl who was raped in Down South and she then took her life. We also have the incident where the Uva Province Chief Minister made a teacher kneel down. But has any female Parliamentarian made any statement with regard to these issues? When my opponent candidate Rosy was in the Women’s and Children’s Affairs ministry, there was a complaint made regarding the rape of an underaged girl by a powerful cabinet minister’s son. But was any action taken? With regard to the Bond Issue, Rosy was in the COPE committee and during the 100 days inquiry a vote was called for and she didn’t come and vote. The son was accused of it. But she went and sat with Sujeewa Senasinghe when he launched the book. So aiding and abetting is equal to being corrupt.   QHow challenging is the political game today with the implementation of the Mixed Electoral System?  I’m on the National List and looking after the Bambalapitiya Ward. Just because women’s representation was increased, if the number of councillors is being increased from 53 to 113, we are still placing the burden on the people. As at now, we don’t see any service being rendered to the people. We are adding to the 53 who are already available, so it’s the rate payer who will be deprived of their services which they should be getting. I feel it’s not very practical. With the increase the general council meetings have been shifted elsewhere and Rs. 25 lakhs is being charged per sitting. In addition to that the existing members’ room is being renovated to accommodate 113 members, but what if this system is a failure? What will they do with 113 seats?   I must say that I have received good feedback, especially from Muslim ladies. People in Colombo have come to realise that they get nothing out of the rates they have been paying for 60 long years. The Government has shown that they aren’t capable of delivering anything. I feel that there’s a big swing QWhat are your plans for Colombo?  In 2003 I spoke of a greener Colombo. I also spoke of a separate bus line for women in the city. We need to implement these things. Also with regard to the traffic congestion in Colombo we can only talk of sky trains and a good city bus service run by the private sector. The transport system comes under the Central Government and the city bus service is the only thing we can depend on. Garbage is another issue. Way back we had the ‘Kunu mola watte’ in Kirulapona and Central Colombo. Garbage was brought here and burnt. Today this ‘Kunu mola watte’ is called Nagaswatte and has been turned into a low-income housing area. People made a living at ‘Kunu mola watte’ by segregating plastic, cardboard and other materials which were eventually sold. The segregation was done free-of-charge because people had an interest in collecting them. This has come to a halt as well.   It was the UNP that led the CMC for 60 years. During those 60 years they had no plan. Of course Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had a good plan for garbage, but as they came in, it was stopped due to political reasons. But I believe that we have to stop thinking politically and look at result-oriented approaches for the people. If they continued what Gota started, people would have said this is Gota’s project, but this garbage problem wouldn’t have emerged today. Dengue is another result of this garbage problem. The rate payer pays rates for garbage collection and disposal. If the council has no proper plan for garbage they also cannot penalise the rate payer. Today we have over 100 engineers in the Council and we privatise garbage collection and disposal.   The low-income houses are another aspect I’m considering. If every district has officials looking after the area, then under whose advice or assistance do these unauthorised structures come up daily? It’s all politically motivated. If you are from a low income family I would encourage you to build a separate house because I’m sure of your vote. But after a few years you need to be fed, provided with basic amenities such as roofing sheets and also with ‘pin padi’ (A dole) – which is received by 13,000 people in the city. This is just a political hub of one party and the rate payers are maintaining Colombo for this party to win.    QDoes it mean that the UNP has not found any practical solution for the past 60 years?  Yes. I’m directly challenging the party’s Mayoral Candidate. She is talking about a greener Colombo, but her answer to mitigate the mosquito menace is to cut down huge trees. Who would have a heart to cut trees? How can you run a city like that? We have 13,000 people receiving ‘pin padi’ so can’t we get them to plant a tree each? We also have maternity centres and medicine clinics. We also have one laboratory and Ayurveda clinic as well in addition to all the staff that is required. If we can strengthen these establishments I’m sure we can stop the traffic congestion near the general hospitals. We have the money and the infrastructure, but the priority has been on politically motivated issues.    QBut the majority of the people have always supported the UNP. Do you still think that after all these years, they would vote for the your party this time?  It was a UNP hub. But in my area I have walked into every house unlike my opponent candidate who goes round throwing leaflets into every house.The response has been very good. The UNP was confident that the minorities were with them. I must say that I have received good feedback, especially from Muslim ladies. People in Colombo have come to realise that they get nothing out of the rates they have been paying for 60 long years. The Government has shown that they aren’t capable of delivering anything. I feel that there’s a big swing.   QThe past regime carried out various city beautification projects and they appeared to be practical in front of the citizens. But why do you think people voted for the present regime instead?  I wasn’t politically involved when it happened, but I believe that they trusted a lot of wrong people. I think Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR) didn’t take appropriate actions when he had to take them. The correct message wasn’t conveyed to him, at times.    QAs you said earlier, you have voiced out on corruption and malpractices. The present regime has appointed various commissions to probe into these matters. What are your views?  The Government appointed commissions one month before the elections. Thajudeen or Lasantha cannot be brought back. They started investigations, but it was stuck somewhere. The people who were rumoured to be involved in these cases were never questioned to begin with. MR and Namal were accused of having accounts in Dubai and so on. So why can’t they question the accused? The opposition now has enough evidence to probe into corrupt practices that have been taking place for the past three years.    QHow confident are you that you will win?  I’m 100% confident. I’m challenging my opponent and I’m going to defeat her in her own Ward. If she doesn’t win her own Ward she can’t be Mayor. I as a woman I would like to be a woman Mayor of Colombo, but I wouldn’t just want to be the first woman Mayor of Colombo. If I can be the Mayor of Colombo who has worked for the city after 60 years, who has built up a greener, healthier and an IT-friendly city and if people say that all this was done by a woman, I would be the happiest. I’m also sure that I can be that person as well. I strongly feel that a Mayor is not just an administrator. We have a staff comprising highly educated engineers and also those people who collect garbage. We have a very strong political wing which is represented by different political parties. The Mayor has to be someone who is good in administration and also someone who has a political background."
"International Infection Prevention Week Prevention better than cure","2018-10-19 11:26:26							0						 				2791"," International Infection Prevention Week (IIPV) falls onto the 3rd week of October annually. According to the World Health Organization, infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in developing countries and the second major cause of death worldwide, after cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, infections have the ability to cause major damage to an individual as well as the society as a whole. That is why we decided to consult Dr. Kushlani Jayatilleke, Consultant Microbiologist, Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital and President of the Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists, in this week’s Health Capsule to enlighten readers about the exceedingly timely topic of infection prevention.InfectionsBefore talking about prevention of infections, it is important to identify what an infection is. An infection is a disease condition caused by a micro organism which is not visible to the naked eye. Our body contains more micro organisms than it contains human cells, most of which actually help us, so not all these micro organisms are harmful. Infections can be categorised in a number of ways. These infections can be classified as bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal. They can also be grouped according to the site of the infection; infections in the upper respiratory tract as upper respiratory infections, infections in the urinary tract as urinary infections etc. Infections on the superficial parts of the body are called superficial infections, while the infections in deep structures like bones and joints are called deep infections. Spread of infectionInfections have survived through the passage of time by spreading from one person to another. Contrary to what people believe in, the mode of the spreading of the disease differs according to the organism and the infection that it causes. Respiratory tract infections are commonly spread through air droplets that are released when the patient coughs or sneezes. Also, if the patient sneezes to the open hand, then shakes hands with another person without washing his hand the second person can get contaminated. Organisms causing infections in our digestive system commonly enter the body through food and water that are contaminated by infected faecal matter. In addition, flies too can spread infection in the digestive system through contaminating food. There are infections which are chiefly transmitted through sexual contact. Syphillis, gonrrhoea and HIV are examples.Some other infections are spread through blood given from outside, as in unsafe transfusions, (which are extremely rare in Sri Lanka due to safety precautions) and in reusing needles contaminated with blood from an infected patient, or in healthcare setting and contaminated needle prick injuries.There are some other infections where the pathogenic organism is transferred from one person’s body to another by a vector. Dengue, which is causing much devastation in our country, and Malaria are examples.  Prevention of infectionsAs the spread of the infections is individualised to the type of infection, it stands to reason that the methods of prevention of the spread of the organisms also differ according to the infection.In preventing the spread of respiratory infections and infections like chickenpox which are spread through droplets, it’s important to avoid crowds where you can infect the others with the disease. Usually the first symptoms to appear in these infections are fever and malaise, so seeking treatment early, getting diagnosed and staying at home in order to take plenty of bed rest are advisable. Since influenza in most cases resolves on its own, adequate fluid and bed rest bring the best cure. If you have a cough or are sneezing and have to be in the presence of others, the best option is to use a face mask.  Cough etiquetteIf you do not have a facemask and have to cough or sneeze in public, you have to follow what is called the ‘Cough etiquette’. If you can, cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue paper while coughing and sneezing, in order to prevent the droplets from escaping. If you do not have a tissue or a handkerchief, use the back of your arm and not the hands to cover your face, since you can easily contaminate the surfaces that you touch after coughing by accidentally touching them with your hand. Proper hygieneMany of the digestive tract infections can be prevented by using proper water sealed toilets, and by washing and drying hands well after using the washroom. Food hygiene is crucial in preventing digestive tract infections. Well cooked, home prepared meals are ideal. Even though salads are good for your health, you have to make sure to clean the raw vegetables thoroughly before preparing salads, especially during the rainy season where the vegetables can be easily contaminated by the flood of dirty water. Keeping the food covered at all times while preparing also will help prevent the contamination of food. Hands are a major tool that spread infection; therefore hand washing before preparation as well as consumption of meals is important. RefrigerationIf the food will not be consumed soon after preparation, it is advisable to store them in a refrigerator at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, since in warm countries like Sri Lanka, bacteria can multiply quickly and spoil food. Food can be reheated before they are consumed, but reheating more than once is not recommended. Alternatively, food can be refrigerated and stored in small containers as single helpings, so there is no need of reheating.Raw food and cooked food should not be shelved near one another because the raw food can contaminate the solid food. MosquitoesIn order to prevent vector borne infections like dengue, prevention of the spread of the vector is important. Checking for places where water gets collected in your surroundings and inside your house and destroying them will prevent the growth of mosquitoes through destroyal of their breeding places. While mosquito repellents might help in keeping the vector away, mosquito nets are of not much practical use especially when it comes to Dengue, since the mosquito carrying the dengue virus usually bites humans during day time.  In the hospitalHospitals are grounds which have a higher risk of giving you an infection, especially because hospitals contain many patients with a variety of infections. Therefore, don’t bring young children and immune-compromised people to hospitals unless absolutely necessary. Minimising the contact of the surfaces and objects in the hospital and washing hands soon after returning from the hospital is recommended. Blood borne infections spread through transfused blood is extremely rare now due to the vigorous screening process of donated blood before transfusing. If you have had an accidental injury from a used needle, or have had high risk sexual behaviours in the past, seeking medical advise immediately is recommended. VaccinationImmunization of children from a younger age has helped Sri Lanka prevent many vaccine preventable infections and position us among the developing countries with the best health indicators. Therefore, the timely vaccination of your child is highly recommended. In addition, there are some vaccines available in the private sector like the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine, especially for people who have low immune systems."

But not every mother and father will be ready to accept their child. Hence, the possibilities are such that a child could be abandoned for the rest of its life, sometimes at a tender age. This is why stories featuring two to three- week-old infants abandoned by the roadside are occasionally reported. While every child needs parental care and affection; in certain instances parents are not ready to give the necessary care due to various reasons. Most children never get to see their parents while some others are taken away when they are in their teens. In Sri Lanka, care homes or orphanages are actual homes to many children who are abandoned or neglected by their parents. They are brought up from the day they reach these homes, but after they reach 18 years of age, they are expected to be independent. However, many among them aren’t ready to face the society yet and often become victims again. With no support, money and guidance they are often led on to the wrong paths. Who needs to be responsible for them after they leave the places which provide them with care? Whether they are safe and what they would do afterwards are few of the many questions that begs answers.In such a backdrop, the Daily mirror  spoke to a few care leavers who related their rather heartening stories and also spoke to experts to find out what is being done and what needs to be done for the betterment of these youth.Stranded in societyOnce a child reaches its adolescent years, he or she has to leave these orphanages as per the law of the country. But the Daily mirror learned that in most instances such children are asked to leave by the age of 16 if they fail their O/L examination. The plight of care leavers is such that they are being brought up from a young age within a care home and provided with all facilities. But once they are asked to leave, most of them are not ready to face society yet. They feel stranded and become victims again. Due to the stigma associated with them, they are often misled and are provoked to take wrong turns in life. Hence girls have a tendency to end-up at a spa or a massage parlour while boys are taken to do odd jobs such as carpentry or domestic work in houses. Care leavers don’t have a valid birth certificate nor an identity card. Their addresses are usually that of their orphanage and since they don’t have a permanent address on their ID they are deprived of their basic right to vote. Amidst such a backdrop there are a few who are striving to do well in life and are hoping for a brighter future. The Daily mirror  spoke to a few of them;The plight of Dinushka*Dinushka doesn’t have both her parents and was sent to Colombo after she sat for her Ordinary Level Exam (O/Ls) in 2009. Although she has been married for five years her journey so far has had more downs than ups. “I was enrolled for a training course and sent to Colombo. I did everything on my own. I wasn’t prepared to do a job and I was financially handicapped. So I had to do a job. I was reluctant to speak to strangers, but I gained confidence. There was nobody to advise us on what we should do after we leave our homes. I remember once when I was admitted to hospital to undergo surgery I had no one beside me. It was then that I realised why everybody needs a mother in life. My husband also doesn’t have anybody and he wasn’t allowed to come inside the hospital. There is only one name in my birth certificate and the same appears in my ID as well. I don’t have a right to vote since my ID has the address of the orphanage I stayed in,” she said.A call to empower care leavers*Natasha was left at the orphanage when she was just three weeks old. “I have two brothers and a sister who were also at the orphanage. At one point my mother took me home along with my siblings, but I went through a rather traumatising experience. She beat me up and home was like hell to me. My mother didn’t take care of me at all and I had to do everything by myself. After I finished my O/Ls she attempted to force me into a marriage for money, but I escaped. I wanted to return to the home, but the authorities there didn’t allow me in since I was already 16. Thereafter I got myself enrolled at an institute offering a one year dental surgery course. There were many children from other homes working with me and we were all sent to Colombo. But we didn’t know the whereabouts and with no money in hand we were stranded. We didn’t know which bus to take and therefore walked on the streets till midnight on several occasions. We were reluctant to speak to people because they were waiting to take advantage of us. I then stayed with a relation of mine and learned to commute within Colombo. I left my family four years ago and now live alone. I was told that my birth certificate was a fake, and since there are two dates on my birth certificate and ID I still don’t know my actual age or birthday. Therefore I cannot open a bank account nor vote. The homes aren’t interested in finding out what happens to us after we leave especially in the case of girls. People are of the view that we don’t need money since we are from orphanages. The stigma we face is such that my friends have sometimes thought of taking their own lives. When I used to work I often heard the phrase ‘mung anatha nivase ewung’ (they are from orphanages) and similar derogatory remarks. It would be better if the Government could implement a plan to empower care leavers as we see it as a basic right which has been taken away from us,” she said.The term ‘anatha madama’ isn’t accurate*Ramya was left at an orphanage when she was eight-months-old. Her story is an example of how care leavers are stigmatised in society. “After I completed my Advanced Level Exam (A/Ls) I started working at a communication centre. After sometime the owner sold it to another person and he took advantage of me. He promised to send me reloads and give money for food and transport. But after a while he demanded a huge amount of money from me. So I had to spend all my savings to cover up the debt. Likewise I have faced many challenges in life. The term ‘anatha madama’ is not accurate; it is actually our home. When people realise that we don’t have parents they treat us like animals. We are labelled in society and it puts us under huge stress. We don’t have money in our bank accounts and because we are being treated in this way, we too look at society with anger. Therefore I make a humble request to everybody to accept us for who we are and allow us to lead a normal life like everybody else,” she said.Seeing opportunities through mediaI knew how people looked at us. I went to four schools and viewed society with much hatred*Nimmi was sent to an orphanage when she was 10-years-old. “We had to wear uniform. From those days I knew how people looked at us. I went to four schools and viewed society with much hatred. I used to wonder why all this happened to me and those around me. I then had to appear in courts and even the day before my O/Ls I had a hearing. I failed my O/Ls in the first attempt and I thought I should pass. I stayed at the home for an additional year and passed the exam. Although I did A/Ls I couldn’t do the subject of my choice. I wanted to study music, but I didn’t get a popular school. I then wanted to study law, but then again I thought it wouldn’t be the best bet for me. Thereafter I got in to writing and eventually was interested in media. I was lucky enough to do a course in journalism in India. I write a lot during my free time and I thought the media is the best way to stand up for our own rights and spread awareness about it. I stay at the Sarvodaya hostel. I can’t stay at a rented place because I have no money. I like to study further, but I don’t have the support nor money. When we leave the homes we don’t have a right to choose the job we like. We are just put into anything that is available, so we have to continue whether we like it or not,” she said.Facing pregnancy aloneSumudu was left at an orphanage when she was two-months-old. “After I did my A/Ls I was handed over to my mother, but I didn’t want to go. I then did a course in nursing and it was quite challenging with night shifts etc. I later came to Colombo, but didn’t have lodging. I didn’t have cash to pay the boarding fees. In the meantime I contracted dengue and I didn’t have anybody to look after me. Without parents we don’t know how to proceed in life in certain instances. For example if a girl becomes pregnant she would need her mother by her side, but in our case we have nobody. The Government needs to have a plan for those who leave orphanages; at least a plan to reconnect them with their biological parents. To date I haven’t shown my birth certificate to anyone. The ID too doesn’t have a permanent address and it’s a challenge to live with fake documents. Therefore we urge the authorities to come up with a plan for the betterment of care leavers,” she said.They are now employed at a church and are advocating for change through the Voice for Voiceless Foundation.*The true names of the interviewees have been withheld under strict condition of anonymityMapping out their futureIn her comments, Western Province Commissioner for Probation and Childcare Chandima Dissanayake said that once the children reach the age of 16 they are returned to their biological parents. “But there are instances when we cannot send them back to their homes because there have been instances when they have been raped by family members. During such instances we send them for a training course or a job and also provide accommodation. If they like to marry we allow them to proceed with their consent. In 2017 we handed over 279 children back to their guardians and these included children under 18 as well. We have also sent 15 of them for vocational training and 38 were permanently employed. If the youth are sitting for their A/Ls after they reach 18 years, they are allowed to stay at their homes and complete the exam. We don’t simply allow them to leave the orphanages because we know that they have reached an age where they are quite mischievous and stubborn,” said Dissanayake.When asked about the issue of permanent residence on IDs, she said that it depended on the way in which the form was filled. “If they just include the number and the address of the place without mentioning the name of the children’s home it will not be an issue. But in the case of a child from a certified school, if he or she doesn’t have parents then we have to include that the child is from a certified school. We also send the youth to do jobs depending on the court order. We also support unmarried girls and boys and give them food and accommodation and allow them to take up whatever job they like. When I took office there was no plan for care leavers in the Western Province, but I’m happy to say that we have already implemented an effective plan afterwards,” added Dissanayake.Foster care system the way forwardSpeaking to the Daily mirror , founder Chairman of National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), activist and legislator in child protection Professor Harendra De Silva said that institutional care isn’t the best for a child. “There are many different institutions including orphanages run by the private sector which are usually funded by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In addition to that there are state-run orphanages and institutions such as certified, demand and detention homes. Children in detention homes are above five years of age whose actions have been in conflict with the law. They may be found guilty of stealing two coconuts or for jumping over a fence to a neighbouring land etc., and therefore will have to face a jail term. Some of these children have been abandoned while the others are street children. While within these institutions they have a greater tendency to experience sexual and other forms of abuse. There have been so many such incidents in the past. There’s a huge amount of emotional abuse experienced by these children which cannot even be defined. When I was NCPA Chairman each child received Rs. 21 per day for food and other expenses and orphanages and care homes relied on alms givings and other donations in kind. However there is open mismanagement of funds and resources by the staff,” said Prof. De Silva.“In most instances orphanages ask for money and dry rations. But that is not what the children want. They would want a toy or a favourite food. Hence an evil system has been created. We aren’t trying to empower the children, but wish to enhance their self-respect. Western countries have adopted the foster care parent system which is a cheaper approach for the government as well. Here, each foster parent is given a certain amount of money to take care of the child. But the only issue here is that these foster parents should be screened because in certain instances these foster parents could be abusers or they may use children for domestic work. Hence we should establish a proper screening system for foster parents by seeking support from qualified psychologists and social workers. We are experts at showing off people who appear to be pseudo-experts and they flood the market. They appear with fake certificates and claim to be proper counsellors,” warned Prof. De Silva.Prof. De Silva further said that Sri Lanka also doesn’t have a proper monitoring system. “Once a child is in foster care there should be people who must monitor and evaluate the progress of the child. They should be able to go to school and monitor the performance, check for absenteeism and observe how the child is being treated at home. Foster parents may look at legal methods to adopt a child servant and such moves should be discouraged.During a screening the child’s health and nutritional status should also be monitored and evaluated. Another way of foster care is where the child lives with his or her biological parents, but another foster family could support them with money and resources. A few limitations of this process would be that it has to be handled by someone who knows the subject.The Government doesn’t have as many professionals from the perspective of administration.They work according to regulations and circulars and therefore things don’t happen as planned. We need good professionals who are committed to the subject and they should decide on the standards of procedures. We can seek support from Grama Niladhari and Samurdhi officers who could be trained to go from house to house to monitor the foster care process.There are probation officers in the country, but they have been appointed for political purposes.They would obey an order from the top, but will not work for the best interest of the children. In addition to that we could identify dysfunctional families and provide them with supplements. Hence there has to be a paradigm shift in the way of thinking. There’s politics everywhere, but somebody has to take a decision and this responsibility is vested upon the leadership,” he opined.Generation Never Give Up‘Generation Never Give Up’ is a platform that has been established to empower youth leaving residential care in order to create a generation that will never give up. Therefore it aims to create a safe and inclusive society, for youth leaving residential care before or after the age of 18 with the support of state and non-state stakeholders. Services provided under this platform include job opportunities and career guidance, scholarships for higher education, psychological counselling, legal support, peer support, an emergency hotline and an information database.For further details visit www.gnglk.org"

"National Dengue Prevention Week: Don’t let dengue mosquitoes sting us","2018-09-29 01:15:54							0						 				1284"," The dengue pandemic is once again trying to penetrate our nation. However, ‘The National Dengue Prevention Week’ campaign which commenced on September 26 is doing its utmost to eradicate and prevent the virus in Sri Lanka. The dengue prevention campaign is carried out jointly by the CMC, Health Ministry, Special Presidential Task Force, the Environment Police and the Tri-Forces.   Consultant Community Physician of the National Dengue Control Unit, Dr. Preshila Samaraweera, spoke about the dengue prevention week, and the programmes which are conducted throughout the week, “We conduct two national dengue control weeks every year. Usually it is conducted just before the monsoon period. When we see the pattern of dengue of patients throughout the year, there is a seasonal peak from May to July and October to January. The seasonal peak typically coincides with the South Western monsoon and the North Eastern monsoon.   We conduct our sessions in various health divisions in our country which are called MOH areas (medical officer of health division). We have 355 MOHs in Sri Lanka. We categorize those MOH areas into three considering the density and probability of dengue in that region. The categories are: priority high risk, high risk and low risk. We have had 50 priority high risk MOH areas and 125 high risk areas. The other areas are low risk. During the week we conduct programmes in the priority high risk areas on all 7 days, and 5 days for the high risk areas. During this week we get the support from the tri-forces and the police to conduct the sessions. Such personnel are allocated into teams of three. Further within the MOH areas, we select high risk grama niladari divisions. Usually a grama niladari division consists of 500-700 houses. Each team is responsible for getting the cleaning of potential breeding cleared by respective households. The teams must visit and inspect every house, institute, school, constructive site hence any potential breeding places. Post inspection they ask people to remove unwanted water holding containers that promote breeding. The teams also educate the people of the area and help them identify breeding places. The respective PHI (public health officer) will inform the Grama niladari and religious leaders in order to have shramadanas to clean the areas.”    We conduct our sessions in various health divisions in our country which are called MOH areas (medical officer of health division). We have 355 MOHs in Sri Lanka She noted that on September 28 that they have selected schools to be inspected. The education ministry has issued a circular to inspect and have a shramadana campaign in all the schools of the country. But the priority high risk area schools are inspected and cleaned with more attentiveness.   She elaborated on the status of dengue in our country in contrast to the preceding years, she said, “dengue has reduced significantly, from 150,000 (January- September 2017) to 38000 cases this year ( January- September 2018).    Many factors have contributed to this reduction. When there is a large outbreak, the trend is normally that the following years will have a reduction in cases, because many people got the disease previous year. Every 5- 6 years we have a cyclical outbreak, due to zero type change. This is because the dengue virus has 4 types. For instance when we get an infection from the type 1 virus, we would not get the type 1 virus again. But, if a person, who has already contracted the type 1 virus and is later exposed to the type-2 virus they can contract the disease again. The significance of last year was that after 9 years the type 2 virus re-entered our country. Many people have not got exposed the type-2 virus, hence this facilitated the dengue outbreak last year.”   She also said that the reduction in cases is attributed to the actions taken by the health ministry, as they have allocated 1500 labourers this year to control the breeding of mosquitos and to carry out daily inspections of specified areas. Hence, every day waste such as coconut shells, salmon tins, buckets, tyres and empty containers are cleared by such personnel. Therefore, the number of breeding places in the country would reduce.   She spoke about the dengue vaccine that was much discussed about in the previous years, “ one of the vaccines is still under trial within our own country. There is another vaccine but the advisory commission has not accepted it in our country, because there is an issue in the Philippines regarding that vaccine.”   Speaking of dengue management in hospitals in our country she said, “Usually in our country the fatality rate of dengue is very low, last year we had 186 000 dengue patients but 440 deaths. In our country we are managing dengue patients very well. It is up to the standard of other countries such as Singapore and Thailand. Such dengue riddled countries have got together and follow a similar dengue management guideline and treatment techniques. There is no specific drug however to cure dengue yet.”   In her concluding remarks she said, “ In order to efficiently manage the dengue menance we must change the behaviour of the people in our country. We have to inculcate the behaviour of disposing waste. Then only can we substantially reduce dengue in Sri Lanka. To change this behavior and the culture of our people is a major challenge we face. We do many programmes with the education ministry to educate and spread awareness to children of proper waste management practices. We want waste management to become a natural habit. Further, clearing waste should be done on a daily basis and not only when an outbreak occurs. For instance, Some homes are quite vigilant when an outbreak occurs, but afterwards they begin to neglect waste in their homes. Therefore, the key to prevention of the epidemic is through environmental management. Some homes have bird baths, ponds and stagnant water in gutters that are heavily polluted. There must be a mechanisms to maintain them. As a further prevention mechanism chemicals are being used to destroy larvae and fogging is done to kill adult mosquitoes. However, we are trying to use chemicals at a minimum because such chemicals can cause resistance and it can also cause other diseases in people.”   "
"Knowing your blood report","2018-09-26 09:59:26							0						 				406","Blood tests have become such an integral part of disease diagnosis and treatment process that when you go to a doctor, more often than not, you are asked to obtain a blood report related to your condition. That’s why we decided to bring you a series of articles to provide information regarding blood tests; ordered commonly. Dr. K.A.C. Wickramaratne, Consultant Haematologist, Senior Lecturer in Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ruhuna, answers our queries in this week’s edition of Health Capsule with regard to blood tests.   “I strongly recommend the interpretation of any laboratory test to be done by the requesting clinician”, stresses Dr. Wickramartne. He explains that this process should be followed because despite the findings can be considered normal it can sometimes be a clue to a disease. Therefore, getting test reports interpreted by any person other than the one who requested it is of serious concern and should be avoided for the safety of the patients. Also, each laboratory test should ideally be requested by a doctor following a thorough history and a physical examination of the patient, so that only the relevant lab tests are requested. A Full Blood Count, the most commonly requested haematology test globally, is the topic discussed in this week’s edition of Health Capsule.   What is FBC?Full Blood Count (FBC) or Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a very useful test for the diagnosis of diverse conditions. Full or complete is a relative term as newer machines come with more and more added parameters with unique advantages in diagnosis. Even though it bears simple three letters FBC, it is a battery of tests with diverse information of blood cells. Nowadays, the test is done using fully automated analyzers.To understand what FBC is, we should know first what is analysed in this test. Blood can be separated into a liquid part plasma and solid – formed elements cells. FBC analyzes these cells.   Red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes) are analyzed in machines mainly to show how much of these cells are present per unit volume of blood. In addition, it gives some qualitative parametres such as changes in cell size, presence of abnormal cells, and presence of young or immature cells and even predicts the possibility of presence of some unique diseases such as Dengue fever in some cases.   How do I prepare for a FBC?A blood sample for a FBC can be given at any time of the day. It is collected as a random sample. However, early morning is ideal for any test. But changes throughout the day are subtle and are therefore of no concern. However, physical exertion, some drugs (such as prednisolone), smoking etc can affect FBC results, so are worth notifying your doctor when he is interpreting the results. It is better to give the sample after about 20 min rest if you were walking briskly.   Blood collection is best performed without a tourniquet. If a tourniquet is applied it should be applied immediately before venipuncture and removed within a minute. Blood from a vein, rather than from an artery is taken, as is the case with many tests. The sample will be perfect if venipuncture is neat, if the blood is drawn in to a syringe without much effort and without any bubbles, if the correct volume is filled into the tube; where a special agent to keep the blood from clotting, is pre-added, and mixed gently by 5-6 inversions. Samples, when transported and stored at temperatures between 21 – 27 0 C, can be analysed even after 48 hours to obtain accurate FBC results.   What is the information that can be garnered from a FBC?Results of the lab test and clinical manifestations of the disease should always be analysed together.Red cell parametresThese include Haemoglobin concentration (Hb - amount of oxygen carrying pigment) and red cell count (RBC or RCC) per unit volume of blood and haematocrit (HCT) or packed red cell volume (PCV) a measure of total red cell volume per unit volume of blood as a percentage].Normal values (or more accurately the reference values) of these parametres vary between different age groups, sexes and during certain physiological states such as pregnancy. So it should be interpreted with correct reference range for age, sex and physiological status. Higher values than upper limit is called polycythemia. It is a group of disorders needing further investigations. Values below the lower limit is called anaemia. It is a manifestation of a disease, thus should be investigated. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measure of red cell size and it is very important to understand the type of anaemia. When it is high it can be vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. When it is low it can be iron deficiency or thalassaemia. Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH) is a measure of Hb content in red cells and lower values can be indicative of iron deficiency or thalassaemia.These are only a few examples of the vast amount of information that can be collected from red cell parameters.White blood cell parametersThese include total white cell count (WBC) per unit volume of blood and absolute and relative percentages of each white cell subtype [we call it differential count (DC)]. Higher or lower total number of white cells and changes in DC can indicate infections or even serious diseases such as blood cancer. The variations in DC could be indicative of simple viral infection or bacterial infections such as leptospirosis, pneumonia or urine infection. Even allergic conditions, parasitic diseases such as filariasis, can subject DC to unique changes.The WBC count and DC can change with physical exertion, smoking or some drugs such as prednisolone. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when interpreting WBC parameters as well.   Platelets   Platelets are needed for stoppage of bleeding when we have wounds. The number of platelets per unit volume of blood is platelet count. Lower and higher values indicate diseases and can endanger life by spontaneous bleeding within the body or by “clot” formation in brain etc respectively. Platelet parametres available in automated FBC give clues on progression of platelet disorders.   Can we compare FBC results of different laboratories?The comparison of results between different laboratories cannot be done and should be discouraged unless the laboratories use similar machines and similar procedures. We call it standardisation and is yet to be established in Sri Lanka. When monitoring of FBC is needed with regard to a patient, it has to be done from the same laboratory throughout the monitoring process. Looking for any accreditation status ISO 15189 or CAP would give additional security or trust on quality or the reliability of what you receive as the FBC report. The presence of consultants to supervise and presence of qualified MLTs in a medical clinical laboratory is very important.Is it good to get FBC done as a routine on our own?As we have previously mentioned, any test when requested, should have a purpose and should be interpreted by a qualified doctor.   It has to be linked with symptoms, signs, age, sex, physiological status etc.  Just reading counts and comparing it with references given is inadequate and can mislead. This can happen when patients try to get reports interpreted by laboratory personnel or blood collection officials (phlebotomists). In a laboratory haematologists or pathologists, doctors or consultants related to laboratory medicine with relevant training can interpret FBC parameters. Other laboratory personnel are not qualified and competent to interpret these within the clinical context.  Unless clinician recommends and educates you to monitor your counts, obtaining random counts and getting them interpreted by an unqualified person is therefore inadvisable.   Can FBC results be erroneous?Yes. In any part of the world even with strict quality control, random errors are possible, but rare. Accredited laboratories try to control all potential errors. Most of the errors associated with FBC are due to errors in the sample collection and processing before analysis. If we elaborate a little on this, a traumatic venipuncture, froth formation (air bubbling inside syringe), pushing blood into the tube through a needle, vigorous shaking of tube with blood, exposure of blood to very high temperatures and marked delays in analysis all can affect FBC parameters adversely. Frequently falsely low platelets counts are seen due to these errors.   To generate accurate results, all the FBC machines should be properly installed, calibrated and maintained as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality control should be available for daily runs as well as external quality assurance at regular intervals. The availability of external and internal quality is not sufficient unless they monitor, review and act on results of quality control. Qualified, trained and competent laboratory personnel are therefore mandatory.  As for the possibility of a laboratory to perform any other test from the same sample, the answer would be ‘yes’. Commonly a sample collected for FBC can be used to perform blood picture, ESR, malaria or any other blood parasites examination, HbA1c (a test useful to monitor diabetes), blood grouping, reticulocyte count and Hb electrophoresis etc.   In a nutshell, FBC is a battery of investigations giving clues on how healthy your blood cells are. When used wisely it gives a large amount of information for the clinician for proper diagnosis and care. Quality of FBC results depend on many factors and collection errors are the most important. Remember not to rely on ‘interpreters’ of FBC (or any other test report) for your health. It should be done by a qualified doctor. When you select a laboratory for FBC (or any other test) accreditation status, presence of qualified team including presence of Haematologists to supervise are good points to remember.  "

"POLITICAL CIRCUS HITS TOWN Leaders in suites, drunken supporters fallen on streets","2018-09-11 00:10:07							0						 				1402","  	Thousands want to see there is quick action to punish the corrupt	This was an election promise that has to be kept at all costs, whatever the circumstances may be It was a circus all right, acrobats, jugglers and jumpers galore, while mothers were afraid to send their children to school, workers stayed away from their workplaces, some offices closed early. The organisers of the protest were unconcerned about the loss to children of education, loss to the economy by offices being closed.Their only focus was on themselves and getting back to the grandeur of power. Far from bringing the government down, many JO supporters were seen fallen in drunken stupors, lying on streets, some rescued by the ambulances introduced with the help of India by this government and hospitalized. One man died later of a heart attack. It was good to see few women among the supporters transported to Colombo who was gifted with packets of Chicken Biriyani, packets of cigarettes and arrack.It showed that the female of the species is wiser and far harder to fool than the male!Their promise to bring 200,000 supporters was just their usual boastful talk, they could only muster about 20,000 supporters.Namal Rajapaksa and Dilan Perera have never been famed as mental heavyweights, so their ridiculous statements after the circus was over, far ahead of the break of dawn, should not be taken seriously. The tax authorities should question the sourcing of the funds used for this and where they came from.One wonders why there were no verbal attacks on this charade of a protest and the inconvenience caused to the public, by those three prosperous, well-fed businessmen, robber barons as they were named in the media, who vented their wrath and fury against the Government, in no uncertain terms at a fireside chat recently. Namal Rajapaksa and Dilan Perera have never been famed as mental heavyweights, so their ridiculous statements after the circus was over, far ahead of the break of dawn, should not be taken seriously. The tax authorities should question the sourcing of the funds used for this and where they came fromOne of them openly called for a dictatorship. His benefits from dictators earlier on are no secret. Do they condone the white vans, abductions, murders and the rampant unprecedented level of corruption in the Rajapaksa regime?Another bemoaned the fact that government servants were given an increase in salaries while businessmen were taxed to the hilt.Still, another spoke about takeovers which had been done by the previous government but gave the impression that it was the fault of the present one.Perhaps age has dimmed his brain. It seems a pity that their wisdom hasn’t increased along with their bank balances. There are none so blind that those who will not see! I must commend the comments by Dhammika Perera and Merrill J Fernando in this context. I would like to know from the first three I mentioned whether they would have dared to hurl these attacks at the time the Rajapaksa family were ruling the country. I dread to think of what their fate would have been.They are going far beyond the peripheries of freedom, now in existence and abusing it like some in the media do too.The previous government did not focus on education; perhaps as many of them are uneducated, they value brawn more than the development of the brain. This government has increased the Mahapola allowance to Rs 4,000/-, given laptops to schoolchildren, built new buildings for 9,000 schools all over the country, given insurance to schoolchildren.So much investment has been to ensure an educated future generation which can take the country forward with the desired intellectual ability to do so. There have been over 137 housing projects launched under the leadership of Sajith Premadasa by this government.The fact that the government allowed the protest is again, a tribute to the freedom and democracy that exists today. This in sharp contrast to the protest during the Rajapaksa regime at Rathupaswala, in which several protestors were killed.The citizens of Colombo followed the lead of the government led by the President and the Prime Minister in ignoring the protest, no cheering squads form Colombo lined the roads.Lands are continuing to be returned to rightful owners in the North and in the South too, this is being done to those who lost theirs through the injustice of one kind or another. The fact that the government allowed the protest is again, a tribute to the freedom and democracy that exists today. This in sharp contrast to the protest during the Rajapaksa regime at Rathupaswala, in which several protestors were killedThere has been a vast creation of employment, prices of medicines reduced, salaries increased. The percentage of those affected by dengue in Colombo has dropped by 64% in comparison with 2017. There is no vulgar extravagance in public spending. No VIP of the government has used public funds for memorials for their families. VIP’s wives and sons do not fly to N’Eliya for baths or to ride their horses.To my mind, what thousands of others including me want to see, is that there is quick action to punish the corrupt in the former regimeand in this too if they are guilty of corruption.That is my grouse. Slow action in that respect. This was an election promise that has to be kept at all costs, whatever the circumstances may be. We also have Nihal of CJC fame jumping in like a Bull in a China Shop to give his professorial bill a hand, in stating that there was no impediment in the pseudo-Emperor contesting the Presidency again.The latter has unfortunately not changed his clothes, literally or metaphorically and Nihal may find that visions of CJC become more than a blast from the past in the minds of the people.Political Leaders must act like Statesman with dignity and fortitude through all seasons, “..meet with both triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same.”The Prime Minister has been the epitome of this throughout his political life, a worthy example to the second string of young leaders he has groomed in the UNP."

International Infection Prevention Week Prevention better than cure,"2018-10-19 11:26:26							0						 				2785","�International Infection Prevention Week (IIPV) falls onto the 3rd week of October annually. According to the World Health Organization, infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in developing countries and the second major cause of death worldwide, after cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, infections have the ability to cause major damage to an individual as well as the society as a whole. That is why we decided to consult Dr. Kushlani Jayatilleke, Consultant Microbiologist, Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital and President of the Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists, in this week�s Health Capsule to enlighten readers about the exceedingly timely topic of infection prevention.InfectionsBefore talking about prevention of infections, it is important to identify what an infection is. An infection is a disease condition caused by a micro organism which is not visible to the naked eye. Our body contains more micro organisms than it contains human cells, most of which actually help us, so not all these micro organisms are harmful.�Infections can be categorised in a number of ways. These infections can be classified as bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal. They can also be grouped according to the site of the infection; infections in the upper respiratory tract as upper respiratory infections, infections in the urinary tract as urinary infections etc. Infections on the superficial parts of the body are called superficial infections, while the infections in deep structures like bones and joints are called deep infections.�Spread of infectionInfections have survived through the passage of time by spreading from one person to another. Contrary to what people believe in, the mode of the spreading of the disease differs according to the organism and the infection that it causes. Respiratory tract infections are commonly spread through air droplets that are released when the patient coughs or sneezes. Also, if the patient sneezes to the open hand, then shakes hands with another person without washing his hand the second person can get contaminated.�Organisms causing infections in our digestive system commonly enter the body through food and water that are contaminated by infected faecal matter. In addition, flies too can spread infection in the digestive system through contaminating food.�There are infections which are chiefly transmitted through sexual contact. Syphillis, gonrrhoea and HIV are examples.Some other infections are spread through blood given from outside, as in unsafe transfusions, (which are extremely rare in Sri Lanka due to safety precautions) and in reusing needles contaminated with blood from an infected patient, or in healthcare setting and contaminated needle prick injuries.There are some other infections where the pathogenic organism is transferred from one person�s body to another by a vector. Dengue, which is causing much devastation in our country, and Malaria are examples.��Prevention of infectionsAs the spread of the infections is individualised to the type of infection, it stands to reason that the methods of prevention of the spread of the organisms also differ according to the infection.In preventing the spread of respiratory infections and infections like chickenpox which are spread through droplets, it�s important to avoid crowds where you can infect the others with the disease. Usually the first symptoms to appear in these infections are fever and malaise, so seeking treatment early, getting diagnosed and staying at home in order to take plenty of bed rest are advisable.�Since influenza in most cases resolves on its own, adequate fluid and bed rest bring the best cure. If you have a cough or are sneezing and have to be in the presence of others, the best option is to use a face mask.��Cough etiquetteIf you do not have a facemask and have to cough or sneeze in public, you have to follow what is called the �Cough etiquette�. If you can, cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue paper while coughing and sneezing, in order to prevent the droplets from escaping. If you do not have a tissue or a handkerchief, use the back of your arm and not the hands to cover your face, since you can easily contaminate the surfaces that you touch after coughing by accidentally touching them with your hand.�Proper hygieneMany of the digestive tract infections can be prevented by using proper water sealed toilets, and by washing and drying hands well after using the washroom. Food hygiene is crucial in preventing digestive tract infections. Well cooked, home prepared meals are ideal. Even though salads are good for your health, you have to make sure to clean the raw vegetables thoroughly before preparing salads, especially during the rainy season where the vegetables can be easily contaminated by the flood of dirty water. Keeping the food covered at all times while preparing also will help prevent the contamination of food.�Hands are a major tool that spread infection; therefore hand washing before preparation as well as consumption of meals is important.�RefrigerationIf the food will not be consumed soon after preparation, it is advisable to store them in a refrigerator at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, since in warm countries like Sri Lanka, bacteria can multiply quickly and spoil food. Food can be reheated before they are consumed, but reheating more than once is not recommended. Alternatively, food can be refrigerated and stored in small containers as single helpings, so there is no need of reheating.Raw food and cooked food should not be shelved near one another because the raw food can contaminate the solid food.�MosquitoesIn order to prevent vector borne infections like dengue, prevention of the spread of the vector is important. Checking for places where water gets collected in your surroundings and inside your house and destroying them will prevent the growth of mosquitoes through destroyal of their breeding places. While mosquito repellents might help in keeping the vector away, mosquito nets are of not much practical use especially when it comes to Dengue, since the mosquito carrying the dengue virus usually bites humans during day time.��In the hospitalHospitals are grounds which have a higher risk of giving you an infection, especially because hospitals contain many patients with a variety of infections. Therefore, don�t bring young children and immune-compromised people to hospitals unless absolutely necessary. Minimising the contact of the surfaces and objects in the hospital and washing hands soon after returning from the hospital is recommended.�Blood borne infections spread through transfused blood is extremely rare now due to the vigorous screening process of donated blood before transfusing. If you have had an accidental injury from a used needle, or have had high risk sexual behaviours in the past, seeking medical advise immediately is recommended.�VaccinationImmunization of children from a younger age has helped Sri Lanka prevent many vaccine preventable infections and position us among the developing countries with the best health indicators. Therefore, the timely vaccination of your child is highly recommended. In addition, there are some vaccines available in the private sector like the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine, especially for people who have low immune systems."

But that is not what the children want. They would want a toy or a favourite food. Hence an evil system has been created. - Professor Harendra De Silva	There are many different institutions including orphanages run by the private sector	In 2017 we handed over 279 children back to their guardians	Limitations in adapting the foster care systemEvery child born to this world has a mother and a father. But not every mother and father will be ready to accept their child. Hence, the possibilities are such that a child could be abandoned for the rest of its life, sometimes at a tender age. This is why stories featuring two to three- week-old infants abandoned by the roadside are occasionally reported. While every child needs parental care and affection; in certain instances parents are not ready to give the necessary care due to various reasons. Most children never get to see their parents while some others are taken away when they are in their teens. In Sri Lanka, care homes or orphanages are actual homes to many children who are abandoned or neglected by their parents. They are brought up from the day they reach these homes, but after they reach 18 years of age, they are expected to be independent. However, many among them aren�t ready to face the society yet and often become victims again. With no support, money and guidance they are often led on to the wrong paths. Who needs to be responsible for them after they leave the places which provide them with care? Whether they are safe and what they would do afterwards are few of the many questions that begs answers.In such a backdrop, the Daily mirror� spoke to a few care leavers who related their rather heartening stories and also spoke to experts to find out what is being done and what needs to be done for the betterment of these youth.Stranded in societyOnce a child reaches its adolescent years, he or she has to leave these orphanages as per the law of the country. But the Daily mirror learned that in most instances such children are asked to leave by the age of 16 if they fail their O/L examination. The plight of care leavers is such that they are being brought up from a young age within a care home and provided with all facilities. But once they are asked to leave, most of them are not ready to face society yet. They feel stranded and become victims again. Due to the stigma associated with them, they are often misled and are provoked to take wrong turns in life. Hence girls have a tendency to end-up at a spa or a massage parlour while boys are taken to do odd jobs such as carpentry or domestic work in houses. Care leavers don�t have a valid birth certificate nor an identity card. Their addresses are usually that of their orphanage and since they don�t have a permanent address on their ID they are deprived of their basic right to vote. Amidst such a backdrop there are a few who are striving to do well in life and are hoping for a brighter future. The Daily mirror� spoke to a few of them;The plight of Dinushka*Dinushka doesn�t have both her parents and was sent to Colombo after she sat for her Ordinary Level Exam (O/Ls) in 2009. Although she has been married for five years her journey so far has had more downs than ups. �I was enrolled for a training course and sent to Colombo. I did everything on my own. I wasn�t prepared to do a job and I was financially handicapped. So I had to do a job. I was reluctant to speak to strangers, but I gained confidence. There was nobody to advise us on what we should do after we leave our homes. I remember once when I was admitted to hospital to undergo surgery I had no one beside me. It was then that I realised why everybody needs a mother in life. My husband also doesn�t have anybody and he wasn�t allowed to come inside the hospital. There is only one name in my birth certificate and the same appears in my ID as well. I don�t have a right to vote since my ID has the address of the orphanage I stayed in,� she said.A call to empower care leavers*Natasha was left at the orphanage when she was just three weeks old. �I have two brothers and a sister who were also at the orphanage. At one point my mother took me home along with my siblings, but I went through a rather traumatising experience. She beat me up and home was like hell to me. My mother didn�t take care of me at all and I had to do everything by myself. After I finished my O/Ls she attempted to force me into a marriage for money, but I escaped. I wanted to return to the home, but the authorities there didn�t allow me in since I was already 16. Thereafter I got myself enrolled at an institute offering a one year dental surgery course. There were many children from other homes working with me and we were all sent to Colombo. But we didn�t know the whereabouts and with no money in hand we were stranded. We didn�t know which bus to take and therefore walked on the streets till midnight on several occasions. We were reluctant to speak to people because they were waiting to take advantage of us. I then stayed with a relation of mine and learned to commute within Colombo. I left my family four years ago and now live alone. I was told that my birth certificate was a fake, and since there are two dates on my birth certificate and ID I still don�t know my actual age or birthday. Therefore I cannot open a bank account nor vote. The homes aren�t interested in finding out what happens to us after we leave especially in the case of girls. People are of the view that we don�t need money since we are from orphanages. The stigma we face is such that my friends have sometimes thought of taking their own lives. When I used to work I often heard the phrase �mung anatha nivase ewung� (they are from orphanages) and similar derogatory remarks. It would be better if the Government could implement a plan to empower care leavers as we see it as a basic right which has been taken away from us,� she said.The term �anatha madama� isn�t accurate*Ramya was left at an orphanage when she was eight-months-old. Her story is an example of how care leavers are stigmatised in society. �After I completed my Advanced Level Exam (A/Ls) I started working at a communication centre. After sometime the owner sold it to another person and he took advantage of me. He promised to send me reloads and give money for food and transport. But after a while he demanded a huge amount of money from me. So I had to spend all my savings to cover up the debt. Likewise I have faced many challenges in life. The term �anatha madama� is not accurate; it is actually our home. When people realise that we don�t have parents they treat us like animals. We are labelled in society and it puts us under huge stress. We don�t have money in our bank accounts and because we are being treated in this way, we too look at society with anger. Therefore I make a humble request to everybody to accept us for who we are and allow us to lead a normal life like everybody else,� she said.Seeing opportunities through mediaI knew how people looked at us. I went to four schools and viewed society with much hatred*Nimmi was sent to an orphanage when she was 10-years-old. �We had to wear uniform. From those days I knew how people looked at us. I went to four schools and viewed society with much hatred. I used to wonder why all this happened to me and those around me. I then had to appear in courts and even the day before my O/Ls I had a hearing. I failed my O/Ls in the first attempt and I thought I should pass. I stayed at the home for an additional year and passed the exam. Although I did A/Ls I couldn�t do the subject of my choice. I wanted to study music, but I didn�t get a popular school. I then wanted to study law, but then again I thought it wouldn�t be the best bet for me. Thereafter I got in to writing and eventually was interested in media. I was lucky enough to do a course in journalism in India. I write a lot during my free time and I thought the media is the best way to stand up for our own rights and spread awareness about it. I stay at the Sarvodaya hostel. I can�t stay at a rented place because I have no money. I like to study further, but I don�t have the support nor money. When we leave the homes we don�t have a right to choose the job we like. We are just put into anything that is available, so we have to continue whether we like it or not,� she said.Facing pregnancy aloneSumudu was left at an orphanage when she was two-months-old. �After I did my A/Ls I was handed over to my mother, but I didn�t want to go. I then did a course in nursing and it was quite challenging with night shifts etc. I later came to Colombo, but didn�t have lodging. I didn�t have cash to pay the boarding fees. In the meantime I contracted dengue and I didn�t have anybody to look after me. Without parents we don�t know how to proceed in life in certain instances. For example if a girl becomes pregnant she would need her mother by her side, but in our case we have nobody. The Government needs to have a plan for those who leave orphanages; at least a plan to reconnect them with their biological parents. To date I haven�t shown my birth certificate to anyone. The ID too doesn�t have a permanent address and it�s a challenge to live with fake documents. Therefore we urge the authorities to come up with a plan for the betterment of care leavers,� she said.They are now employed at a church and are advocating for change through the Voice for Voiceless Foundation.*The true names of the interviewees have been withheld under strict condition of anonymityMapping out their futureIn her comments, Western Province Commissioner for Probation and Childcare Chandima Dissanayake said that once the children reach the age of 16 they are returned to their biological parents. �But there are instances when we cannot send them back to their homes because there have been instances when they have been raped by family members. During such instances we send them for a training course or a job and also provide accommodation. If they like to marry we allow them to proceed with their consent. In 2017 we handed over 279 children back to their guardians and these included children under 18 as well. We have also sent 15 of them for vocational training and 38 were permanently employed. If the youth are sitting for their A/Ls after they reach 18 years, they are allowed to stay at their homes and complete the exam. We don�t simply allow them to leave the orphanages because we know that they have reached an age where they are quite mischievous and stubborn,� said Dissanayake.When asked about the issue of permanent residence on IDs, she said that it depended on the way in which the form was filled. �If they just include the number and the address of the place without mentioning the name of the children�s home it will not be an issue. But in the case of a child from a certified school, if he or she doesn�t have parents then we have to include that the child is from a certified school. We also send the youth to do jobs depending on the court order. We also support unmarried girls and boys and give them food and accommodation and allow them to take up whatever job they like. When I took office there was no plan for care leavers in the Western Province, but I�m happy to say that we have already implemented an effective plan afterwards,� added Dissanayake.Foster care system the way forwardSpeaking to the Daily mirror , founder Chairman of National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), activist and legislator in child protection Professor Harendra De Silva said that institutional care isn�t the best for a child. �There are many different institutions including orphanages run by the private sector which are usually funded by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In addition to that there are state-run orphanages and institutions such as certified, demand and detention homes. Children in detention homes are above five years of age whose actions have been in conflict with the law. They may be found guilty of stealing two coconuts or for jumping over a fence to a neighbouring land etc., and therefore will have to face a jail term. Some of these children have been abandoned while the others are street children. While within these institutions they have a greater tendency to experience sexual and other forms of abuse. There have been so many such incidents in the past. There�s a huge amount of emotional abuse experienced by these children which cannot even be defined. When I was NCPA Chairman each child received Rs. 21 per day for food and other expenses and orphanages and care homes relied on alms givings and other donations in kind. However there is open mismanagement of funds and resources by the staff,� said Prof. De Silva.�In most instances orphanages ask for money and dry rations. But that is not what the children want. They would want a toy or a favourite food. Hence an evil system has been created. We aren�t trying to empower the children, but wish to enhance their self-respect. Western countries have adopted the foster care parent system which is a cheaper approach for the government as well. Here, each foster parent is given a certain amount of money to take care of the child. But the only issue here is that these foster parents should be screened because in certain instances these foster parents could be abusers or they may use children for domestic work. Hence we should establish a proper screening system for foster parents by seeking support from qualified psychologists and social workers. We are experts at showing off people who appear to be pseudo-experts and they flood the market. They appear with fake certificates and claim to be proper counsellors,� warned Prof. De Silva.Prof. De Silva further said that Sri Lanka also doesn�t have a proper monitoring system. �Once a child is in foster care there should be people who must monitor and evaluate the progress of the child. They should be able to go to school and monitor the performance, check for absenteeism and observe how the child is being treated at home. Foster parents may look at legal methods to adopt a child servant and such moves should be discouraged.During a screening the child�s health and nutritional status should also be monitored and evaluated. Another way of foster care is where the child lives with his or her biological parents, but another foster family could support them with money and resources. A few limitations of this process would be that it has to be handled by someone who knows the subject.The Government doesn�t have as many professionals from the perspective of administration.They work according to regulations and circulars and therefore things don�t happen as planned. We need good professionals who are committed to the subject and they should decide on the standards of procedures. We can seek support from Grama Niladhari and Samurdhi officers who could be trained to go from house to house to monitor the foster care process.There are probation officers in the country, but they have been appointed for political purposes.They would obey an order from the top, but will not work for the best interest of the children. In addition to that we could identify dysfunctional families and provide them with supplements. Hence there has to be a paradigm shift in the way of thinking. There�s politics everywhere, but somebody has to take a decision and this responsibility is vested upon the leadership,� he opined.Generation Never Give Up�Generation Never Give Up� is a platform that has been established to empower youth leaving residential care in order to create a generation that will never give up. Therefore it aims to create a safe and inclusive society, for youth leaving residential care before or after the age of 18 with the support of state and non-state stakeholders. Services provided under this platform include job opportunities and career guidance, scholarships for higher education, psychological counselling, legal support, peer support, an emergency hotline and an information database.For further details visit www.gnglk.org"

They may be found guilty of stealing two coconuts or for jumping over a fence to a neighbouring land etc., and therefore will have to face a jail term. Some of these children have been abandoned while the others are street children. While within these institutions they have a greater tendency to experience sexual and other forms of abuse. There have been so many such incidents in the past. There�s a huge amount of emotional abuse experienced by these children which cannot even be defined. When I was NCPA Chairman each child received Rs. 21 per day for food and other expenses and orphanages and care homes relied on alms givings and other donations in kind. However there is open mismanagement of funds and resources by the staff,� said Prof. De Silva.��In most instances orphanages ask for money and dry rations. But that is not what the children want. They would want a toy or a favourite food. Hence an evil system has been created. We aren�t trying to empower the children, but wish to enhance their self-respect. Western countries have adopted the foster care parent system which is a cheaper approach for the government as well. Here, each foster parent is given a certain amount of money to take care of the child. But the only issue here is that these foster parents should be screened because in certain instances these foster parents could be abusers or they may use children for domestic work. Hence we should establish a proper screening system for foster parents by seeking support from qualified psychologists and social workers. We are experts at showing off people who appear to be pseudo-experts and they flood the market. They appear with fake certificates and claim to be proper counsellors,� warned Prof. De Silva.�Prof. De Silva further said that Sri Lanka also doesn�t have a proper monitoring system. �Once a child is in foster care there should be people who must monitor and evaluate the progress of the child. They should be able to go to school and monitor the performance, check for absenteeism and observe how the child is being treated at home. Foster parents may look at legal methods to adopt a child servant and such moves should be discouraged.�During a screening the child�s health and nutritional status should also be monitored and evaluated. Another way of foster care is where the child lives with his or her biological parents, but another foster family could support them with money and resources. A few limitations of this process would be that it has to be handled by someone who knows the subject.�The Government doesn�t have as many professionals from the perspective of administration.�They work according to regulations and circulars and therefore things don�t happen as planned. We need good professionals who are committed to the subject and they should decide on the standards of procedures. We can seek support from Grama Niladhari and Samurdhi officers who could be trained to go from house to house to monitor the foster care process.�There are probation officers in the country, but they have been appointed for political purposes.�They would obey an order from the top, but will not work for the best interest of the children. In addition to that we could identify dysfunctional families and provide them with supplements. Hence there has to be a paradigm shift in the way of thinking. There�s politics everywhere, but somebody has to take a decision and this responsibility is vested upon the leadership,� he opined.�Generation Never Give Up�Generation Never Give Up� is a platform that has been established to empower youth leaving residential care in order to create a generation that will never give up. Therefore it aims to create a safe and inclusive society, for youth leaving residential care before or after the age of 18 with the support of state and non-state stakeholders. Services provided under this platform include job opportunities and career guidance, scholarships for higher education, psychological counselling, legal support, peer support, an emergency hotline and an information database.��For further details visit www.gnglk.org�"
National Dengue Prevention Week: Don�t let dengue mosquitoes sting us,"2018-09-29 01:15:54							0						 				1280","�The dengue pandemic is once again trying to penetrate our nation. However, �The National Dengue Prevention Week� campaign which commenced on September 26 is doing its utmost to eradicate and prevent the virus in Sri Lanka. The dengue prevention campaign is carried out jointly by the CMC, Health Ministry, Special Presidential Task Force, the Environment Police and the Tri-Forces.� �Consultant Community Physician of the National Dengue Control Unit, Dr. Preshila Samaraweera, spoke about the dengue prevention week, and the programmes which are conducted throughout the week, �We conduct two national dengue control weeks every year. Usually it is conducted just before the monsoon period. When we see the pattern of dengue of patients throughout the year, there is a seasonal peak from May to July and October to January. The seasonal peak typically coincides with the South Western monsoon and the North Eastern monsoon.� �We conduct our sessions in various health divisions in our country which are called MOH areas (medical officer of health division). We have 355 MOHs in Sri Lanka. We categorize those MOH areas into three considering the density and probability of dengue in that region. The categories are: priority high risk, high risk and low risk. We have had 50 priority high risk MOH areas and 125 high risk areas. The other areas are low risk. During the week we conduct programmes in the priority high risk areas on all 7 days, and 5 days for the high risk areas. During this week we get the support from the tri-forces and the police to conduct the sessions. Such personnel are allocated into teams of three. Further within the MOH areas, we select high risk grama niladari divisions. Usually a grama niladari division consists of 500-700 houses. Each team is responsible for getting the cleaning of potential breeding cleared by respective households. The teams must visit and inspect every house, institute, school, constructive site hence any potential breeding places. Post inspection they ask people to remove unwanted water holding containers that promote breeding. The teams also educate the people of the area and help them identify breeding places. The respective PHI (public health officer) will inform the Grama niladari and religious leaders in order to have shramadanas to clean the areas.�� ��We conduct our sessions in various health divisions in our country which are called MOH areas (medical officer of health division). We have 355 MOHs in Sri Lanka�She noted that on September 28 that they have selected schools to be inspected. The education ministry has issued a circular to inspect and have a shramadana campaign in all the schools of the country. But the priority high risk area schools are inspected and cleaned with more attentiveness.� �She elaborated on the status of dengue in our country in contrast to the preceding years, she said, �dengue has reduced significantly, from�150,000 (January- September 2017) to 38000 cases this year ( January- September 2018).� ��Many factors have contributed to this reduction. When there is a large outbreak, the trend is normally that the following years will have a reduction in cases, because many people got the disease previous year. Every 5- 6 years we have a cyclical outbreak, due to zero type change. This is because the dengue virus has 4 types. For instance when we get an infection from the type 1 virus, we would not get the type 1 virus again. But, if a person, who has already contracted the type 1 virus and is later exposed to the type-2 virus they can contract the disease again. The significance of last year was that after 9 years the type 2 virus re-entered our country. Many people have not got exposed the type-2 virus, hence this facilitated the dengue outbreak last year.�� �She also said that the reduction in cases is attributed to the actions taken by the health ministry, as they have allocated 1500 labourers this year to control the breeding of mosquitos and to carry out daily inspections of specified areas. Hence, every day waste such as coconut shells, salmon tins, buckets, tyres and empty containers are cleared by such personnel. Therefore, the number of breeding places in the country would reduce.� �She spoke about the dengue vaccine that was much discussed about in the previous years, � one of the vaccines is still under trial within our own country. There is another vaccine but the advisory commission has not accepted it in our country, because there is an issue in the Philippines regarding that vaccine.�� �Speaking of dengue management in hospitals in our country she said, �Usually in our country the fatality rate of dengue is very low, last year we had 186 000 dengue patients but 440 deaths. In our country we are managing dengue patients very well. It is up to the standard of other countries such as Singapore and Thailand. Such dengue riddled countries have got together and follow a similar dengue management guideline and treatment techniques. There is no specific drug however to cure dengue yet.�� �In her concluding remarks she said, � In order to efficiently manage the dengue menance we must change the behaviour of the people in our country. We have to inculcate the behaviour of disposing waste. Then only can we substantially reduce dengue in Sri Lanka. To change this behavior and the culture of our people is a major challenge we face. We do many programmes with the education ministry to educate and spread awareness to children of proper waste management practices. We want waste management to become a natural habit. Further, clearing waste should be done on a daily basis and not only when an outbreak occurs. For instance, Some homes are quite vigilant when an outbreak occurs, but afterwards they begin to neglect waste in their homes. Therefore, the key to prevention of the epidemic is through environmental management. Some homes have bird baths, ponds and stagnant water in gutters that are heavily polluted. There must be a mechanisms to maintain them. As a further prevention mechanism chemicals are being used to destroy larvae and fogging is done to kill adult mosquitoes. However, we are trying to use chemicals at a minimum because such chemicals can cause resistance and it can also cause other diseases in people.�� �"
Knowing your blood report,"2018-09-26 09:59:26							0						 				402","Blood tests have become such an integral part of disease diagnosis and treatment process that when you go to a doctor, more often than not, you are asked to obtain a blood report related to your condition. That�s why we decided to bring you a series of articles to provide information regarding blood tests; ordered commonly. Dr. K.A.C. Wickramaratne, Consultant Haematologist, Senior Lecturer in Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ruhuna, answers our queries in this week�s edition of Health Capsule with regard to blood tests.� ��I strongly recommend the interpretation of any laboratory test to be done by the requesting clinician�, stresses Dr. Wickramartne. He explains that this process should be followed because despite the findings can be considered normal it can sometimes be a clue to a disease. Therefore, getting test reports interpreted by any person other than the one who requested it is of serious concern and should be avoided for the safety of the patients. Also, each laboratory test should ideally be requested by a doctor following a thorough history and a physical examination of the patient, so that only the relevant lab tests are requested. A Full Blood Count, the most commonly requested haematology test globally, is the topic discussed in this week�s edition of Health Capsule.� �What is FBC?Full Blood Count (FBC) or Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a very useful test for the diagnosis of diverse conditions. Full or complete is a relative term as newer machines come with more and more added parameters with unique advantages in diagnosis. Even though it bears simple three letters FBC, it is a battery of tests with diverse information of blood cells. Nowadays, the test is done using fully automated analyzers.To understand what FBC is, we should know first what is analysed in this test. Blood can be separated into a liquid part plasma and solid � formed elements cells. FBC analyzes these cells.� �Red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes) are analyzed in machines mainly to show how much of these cells are present per unit volume of blood. In addition, it gives some qualitative parametres such as changes in cell size, presence of abnormal cells, and presence of young or immature cells and even predicts the possibility of presence of some unique diseases such as Dengue fever in some cases.� �How do I prepare for a FBC?A blood sample for a FBC can be given at any time of the day. It is collected as a random sample. However, early morning is ideal for any test. But changes throughout the day are subtle and are therefore of no concern. However, physical exertion, some drugs (such as prednisolone), smoking etc can affect FBC results, so are worth notifying your doctor when he is interpreting the results. It is better to give the sample after about 20 min rest if you were walking briskly.� �Blood collection is best performed without a tourniquet. If a tourniquet is applied it should be applied immediately before venipuncture and removed within a minute. Blood from a vein, rather than from an artery is taken, as is the case with many tests. The sample will be perfect if venipuncture is neat, if the blood is drawn in to a syringe without much effort and without any bubbles, if the correct volume is filled into the tube; where a special agent to keep the blood from clotting, is pre-added, and mixed gently by 5-6 inversions. Samples, when transported and stored at temperatures between 21 � 27 0 C, can be analysed even after 48 hours to obtain accurate FBC results.� �What is the information that can be garnered from a FBC?Results of the lab test and clinical manifestations of the disease should always be analysed together.Red cell parametresThese include Haemoglobin concentration (Hb - amount of oxygen carrying pigment) and red cell count (RBC or RCC) per unit volume of blood and haematocrit (HCT) or packed red cell volume (PCV) a measure of total red cell volume per unit volume of blood as a percentage].Normal values (or more accurately the reference values) of these parametres vary between different age groups, sexes and during certain physiological states such as pregnancy. So it should be interpreted with correct reference range for age, sex and physiological status. Higher values than upper limit is called polycythemia. It is a group of disorders needing further investigations. Values below the lower limit is called anaemia. It is a manifestation of a disease, thus should be investigated.�Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measure of red cell size and it is very important to understand the type of anaemia. When it is high it can be vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. When it is low it can be iron deficiency or thalassaemia. Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH) is a measure of Hb content in red cells and lower values can be indicative of iron deficiency or thalassaemia.These are only a few examples of the vast amount of information that can be collected from red cell parameters.White blood cell parametersThese include total white cell count (WBC) per unit volume of blood and absolute and relative percentages of each white cell subtype [we call it differential count (DC)]. Higher or lower total number of white cells and changes in DC can indicate infections or even serious diseases such as blood cancer. The variations in DC could be indicative of simple viral infection or bacterial infections such as leptospirosis, pneumonia or urine infection. Even allergic conditions, parasitic diseases such as filariasis, can subject DC to unique changes.The WBC count and DC can change with physical exertion, smoking or some drugs such as prednisolone. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when interpreting WBC parameters as well.� �Platelets� �Platelets are needed for stoppage of bleeding when we have wounds. The number of platelets per unit volume of blood is platelet count. Lower and higher values indicate diseases and can endanger life by spontaneous bleeding within the body or by �clot� formation in brain etc respectively. Platelet parametres available in automated FBC give clues on progression of platelet disorders.� �Can we compare FBC results of different laboratories?The comparison of results between different laboratories cannot be done and should be discouraged unless the laboratories use similar machines and similar procedures. We call it standardisation and is yet to be established in Sri Lanka. When monitoring of FBC is needed with regard to a patient, it has to be done from the same laboratory throughout the monitoring process. Looking for any accreditation status ISO 15189 or CAP would give additional security or trust on quality or the reliability of what you receive as the FBC report. The presence of consultants to supervise and presence of qualified MLTs in a medical clinical laboratory is very important.Is it good to get FBC done as a routine on our own?As we have previously mentioned, any test when requested, should have a purpose and should be interpreted by a qualified doctor.�� It has to be linked with symptoms, signs, age, sex, physiological status etc.� Just reading counts and comparing it with references given is inadequate and can mislead. This can happen when patients try to get reports interpreted by laboratory personnel or blood collection officials (phlebotomists). In a laboratory haematologists or pathologists, doctors or consultants related to laboratory medicine with relevant training can interpret FBC parameters. Other laboratory personnel are not qualified and competent to interpret these within the clinical context.� Unless clinician recommends and educates you to monitor your counts, obtaining random counts and getting them interpreted by an unqualified person is therefore inadvisable.� �Can FBC results be erroneous?Yes. In any part of the world even with strict quality control, random errors are possible, but rare. Accredited laboratories try to control all potential errors. Most of the errors associated with FBC are due to errors in the sample collection and processing before analysis. If we elaborate a little on this, a traumatic venipuncture, froth formation (air bubbling inside syringe), pushing blood into the tube through a needle, vigorous shaking of tube with blood, exposure of blood to very high temperatures and marked delays in analysis all can affect FBC parameters adversely. Frequently falsely low platelets counts are seen due to these errors.� �To generate accurate results, all the FBC machines should be properly installed, calibrated and maintained as per the manufacturer�s instructions. Quality control should be available for daily runs as well as external quality assurance at regular intervals. The availability of external and internal quality is not sufficient unless they monitor, review and act on results of quality control. Qualified, trained and competent laboratory personnel are therefore mandatory. �As for the possibility of a laboratory to perform any other test from the same sample, the answer would be �yes�. Commonly a sample collected for FBC can be used to perform blood picture, ESR, malaria or any other blood parasites examination, HbA1c (a test useful to monitor diabetes), blood grouping, reticulocyte count and Hb electrophoresis etc.� �In a nutshell, FBC is a battery of investigations giving clues on how healthy your blood cells are. When used wisely it gives a large amount of information for the clinician for proper diagnosis and care. Quality of FBC results depend on many factors and collection errors are the most important. Remember not to rely on �interpreters� of FBC (or any other test report) for your health. It should be done by a qualified doctor. When you select a laboratory for FBC (or any other test) accreditation status, presence of qualified team including presence of Haematologists to supervise are good points to remember.��"

"POLITICAL CIRCUS HITS TOWN Leaders in suites, drunken supporters fallen on streets","2018-09-11 00:10:07							0						 				1398","��	Thousands want to see there is quick action to punish the corrupt	This was an election promise that has to be kept at all costs, whatever the circumstances may be�It was a circus all right, acrobats, jugglers and jumpers galore, while mothers were afraid to send their children to school, workers stayed away from their workplaces, some offices closed early. The organisers of the protest were unconcerned about the loss to children of education, loss to the economy by offices being closed.Their only focus was on themselves and getting back to the grandeur of power. Far from bringing the government down, many JO supporters were seen fallen in drunken stupors, lying on streets, some rescued by the ambulances introduced with the help of India by this government and hospitalized. One man died later of a heart attack. It was good to see few women among the supporters transported to Colombo who was gifted with packets of Chicken Biriyani, packets of cigarettes and arrack.It showed that the female of the species is wiser and far harder to fool than the male!Their promise to bring 200,000 supporters was just their usual boastful talk, they could only muster about 20,000 supporters.Namal Rajapaksa and Dilan Perera have never been famed as mental heavyweights, so their ridiculous statements after the circus was over, far ahead of the break of dawn, should not be taken seriously. The tax authorities should question the sourcing of the funds used for this and where they came from.One wonders why there were no verbal attacks on this charade of a protest and the inconvenience caused to the public, by those three prosperous, well-fed businessmen, robber barons as they were named in the media, who vented their wrath and fury against the Government, in no uncertain terms at a fireside chat recently.�Namal Rajapaksa and Dilan Perera have never been famed as mental heavyweights, so their ridiculous statements after the circus was over, far ahead of the break of dawn, should not be taken seriously. The tax authorities should question the sourcing of the funds used for this and where they came fromOne of them openly called for a dictatorship. His benefits from dictators earlier on are no secret. Do they condone the white vans, abductions, murders and the rampant unprecedented level of corruption in the Rajapaksa regime?Another bemoaned the fact that government servants were given an increase in salaries while businessmen were taxed to the hilt.Still, another spoke about takeovers which had been done by the previous government but gave the impression that it was the fault of the present one.Perhaps age has dimmed his brain. It seems a pity that their wisdom hasn�t increased along with their bank balances. There are none so blind that those who will not see! I must commend the comments by Dhammika Perera and Merrill J Fernando in this context. I would like to know from the first three I mentioned whether they would have dared to hurl these attacks at the time the Rajapaksa family were ruling the country. I dread to think of what their fate would have been.They are going far beyond the peripheries of freedom, now in existence and abusing it like some in the media do too.The previous government did not focus on education; perhaps as many of them are uneducated, they value brawn more than the development of the brain. This government has increased the Mahapola allowance to Rs 4,000/-, given laptops to schoolchildren, built new buildings for 9,000 schools all over the country, given insurance to schoolchildren.So much investment has been to ensure an educated future generation which can take the country forward with the desired intellectual ability to do so. There have been over 137 housing projects launched under the leadership of Sajith Premadasa by this government.The fact that the government allowed the protest is again, a tribute to the freedom and democracy that exists today. This in sharp contrast to the protest during the Rajapaksa regime at Rathupaswala, in which several protestors were killed.The citizens of Colombo followed the lead of the government led by the President and the Prime Minister in ignoring the protest, no cheering squads form Colombo lined the roads.Lands are continuing to be returned to rightful owners in the North and in the South too, this is being done to those who lost theirs through the injustice of one kind or another.�The fact that the government allowed the protest is again, a tribute to the freedom and democracy that exists today. This in sharp contrast to the protest during the Rajapaksa regime at Rathupaswala, in which several protestors were killedThere has been a vast creation of employment, prices of medicines reduced, salaries increased. The percentage of those affected by dengue in Colombo has dropped by 64% in comparison with 2017. There is no vulgar extravagance in public spending. No VIP of the government has used public funds for memorials for their families. VIP�s wives and sons do not fly to N�Eliya for baths or to ride their horses.To my mind, what thousands of others including me want to see, is that there is quick action to punish the corrupt in the former regimeand in this too if they are guilty of corruption.That is my grouse. Slow action in that respect. This was an election promise that has to be kept at all costs, whatever the circumstances may be.�We also have Nihal of CJC fame jumping in like a Bull in a China Shop to give his professorial bill a hand, in stating that there was no impediment in the pseudo-Emperor contesting the Presidency again.The latter has unfortunately not changed his clothes, literally or metaphorically and Nihal may find that visions of CJC become more than a blast from the past in the minds of the people.Political Leaders must act like Statesman with dignity and fortitude through all seasons, �..meet with both triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same.�The Prime Minister has been the epitome of this throughout his political life, a worthy example to the second string of young leaders he has groomed in the UNP."

Concerning our lifespan from womb to tomb, and even further in case of illegitimate conceptions or illegal exhumations, Sri Lanka Police is entrusted with the bounden duty of shouldering the constitutional responsibility and ensuring the safety of the general public of our motherland.Adopting the Buddhist words of wisdom, �Dhammo hawe rakkhathi� dhammachari� (One who lives with the Dhamma is protected by the Dhamma) as its motto, while wearing the emblem bearing a dauntless tusker in the middle and the dharma chakra (Dharma Wheel) on the head, Sri Lanka Police is dedicated towards maintaining law and order while safeguarding lives and property of all Sri Lankans.This is considered to be one of the major organizations among the three State institutions, which were initially established in this country and its glorious history and the 152nd anniversary is thus celebrated with great vim and gusto.Sri Lanka Police also marks the inception of the first security service in Sri Lanka. The history of the security service of this country goes back to the reign of King Pandukabhaya and this service owes its origin to the position named, Nagara Guththika. It has gradually evolved up to the Dutch and Portuguese eras. After occupying the maritime areas of the country in 1796, the British established a Police Service in this country.The Police Force was further streamlined under the regulations imposed by the Act bearing No. 14 passed under the British Crown in 1806 and at the time the Police Force consisted of 28 Police Force Constables.�""This is considered to be one of the major organizations among the three State institutions, which were initially established in this country and its glorious history and the 152nd anniversary is thus celebrated with great vim and gusto""Payment of salaries to the Police Force was made with effect from July 9, 1833.�Then, 47 Police Stations were established centred on commercial cities and 585 Police Officers were deployed for city protection duties.The Maradana Police Station was recorded in history as the First Police Station to be established in this manner.With the appointment of Mr George William Robinson Campbell as the first Inspector General of Police on September 3, 1966, as per the provisions of the Police Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, the inauguration of the Police Service as an organization in this country took place Constitutionally.The said date has been declared as the Police Day. Since the appointment of Sir Richard Aluvihare on January 6, 1947, as the first Sri Lankan Inspector General of Police, the occidental aura emanated from the Police Service has begun to be overpowered by the Sri Lankan spirit.At present, Sri Lanka Police functions under the Ministry of Public Administration and Law & Order and has become a solid Government institution, which consists of 64 Functional Divisions, 42 Territorial Divisions, 491 Police Stations with a strength of more than 90,000 Police Officers.The term �Polis� has been derived from the French language and it means, �The guardian of the civil administration�.There is no other public institution than Police organization, which faces greater challenges in a country, where the civil administration is in effect due to the absence of internal disputes.The Sri Lanka Police, which has encountered three internal civil disputes, has faced many daunting challenges subsequent to the war situation prevailed for three decades in North Eastern Provinces.The duties of a Police organization in other countries are investigation of crimes, crime prevention, maintenance of law and order and traffic management.However, the professional role of a Sri Lankan Police officer is played in a more complex way.In addition to the basic police duties such as crime investigation, crime prevention, maintenance of law and order and traffic management, the citizens of the country currently expect the police to perform tasks such as implementing laws on liquor and narcotics, prevention of communicable diseases like dengue, protection of forests, coastal conservation, wildlife conservation, prevention of illegal sand mining and illegal excavation, even though there are separate Government bodies which are functioning to implement such environmental laws.At present, even the safety of the railway crossings is ensured under Police supervision. Thus, the duty of the police officer has become extremely complex.�On the other hand, it brings us great pleasure to think of the sense of confidence Sri Lanka Police has inspired in the Executive, the Legislature and the general public for choosing us to assign a significant share of all these tasks.In other countries, usually, the Police officers are not assigned to other duties.However, the Sri Lankan Police are deployed for the performance of other duties and a different structure has been designed for that purpose. The officers of Sri Lanka Police are discharging those duties on a daily basis and sometimes even the officers of the Special Task Force, which is the elite paramilitary forces unit of Sri Lanka Police, might assume the role of a valiant soldier, while discharging ordinary Police duties.Sri Lanka Police that has inherited a proud history of 152 years, is offering many services covering various fields to more than twenty million Sri Lankans.Protecting lives and property of Sri Lankan citizens, Sri Lanka Police have presently become a bosom friend of the general public and it stands upright like a giant tree above a thick canopy of praise, blame, commendation and criticism while confronting all the difficulties and challenges around the clock in both sun and rain.The number of Police Stations that was 437 in 2015 have been increased up to 492 to date by the present Inspector General of Police, Mr Pujith Jayasundara, who pays special attention towards improving the basic facilities and service facilities necessary to fulfil the public needs efficiently by bridging the gap between the public and police.�This provided a great relief for the people who had to travel a long way with great difficulty to get services from Police.New Police Stations have been established by further segmenting some of the larger Police Divisions.�This has further reduced the population density of a respective Police Station and therefore those people have been able to get their services more efficiently.Furthermore, taking measures to develop human and physical resources in Sri Lanka Police with the intention of ensuring the security of the society in a peaceful country can be perceived as a huge achievement of the citizens of this country.This becomes evident when analyzing statistical data of 15 years in which the tendency to talk about criminal incidents have increased. Criminal incidents were also reported during the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 when compared to the present.�However, since news articles on war had occupied more space on newspapers, incidents of crimes did not attract much public attention then.After 2009, headlines related to war had been replaced with headlines about criminal incidents, creating a basis for discussion. That is not a factor which should be construed as an increase in crimes.�""The number of Police Stations that was 437 in 2015 have been increased up to 492 to date by the present Inspector General of Police, Mr Pujith Jayasundara, who pays special attention towards improving the basic facilities and service facilities necessary to fulfil the public needs efficiently by bridging the gap between the public and police""Through the application of modern technology for investigating crimes, Sri Lanka Police has been able to initiate a significant development in the field of investigation.A great assistance is being given by Scene of Crime Officers (SOCO) who have undergone a proper training, officers and hounds of Police Kennels Division, Fingerprint Officers and Photographers of Police Criminal Records Division to facilitate the investigations and to identify criminals.At a time when the entire world is shrinking into a small global village, even the criminals in our country have gained access to the modern technology under globalization and show a tendency to employ modern technology and communication methods to commit crimes.Confronted with the challenge of protecting people from those who commit organized crimes, while being members of crime networks, Criminal Investigations Department is taking measures to shoulder their responsibility and all Police Stations of the Island are also extending a great support in that regard.May Sri Lanka Police endure through time executing its legendary mission!The writer is an Attorney-at-law, Police Media Spokesman and the Director and of the Police Media Division."
"To Dr. Ramya Kumar�s Article Doctors, MOH, Free Education et al","2018-08-21 00:04:05							0						 				1386","Right of ReplyRead with much interest a response to my article of July 27, 2018, in particular and to most other articles of mine on the health sector and medical profession in the DM, titled �Do away with Medical Officers of Health? A response to Kusal Perera� by Dr. Ramya Kumar, an academic in the Medical Faculty of the University of Jaffna. Appreciate very much the initiative to engage in discussion on this very vital topic that most have kept away to date.��Reading through Dr. Ramya Kumar�s response, I feel there is some misreading of what I have been arguing and making observations on, and that needs brief clarifications and explanations.��1) Dr. Kumar says in �yet another article� I have been �slamming the medical profession�, implying I have always been �slamming the medical profession�. In conclusion, Dr. Kumar says �I urge Perera to separate his contempt for the medical profession and the Government Medical Officers� Association(GMOA) from his analysis of the public health sector�..���I have always been holding the GMOA leadership as a �medical mafia�. I would continue to do so, until and unless the GMOA leadership changes course to play a responsible, civilized role within the health sector and in society. As for the medical profession, yes, I do say, it is no more the �noble profession� it was. As a �profession� the medical profession has over the past decades given up its moral and ethical standards and is no more different to all other corrupt professions; the legal, accounting, engineering, the academia etc. Yet I do accept there are very good medical doctors as very good lawyers, engineers, accountants, academics et al. Where I hold �good doctors� at fault is on their silence and their reluctance to stand up to the GMOA mafia. My �criticism of the medical profession and the private practise is valid� says Dr. Kumar.��2) Yet Dr. Kumar says ��his writings are confused and often unsubstantiated�. A point made is that, my �antipathy to the medical profession� led me to �undermine the students� call to protect �free� education�. I was thus supporting the government�s effort to privatize medical education says Dr. Kumar, �taking a questionable position on SAITM�.Glad Dr. Kumar raised this issue of �free education� along with �private medical education�. My position on �free education� had nothing to do with simplified sloganizing of �free education� by not only the students, but by the academics and the GMOA too. �Free education� in the anti SAITM protests was only a popular cover for the very sectarian demand by GMOA.� �My position on �free education� is based on �Sessional Papers No.43 of 1944�, commonly known as �Kannangara Reforms�. Sadly, most in the �anti-SAITM� campaign did not know what this �Sessional Paper� is about and those gullible students brought on to Colombo streets have not even seen a copy of it. In June 1944, when it was adopted by the State Council, there were over 1,100 private schools managed by Missionaries and the Buddhist Theosophical Society along with State owned �government� schools. �Kannangara Reforms� never ever proposed to �nationalize� these private schools. It never proposed education �free of charge�. It allowed even government schools to levy �facilities fees�. Private schools that could not afford a well paid tutorial staff was �assisted by government�. All schools levied fees, with government schools not making it compulsory.� ��Free education� was NOT �free of charge� education as these students and Dr. Kumar would want to believe.Today we have more than 44 totally private schools (including Chundikuli Girls� School) within our national education system, even after PM Bandaranaike�s government in 1962 nationalized a vast majority of assisted and private schools. Pupils in these private schools are taught the same curriculum and the same syllabi. They sit the same G.C.E O/L and A/L exams with all other students from government schools and compete for admissions to all faculties in State universities.� ��Free education and private medical education issues raised as �matters of life and death� have no relevance and validity in the context of present day education�The call against private medical education Dr. Ramya Kumar stands with, has no validity with eight medical faculty Deans sitting in the SLMC accepting and registering private medical colleges and universities for Sri Lankan students to graduate as medical doctors with only the ERPM (another tuition industry monopolised by medical doctors) required to practise medicine and join government service. Is it where the private medical college is located that decides �privatizing of medical education�? If private medical education is opposed on principle, why wasn�t the KDA fee levying medical faculty opposed along with SAITM?��Free education and private medical education issues raised as �matters of life and death� have no relevance and validity in the context of present day education where everything has been com-modified with absolutely no protests from any quarter during the last 30 years and more. Private companies own �International schools� that have yet to be opposed by this fake �Free education� campaigners. Nor do they question, the massive private tuition industry that makes a mockery of Kannangara Reforms that established a �national education system�, accepted the �right to education� with equal opportunities on a level playing field. The role of the State was to create that opportunity for the majority who could not afford such education to their children.� �Let�s also not forget,those who fight to safeguard �free education� never speak nor oppose fee levying courses in their own universities and the academia that sympathized and supported student campaigns never avoided teaching in these fee levying courses for extra income. They also ignore all foreign university degrees offered and privately tutored here and professional degrees and diplomas from private institutes and organizations held valid in local employment.� �There always was a market-based education sector that had expanded without limits within the �free market economy� and without any opposition from �free education� campaigners.��3) The present role of the position �MOH� and that of the medical doctors holding that position needs serious dialogue. Dr. Kumar�s details as to why and how the British colonial rulers came to establish a Medical Officer Health (MOH) post in preventive healthcare is accepted and is history.The 50�s and the 60�s, was when even politicians were honourable men and women unlike today. Not only the MOH, everyone else in the health service from top to bottom were duty conscious and discharged their duties honestly. The whole public sector was that then. Monitoring of field work then came under an OIC who was a Senior PHI in the MOH division. This responsibility was brought under the MOH from around 1964.��My assumption, Medical Doctors of �today� as MOH have failed miserably in their discharge of duties, with spread of Dengue used as one example is based not only on numbers I quoted, but on pathetically degenerated professionalism and politics of the GMOA that results in medical officers as MOH neglecting their duties and responsibilities. The claim by Dr. Kumar that �They oversee service delivery at the community level, including maternal and child health, family planning, and communicable and non-communicable disease prevention, while carrying out medical consultations at maternal and child health clinics� is therefore the point of contention. Except attending maternal and child health clinics, MOH is an almost absent officer in all else. They are comfortable remote controlling all monitoring work from their offices. May be Jaffna is different, as noted by Dr. Kumar.� �Rapid and unplanned urbanisation mentioned as reason for recent spread of dengue, is only half true with MOH rarely seen or heard in most anti dengue campaigns carried out with police personnel, Local Government Councillors and DS office personnel. It is a fact that dengue cannot be successfully controlled without community support and participation. It is also a fact, community support and participation have to be mobilized by MOH and his staff. That is what goes missing with medical doctors as MOH. Their ego with the �tie and the stethoscope� do not allow them in the field as the PHI and the Public Family Health Officers (Mid wives) do.��True the post of MOH is no glamourous post for medical doctors. But that gives them enough time for PP in their own area, especially in rural society. And in Colombo and suburbs that provides them an added reason to demand �National schools� for their children.� �As for my proposal to shift medical doctors posted as MOH to area GP work, does not in anyway reflect �Colombo dinner table talk�. That also does not replace the medical doctor with para medics in curative health. Instead it provides people with a government GP in their own area, they now have to pay for, unless they go to a government hospital, where the OPD often doesn�t run for more than three hours a day. Well trained para-medics for community preventive healthcare, is one I borrowed from J.H.L Cumpston (Director General, Health Services of Australia) who was commissioned by then Ceylon government and whose Report in 1950 explains the rational for it. Yet it was only a proposal, and is open for dialogue, without doubt."

New acquisitions weigh on Hemas 1Q bottom line,"2018-08-16 00:02:20							0						 				1119","The recent new acquisitions weighed on the bottom line of the diversified conglomerate Hemas PLC during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 (1Q19), the interim financial accounts released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.The earnings for the quarter under review fell 20.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.554.3 million, on revenue of Rs.13.5 billion, up 21.3 percent YoY.The earnings per share for the period fell to 96 cents, from Rs.1.21.Hemas Group CEO Steven Enderby said the reduced interest income due to the utilization of cash reserves to acquire Atlas Axillia was a key reason for the reduction in earnings during the quarter.The finance income for the quarter under review fell 57 percent YoY to�Rs.95.4 million.He also identified higher interest costs relating to higher working capital due to the strong growth in pharmaceutical distribution and loan financing for the group�s new logistics park as another key reason that hampered the group�bottom line.�The finance costs for the period rose 66 percent YoY to Rs.119.21 million.��All three of these investments should contribute to earnings from 3Q,� Enderby said.The group operating profit for the quarter under review grew only by 3.5 percent YoY to�Rs.895.7 million.�The operating profit growth has been impacted by losses at N*Able, our IT technology solutions business, coupled with a weaker macroeconomic environment with sluggish consumer demand as disposable incomes have been dampened by the rising costs from rupee depreciation and increased taxes,� Enderby said.The group�s consumer business revenue stood at Rs.5.4 billion for period under review, up 36.2 percent YoY. The growth in the consumer sector, excluding Atlas, stands at 6.8 percent. The operating profit of the segment grew 8.1 percent YoY Rs.569.3 million.Hemas said during the quarter under review, the market conditions domestically remain depressed with most market commentaries indicating low or negative growth in most major�FMCG categories.The group�s Bangladesh business experienced revenue growth of 6.1 percent, following the Kumarika relaunch last December. However, Enderby said profitability still remains a challenge due to the heavy marketing spend post-launch.�The group said Atlas performance has been on track in 1Q with revenues up by 8.8 percent over last year and break even in operating profits in line with its normal seasonal performance trend.The revenue of the group�s healthcare segment rose 24.7 percent YoY to Rs.6.4 billion but the operating profit fell 2 percent YoY to Rs.498.8 million.�Hemas said the price regulations brought in for certain pharmaceutical drugs and depreciation of the rupee against the dollar was a major operational challenge it had to face during the quarter under review.The hospitals run by Hemas saw 60 percent occupancy during the period but the revenues and profitability were flat compared to the same quarter, last year, when the occupancy levels were higher due to the dengue epidemic.�The group�s pharmaceutical manufacturing and marketing subsidiary Morison posted revenue of Rs.844.3 million and operating profit of Rs.83 million for the quarter under review.�Meanwhile, Hemas leisure, travel and aviation business recorded total revenue of Rs.792.4 million reflecting a growth of 16.2 percent for the three months under consideration. The segment was also able to narrow its operating loss to Rs.68.1 million, from Rs.127.6 million a year ago.The group�s logistics and maritime business recorded a revenue growth of 15.4 percent YoY to Rs.718.3 million. The operating profit improved to Rs.216.6 million, from Rs.188 million a year ago.During this period, the Colombo port witnessed a YoY growth of 15 percent.The Esufally family has a 61 percent stake in Hemas through various investment vehicles, while Norges Bank, Norway�s giant wealth fund operating under its Central Bank, has a 2.99 percent stake in the company.Franklin Templeton Fund also has a 9.7 percent stake in Hemas.During 1Q19, the two new entrants to the top 20 shareholders of Hemas were Phoenix Venture (Pvt.)

Right of reply Do away with Medical Officers of Health? A response to Kusal Perera,"2018-08-16 00:00:01							0						 				1668","Two weeks ago, the , on July 27, 2018, carried yet another article by Kusal Perera slamming the medical profession. In this piece, Perera argues that increasing the number of medical doctors by establishing new state medical faculties will be useless because the doctors they produce will occupy redundant administrative positions in the public sector. Perera attributes �the continuing decline in the health service� to medical doctors holding administrative positions like the Medical Officer of Health (MOH), a position that he suggests should be done away with, and be replaced by trained paramedical workers.� ��	The MOH is not a glamorous position in the medical hierarchy which places hospital-based specialists�at the apex	�	I have met a number�of dynamic MOHs�working tirelessly with�limited resources�While elements of Perera�s argument are compelling, such as his condemnation of the autocratic nature of the medical establishment and his critique of public sector doctors engaging in private practice, Perera�s social positioning and his deep-seated contempt for the medical profession blinds him to the critical role played by the MOH in the preventive health sector.� ���MOH and the health system�The MOH is a vestige of the health units system introduced in British Ceylon by the Rockefeller Foundation who arrived on the island in the early 20th century to deal with the hookworm scourge on tea plantations. Disgruntled by an uncooperative Planters� Association, the Rockefeller Foundation shifted its sanitary efforts to the Western Province where the inaugural health unit was set up in Kalutara in 1926.� �The health units system gradually expanded to cover the entire island. Serving the demands of imperial medicine, medical doctors were assigned to health units where they worked towards promoting maternal and child health and preventing the spread of communicable diseases. Thus medical doctors did not usurp the MOH position in the 1970s as per Perera�s argument.� �At present, the country is divided into 330 plus MOH areas, each led by a MOH.These areas are further split into Public Health Inspector Areas, which, in turn, are divided into Public Health Midwife areas, each (ideally) covering a population of ~3000 to 5000. The MOH teams up with a public health nursing sister, public health nurses, public health inspectors and public health midwives, to deliver preventive health services in the relevant MOH Area.� �The MOH is not a glamorous position in the medical hierarchy which places hospital-based specialists at the apex. Yet, these doctors are essentially the linchpin of the preventive health sector, coordinating between MOH public health teams and district level health administrators. They oversee service delivery at the community level, including maternal and child health, family planning, and communicable and non-communicable disease prevention, while carrying out medical consultations at maternal and child health clinics. They also play a crucial role in disease notification, the School Health Programme and other community-based health education initiatives, and are responsible for food sanitation, and occupational and environmental health.� �Admittedly, many of these functions are not carried out optimally owing to crippling staff shortages at all levels. Cadre positions lie vacant in many remote and rural areas. In the Northern Province, for example, field midwives often cover two public health midwife areas, with grave implications for public health. As Perera points out, the Government needs to invest much more in this system.� ���Misplaced criticism�Perera suggests that we do away with the MOHs as it is �a wholly irrelevant position in community life.� He attributes the rise in dengue to the incompetency of MOHs. It is unclear on what basis he makes these claims. It is well recognised that dengue is a product of rapid and unplanned urbanisation compounded by a crisis in garbage disposal. The health sector cannot do very much about the spread of dengue without the necessary support from government and non-health sectors. It is farfetched to attribute the failure of the preventive sector vis-�-vis dengue, the resurgence of leprosy, and even a lack of sanitary facilities,to MOHs being doctors.� �Moreover, Perera�s allegations do little justice to the many socially minded MOHs who do not engage in private practice. While working in the health sector, I have met a number of dynamic MOHs working tirelessly with limited resources. In addition to running primary care clinics and overseeing the work of public health inspectors and public health midwives, they have been responsible for initiating various health promoting activities within their respective MOH areas. Examples from Jaffna District include the promotion of organic home gardening and the use of a nutritious mix of grains and cereals (�saththa maa�) manufactured locally to address malnutrition, which is rampant in the Northern Province. While Perera labels such activities as completely irrelevant, he unwittingly contradicts his own position that prevention is better than cure.� �Also notably absent in Perera�s analysis are the successes of the preventive health sector in spite of medical doctors holding positions of administration. For instance, its role in the much proclaimed low maternal mortality ratio and, more recently, WHO certification for malaria elimination. Despite such achievements, financial allocations to the preventive sector have declined over the years as more and more funds are channeled toward curative care. Rather than focusing solely on doctors, Perera should expose the Government�s role in Sri Lanka�s health sector crisis.� ���Need for clarity�Perera�s criticism of the medical profession and private practice is valid. However, his writings are confused and often unsubstantiated. For instance, during the SAITM crisis and student boycott, Perera�s antipathy to the medical profession led him to undermine the students� call to protect �free education.� In fact, he supported the government�s efforts to privatise medical education by taking a questionable position on SAITM.��His latest article (Daily Mirror,� August 10th 2018), an attack of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, suggests that the joint statement of Deans of state medical faculties on SAITM was manipulated by the Federation of Faculty of Medicine Teachers� Associations (far from the truth in most if not all medical faculties). Perera is unable to see that the establishment of for-profit medical degree-awarding institutions like SAITM could jeopardize medical education in the country.� �Many of the positions Perera articulates in his articles, including the denigration of MOHs, smack of Colombo-centric middle class elitism; trashing the public sector, including state hospitals and universities, is standard dinner table conversation in Colombo. In his pro-people analysis, Perera seems to have forgotten the ordinary families who rely on the public sector, including the MBBS qualified MOH (not a private sector specialist), for their maternal and child health needs.� ���Words of caution�Yes, medical doctors are not the �saviours and guardians� of the health sector, and they should embrace other healthcare professionals instead of obstructing their entry into the health sector. Yes, the maldistribution of medical officers should be addressed rather than placing them in administrative positions in Colombo. Having said that, however, Perera should be wary of trends in other parts of the world where physician administrators are increasingly replaced by MBA degree holders and others of that ilk who are trained to maximize cost-effectiveness and profits in the health sector. Second, Perera should think twice before supporting �task shifting,� a particularly neocolonial approach that has its basis in the assumption that poorer communities in rural and remote areas can be served by a �low cost� paramedical healthcare workforce. Finally, I urge Perera to separate his contempt for the medical profession and the Government Medical Officers� Association from his analysis of the public health sector in order to offer a more informed critique in his writings.� �[The writer is attached to the Department of Community and Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jaffna]"
Rising temperatures to carry big price tag in steamy Sri�Lanka,"2018-07-27 13:14:48							0						 				983","By Amantha Perera(Colombo) THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION: Dinesh de Alwis has lived all his life in Ratmalana, a suburb of Sri Lanka�s capital Colombo. When he was young, he remembers, he would rush outside every day at 4 p.m., to play with friends after school.�Now if you send the kids out at four, they would faint of heatstroke. It�s that bad,� said the 40-year-old father of two, of the searing heat that has become part of everyday life here.Already steamy Colombo is expected to be one of the South Asian cities hardest hit by temperature hikes linked to climate change � hikes that are already being seen in many cities around the world.As temperatures continue to rise, Sri Lanka�s Western Province � which includes Colombo � is likely to see a 7.5 percent decline in living standards by 2050 �compared with a situation without changes in average weather�, according to a World Bank report released last month.That is likely to have far-reaching national consequences as one of the nation�s key economic centres struggles to keep cool, the report said.�This is a substantial drop, with potentially large implications for the country, given that the province contributes more than 40 percent of Sri Lanka�s Gross Domestic Product (GDP),� the report said.Muthukumara Mani, a co-author of the report and the World Bank�s lead economist for South Asia, said that the impact will vary across different sections of the population, with outdoor workers or the poor unable to afford air conditioning, for instance, particularly hard hit, and energy costs rising for many.�A rich household could be in a position to mitigate the impacts better than a poorer household, which would not have the financial capacity to do that,� Mani said. He said the construction industry and health systems are likely to feel the heat in particular.Some families say they are already running up higher bills due to rising temperatures.�When we were small we never used fans. It was never so warm that you could not sleep. Now we can�t sleep most nights without the air conditioner,� said De Alwis, who said he pays close to US$70 each month for air conditioning.Sunimal Jayathunga, director of the national Climate Change Secretariat noted that the country�s �adjustment to rising temperatures has not been ideal and (has been) too slow across the board�.In the past decade Colombo and the Western Province have been beset by worsening dengue outbreaks. Research by Sri Lanka�s University of Peradeniya has shown a link between rising temperatures, changing rainfall and outbreaks of the mosquito-carried disease.According to the World Bank report, more than 800 million people in South Asia will be affected by rising temperatures by 2050 and Sri Lanka in particular will see a loss of at least US$12 billion a year by 2050 if adequate measures are not taken to deal with temperature rise.Temperatures in the region are expected to rise by up to 3 degrees by 2050, the report said.Jayathunga, of the climate secretariat, said his agency was putting together plans for each of the country�s nine provinces to tackle climate change impacts. The plans are expected to be ready by the mid-2020s, he said.He said Colombo needs to deal with a range of problems, from worsening flash flooding to a lack of clean water. �But tackling rising temperatures is one of the urgent ones,� he said.Dealing with rising temperatures will require making Colombo�s people more aware of measures to adapt, such as conserving water and constructing buildings with more ventilation, Jayathunga said.�But all this takes time,� he said.The World Bank�s Mani said governments in South Asia have been focused on natural disasters and finding ways to deal with them, which has left more gradual and less visual threats, such as temperature hikes, overlooked in some places.�Lots of the time countries pay attention to disasters like floods and drought and make policy changes, but they should also look seriously at these kinds of slow-moving shifts that are happening, that could be equally dangerous,� he said.��"
Global campaign to  test and treat Hepatitis Eliminating the disease is the immediate need of the hour,"2018-07-27 12:54:47							0						 				3976","�Hepatitis is one of those infections that people are less aware of. Unless tested, one wouldn�t detect this viral infection as its symptoms appear only in selected instances. Hence the global campaign launched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) aims to test and treat this infection before it spreads to the rest of the world population. Statistics reveal that around 325 million people around the world are living with viral Hepatitis while 290 million of them are unaware of�the symptoms.� �In view of World Hepatitis Day, which is annually celebrated on July 28, the Daily Mirror spoke to Dr. Lalindra Dias, Consultant Physician at the District General Hospital � Nuwara Eliya, who elaborated on the types of Hepatitis, symptoms, treatment and prevention.� ��Inflammation of the liver�Hepatitis is the inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis infections are prevalent among countries with a poor socio-economic status. As such Sri Lanka too is affected as a result of varieties of Hepatitis infections. Infections could be contracted by both males, females and children. The condition can be self-limiting or could progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver cancer.���Types�According to Dr. Dias there are both infectious and non-infectious causes of Hepatitis. �Infectious causes include Hepatitis A,B,C,D and E while there are various non-infectious causes,� he said. �Among the most common non-infectious causes is Nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) also known as Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver disease. Alcohol is another leading cause of non-infectious Hepatitis. Various medications such as paracetamol and anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief should be avoided. This also includes limiting the excessive usage of herbal preparations. Other causes included autoimmune diseases and genetic and familial causes,�the doctor added.��Infectious types��Among the infectious types of Hepatitis, Hepatitis A and E are most common,� Dr. Dias added. �These two types are mainly transmitted through faeco-oral transmissions. These transmissions occur when patients don�t have good toilet practices and due to lack of poor sanitation. In turn they touch food and water and the infection is carried on. This is a common infection during floods and among people who live in slums and close communities. However there are vaccinations to prevent the Hepatitis A infection. On the other hand Hepatitis B and C are transmitted through unprotected sexual practices with�unknown partners.�Another reason is due to sharing of intravenous needles among drug users and very rarely through emergency blood transfusions. But nowadays the transmission through blood and blood products is extremely rare due to widely available high-tech screening programmes. These two types could also be transmitted from an infected mother to a foetus,�he explained.� Speaking further Dr. Dias said that other infectious causes such as dengue fever and leptospirosis could also lead up to�Hepatitis infection.� ��Non-infectious types�As mentioned before, NASH is one of the common causes of non-infectious Hepatitis. �This is common among patients with diabetes, high cholesterol and those who are obese,� Dr. Dias continued. �In order to prevent NASH it is important to control diabetes and reduce weight. In addition to that, high intakes of alcohol could lead to Hepatitis infections and patients could end up having cirrhosis,�he affirmed.�How do you know that you are infected?Some of the acute features include the following :�	High fever	Body aches, lethargy and fatigue	Severe loss of appetite	Jaundice � discolouration of eyes and skin	Passage of dark-coloured urine� � � nSevere abdominal pain on the right side.� ��If one develops the above symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor,� Dr. Dias added. �Usually Hepatitis A and E improve without many complications. But Hepatitis B and C could lead to chronic Hepatitis and patients could ultimately end up with cirrhosis. It could sometimes also culminate in conditions such as liver�cancer.�he said.�Prevention and treatments�He further said that the Hepatitis infection could cause grave consequences such as cirrhosis, cancer and ultimately death. �Therefore it is important to prevent it to the best of your ability,� he continued. �This could be achieved through safe sexual practices, cutting down on excessive consumption of alcohol, not sharing intravenous drug needles, controlling diabetes and reducing weight. If you have the above symptoms, it is important that you seek medical attention. The doctor will do a couple of blood tests while testing liver enzymes and doing an ultrasound scan of the liver.� he said.�According to Dr. Dias, Hepatitis A and E require symptomatic management. �This includes controlling the temperature, keeping the patient hydrated and avoiding liver-toxic drugs. While at the hospital, the doctors will safeguard the patient from further liver damage. Hepatitis could also be cured through vaccinations; for example Hepatitis B is already included in the National Immunisation Schedule. It is also advisable to get the Hepatitis A vaccination before travelling to countries such as India and Africa,�he stressed.��Aftercare��Once a patient has recovered from a Hepatitis infection he or she should take precautions,� he added. �As such a patient shouldn�t take painkillers such as paracetamol, anti-inflammatory drugs and also avoid the excessive usage of�herbal medications.�Patients should also cut down on the excessive consumption of alcohol and recreational drugs. Those who have been infected with Hepatitis A and E should engage in good sanitary and hygienic practices so that the infection isn�t transmitted to others. If a child has contracted Hepatitis, it is advisable that he or she doesn�t attend school during this period. It is the same with adults and patients are advised to rest as much as possible. In order to prevent Hepatitis B and C there are anti-viral agents that could be administered to patients,�he said.��World Hepatitis Day 2018��According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) viral hepatitis B and C are major health challenges, affecting 325 million people globally. They are root causes of liver cancer and leads to 1.34 million deaths every year.� �Hepatitis B and C are chronic infections that may not show symptoms for a long period; sometimes years or decades. At least 60% of liver cancer cases are due to late testing and treatment of viral hepatitis B and C. Low coverage of testing and treatment is the most important gap to be addressed in order to achieve the global elimination goals by 2030.� �WHO will focus on the theme: �Test. Treat. Hepatitis� in view of World Hepatitis Day 2018. WHO organises events and activities with the aim to achieve the following objectives globally, in regions and in countries:� �	�To support scale-up of hepatitis prevention, testing, treatment and care services, with specific focus on promoting WHO testing and treatment recommendations;� �	�To showcase best practices and promote universal health coverage of hepatitis services;��	�To improve partnerships and funding in the fight against�viral hepatitis.� �"
Eliminating  stigma associated with Mental disorders,"2018-07-27 12:48:46							0						 				1842","�� A mental health issue is like any other medical issue, or is it? What would you do if you� have fever, or severe abdominal pain? The majority of us would not hesitate to seek medical help, if we think that it may be something serious. But are we honestly giving mental disorders the same attention that we give physical illnesses? Even though 1 in every 4 people worldwide is likely to suffer from a mental disorder, according to the WHO, many people are reluctant to seek help, due to the stigma associated with mental illnesses.�Today, on Health Capsule, we have consulted Dr. Udena Attigalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, in the hope of obtaining more information on mental health disorders, as education is an important component of removing the stigma associated with mental health issues.� ��It�s not all black and whiteMental health issues are a spectrum, varying from mild to severe, explains Dr. Attygalle. The spectrum for each category of mental health issue consists of various signs. Milder symptoms are named as �problems�, while moderate to severe symptoms are likely to be diagnosed as a �disorder�. For it to be diagnosed as a disorder it has to affect one�s life significantly, the doctor clarifies. Have you ever felt down, hopeless, losing interest in the things that you usually love, even for a short period of time? Then it�s likely that you have been placed in the spectrum of mental health issues; specifically that of depression, at some point in your life.� ��Common mental health issuesIf you take a random patient suffering from mental illnesses, you are more likely to get a person who is depressed, anxious or a child with a behavioral disorder, rather than a person who fits the image of what the society preconceives as�mental illness. This, according to the doctor, is because these are the most prevailing mental health issues in today�s society.� ��Physical illnesses vs mental illnessesIf you or one of your loved ones has ever suffered from a mental health issue, you may have heard advises like �Get over it, it�s all on your mind� and �You are not sick�. We ask the doctor, �Are these true? Is it all in our minds?�. Just as there are changes in your body�s chemical composition when you are physically ill, there are chemical as well as physiological changes associated with mental illnesses as well, he explains. But, since most of these changes occur in specific areas of the brain, which is an extremely complex organ, these changes are difficult to detect, he clarifies further.� �Take, for an example, Dengue fever and Severe Depression. While both have the capacity to cause much harm, even death and depression cannot be diagnosed or monitored through blood tests, unlike dengue fever. Some of these changes can be observed through advanced imaging like FMRI, but are difficult to use as diagnostic tools.� ��Underlying causesMost Mental Disorders have a strong genetic component associated with them. In simpler words, the risk of developing a mental illness is higher in people whose close relatives are having mental disorders, when compared to the general population. But mental illnesses have a strong association with environmental factors like stressful life events and bereavements as well. But how these affect a person varies from each individual. Out of two people living in the same kind of environment undergoing similar life stresses, only one may develop a mental health issue. It�s also affected by the social background of a person, especially the social support he receives. A child with absentee parents and no friends is at a more risk of developing a mental health disorder.� �Mental health issues have an association with the personality of the individual as well. A person who tends to look at the negative side of life and gets easily disheartened will be more susceptible to depression than a person with a more optimistic view of life.� �There is something called the Bio Psycho Social model, which is used to describe the aetiology of mental health disorders, explains the doctor. This demonstrates that mental disorders are a result of a combination of Biological, Genetic factors, Psychological and social factors rather than due to a single aetiology.� ��Negative effects due to stigmaStigma is mainly twofold; stigma that has a link with the public which may sometimes cause you to avoid a person showing signs of ill mental health, and self stigma, where a patient fears stigma from the society and avoids either social interactions or seeking medical attention.� �Generally, the help seeking behaviour is very poor in the society with regard to mental health. The stigma associated with mental ill health plays a major part in�this regard.�Patients and family members tend to ignore the symptoms until the patient is severely ill and needs to seek medical advice. The major disadvantage of this situation is that in most mental disorders, the potential for complete cure drastically reduces by delaying treatment.� �In addition, the quality of life of a patient with a diagnosed mental disorder is significantly lowered due to the wrong perceptions the society has of him or her. The prospect of finding employment reduces and the patient being isolated from the society leads to poor self esteem and depression. This may make his condition worse. The first thing that we need to understand when it comes to the stigma associated with mental disorders is that contrary to popular belief, the majority of the patients with mental disorders can be treated. They function well in the society just like you and I.� ��Eliminating stigmaWhat is our role in reducing the stigma associated with mental health? Accurate information and being educated about the condition is the main enemy of stigma, explains Dr. Attygalle. Knowing that the genetic and environmental causes as well as individual factors contribute in causing mental disorders, understanding that there is a wide spectrum of mental disorders is prevalent in the world and that many of them are treatable is a good initiation to understanding about mental disorders.� �Having positive experiences associated with mental health conditions is another way of reducing stigma. You may have a friend who has suffered from depression, but copes better than you and I when faced with a stressful situation. Understanding that they are humans who are simply suffering from an illness is also crucial.� �The role of the media associated with mental health is large, though sadly, more frequently than not, this opportunity is used to spread negative messages about mental ill health. Understanding how the media and entertainment industry reflect on mental disorders is not always accurate, that violence and aggression associated with mental disorders are exceptions, rather than the rule. This is vital towards eliminating stigma associated with mental health.� �One final message to our readers who are or who know someone who is suffering from a mental health issue: Even though it�s not visible outwardly, mental disorders can be equally painful as physical illnesses. Do not hesitate to seek help from a qualified psychiatrist, since as we highlighted previously in the article, the chance treatment being successful is high, in seeking medical care early.� � �"
Tragedy doctoring the Health Service What JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa proposes is to produce more doctors for the private sector at public expense,"2018-07-27 01:20:23							1						 				2443","JVP MP moves wants two more medical faculties, saying country has only 50 per cent of required doctors�In addition to Teaching Hospitals medical faculties need more resources and facilities to turn out quality productsAlready the existing medical faculties do not have the required full-time teachersNone of the successful campaigns against diseases had doctors involved-all were by PHIs and PHMs�Can more medical doctors reverse the continuing decline in our health service? JVP member in Parliament Dr Nalinda Jayatissa has moved two private member motions to establish medical faculties at the Uva Wellassa and Moratuwa Universities, with Badulla and Nagoda Hospitals proposed as �Teaching Hospitals�.� �His argument is that Sri Lanka has only 50 per cent of the required number of medical doctors and medical faculties in State Universities can only accommodate 1,200 to 1,300 medical undergraduates each year-therefore, the need to establish two more medical faculties to increase the number of student intake.� �There is something rather sneaky in his proposal to have Nagoda Hospital as the Teaching Hospital for the proposed Moratuwa Faculty. Why go that far when there are two other hospitals much closer in Panadura and Bandaragama?Besides that, though a medical doctor, the JVP politician fails to understand that to produce a �quality� medical professional, a Teaching Hospital is not the only necessity.� �A Medical Faculty needs many more resources and facilities to turn out quality professionals.� �Though the GMOA and Deans of Medical Faculties in State Universities cry foul over the SAITM Medical Faculty, they are selfishly silent on the quality of education in their own medical faculties including Rajarata, Ruhuna (Karapitiya) and Eastern University.� �Most faculties don�t have permanent qualified teaching staff and are wholly dependent on �visiting� professors and lecturers from elsewhere.� �The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), throttled by the GMOA mafia in decision making, has evaded this lapse and the necessity of having a permanent teaching staff in their draft on �minimum standards in medical education� by allowing medical professionals in Teaching Hospitals to be counted as teaching staff.� �This is one of the many reasons, the GMOA as a trade union, should be completely barred from running for positions in the SLMC and the reason, why the SLMC should be restructured anew to give it better representation from other professions and to �societal� interests.��The whole approach in shaping our health service with medical doctors and the argument that we need more medical doctors raises the vital question, �what we as a society expect from our health service?�� �Do we want more and more patients to seek outdoor and indoor treatment in hospitals for medical doctors and specialists to have a thriving private practice?� �Do we have to keep increasing the number of medical doctors to treat increasing numbers of patients? Is that what we are looking for?��The argument for more medical doctors, the JVP MP Dr Jayatissa is echoing, is one borrowed from his own ilk in the GMOA.� �If the existing number of medical doctors is 50 per cent of the required number, he should explain, why medical doctors are posted in numerous offices to attend to administrative work.� �On the Health Services, Minutes Gazetted in October 2014 that comes after the GMOA mafia endorses it, there are 324 administrative posts strictly for medical doctors.� �There are also 341 MOH positions for medical doctors. Lately, there are other stupidly unnecessary office positions created in the 25 RDHS offices with designations like MO-IT, MO - Planning and MO-Health Education, while in Colombo Hospitals, there are other posts that keep cropping up like MO-5S and MO-QC.��These office-based positions totalling around 800 don�t need medical graduates.� �While increasing numbers of medical doctors take over such idling administrative positions, the overall health service is on the decline.��The alarming spread of Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is one proof.� �The spread of dengue is mainly due to the callous disregard of the once very effective monitoring and regulating mechanism that was then under a Senior Public Health Inspector (PHI) but now controlled by medical doctors sitting in MOH Chairs.��With medical doctors in office as MOHs, not interested in enforcing monitoring proper and regulating, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence in most Provinces although the highest incidence of DF/DHF is seen in the Western Province (44.9% in 2007).� �In the recent past, the incidence of DF/DHF has been more marked in the NCP (4.8% in 2004 vs. 11.8% in 2007), Wayamba (10.2% in 2004 vs. 15.9% in 2007) and Sabaragamuwa (6% in 2004 vs. 12.2% in 2007) and with 35,008 cases reported in 2009 with 346 deaths, according to the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry.� �With all the rhetoric available from medical officers manning decision-making and implementing positions in the health sector, during the first three months of 2018, there were 14,627 reported cases of DF/DHF.� �The result is that we have hospitals with DF/DHF patients cramped everywhere in the hospitals.��In Sri Lanka, this needs to be stressed and emphasized with the GMOA mafia wanting to portray and project the medical profession as the sole saviour and guardian of our health services. It is a total and an absolute lie.� �It wasn�t medical doctors who worked towards lifting Sri Lanka�s health status to that of the more advanced countries.�From hookworm to poliomyelitis, from malaria to whooping cough, smallpox and filariasis, all outbreaks and recurrences were eradicated through a well monitored and regulated community based preventive healthcare service handled by paramedical servicemen and not by medical doctors.� �PHIs played a very vital role in carrying out an islandwide awareness on personal hygiene and developing cleaner sanitation. They were responsible for creating a new generation that paid more attention to personal cleanliness and better family hygiene. It was also PHIs and the Midwives who played a very committed role in making immunization and vaccination programmes a success in the 1960s.��In the 1980s with WHO support and guidance the anti-leprosy campaign was efficiently and successfully carried through to declare leprosy as eradicated in 1992, without medical doctors playing any significant role.� �Now that medical doctors have taken over leprosy prevention, there is once again a warning of a possible increase in leprosy cases.� �Yet, another interesting piece of news was from Moneragala, when the now hyped Gam Peraliya development programme was launched over a month ago.� �It was reported, 25,000 households were without proper toilets. A special allocation was set aside for their construction. Truth is, if the MOH was effectively monitoring and regulating community health in his or her area, this lack of toilets should have been remedied, long before Gam Peraliya was launched.� �This also raises the question why allocations for their construction were channelled through the Divisional Secretariat (DS) and not through the MOH.� �The fact is, MOH is now a wholly irrelevant position in community life even after the spread of dengue fever.� �MOH is not seen or heard of even in dengue prevention campaigns that are carried through Development Officers in DS offices, LG councillors and local area Police, at times backed by the STF as well.��Therefore what we should as a society demand from our health service is a very strong preventive community healthcare system to reduce numbers admitted to hospitals.� �A preventive healthcare system makes hospitals in the curative healthcare system less important. Sri Lanka�s proud status on health rankings was achieved on a comparatively very low budget that depended more on preventive health care and sanitation than on curative healthcare and medical doctors.��Preventive community health care with trained paramedics checking on households regularly is certainly not as expensive as curative health care with sophisticated hospitals, long lists of expensive medicinal drugs prescribed by medical doctors and specialists, supported by semi-professional staff like MLTs, Radiographers and Physiotherapists.� �Sri Lanka needs to give more importance to preventive community health care over curative healthcare that should have a strict referral system.��We are wasting money on curative health with heavy investments going in search of the most modern and expensive health equipment to meet ever-increasing numbers of patients.� �This is due to GMOA backed medical professionals holding all key positions in the health hierarchy who are not �pro-people� as they project themselves to be.� �We also need to break out of international norms and standards, where and when necessary to design programmes for our own need(s).� �We should get back to the well-knit preventive healthcare service with paramedics at the community level that we had till the 70s. This can be redesigned under specially trained senior PHIs designated as �Area Community Health Officers� (ACHO) to clear out this mess. The ACHOs should also have well trained �Public Health Midwives� (PHM) in the field.� �The present WHO norm of having one PHI for 10,000 persons and one PHM for 3,000 persons should be revised for a more practically valid ratio.��It is humanly impossible for a PHM to care for 3,000 pregnant mothers and infants within a month that includes home visits too.��So is it with PHIs. The present MOH who is a medical doctor can thus be repositioned as the GP in outpatient dispensaries in ACHO divisions.��A community based preventive healthcare system would help reduce the heavy cost of producing medical doctors through low-quality medical faculties proposed at public expense.� �Experience during past decades proves that increasing the numbers of medical doctors produced does not in any way improve the health of people.�They only get comfortably absorbed into the thriving private sector health industry that lacks full-time medical doctors.� �Thus, what JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa actually proposes is to produce more medical doctors in the private sector health industry at public expense.���The medical profession now only feels money, not human pain.��"
Leptospirosis : Be aware of severe rat fever!,"2018-07-12 00:00:02							0						 				2285","�	This bacteria is excreted when these mammals urinate and ends up in soil and water	�	The initial acute or septicaemic phase lasts about one week�Leptospirosis, commonly known as rat fever, is mainly a disease infecting people working outdoors. This is a disease that occasionally causes serious consequences and even death.�It�s a bacterial infection brought by animals. Though it�s called rat fever, the germ is carried by other mammals like cattle, pig, goats, dogs, raccoons and bats. This bacteria is excreted when these mammals urinate and ends up in soil and water. The germ can enter humans through abraded skin (scratches, wounds, eczema and shoe cuts or through intact mucous membrane/mouth, genitals)This disease is a biphasic illness. The initial acute or septicaemic phase lasts about one week. The second phase is an immune phase with circulating antibodies (IgM) accompanied by excretion of the bacteria in the urine.���Contest in Sri LankaLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease and one of the main communicable diseases in Sri Lanka. The disease is endemic in Sri Lanka with occasional outbreaks.Consultant Transfusion Physician Dr. Kumudini Gonsalkorale told the Daily Mirror that the farming community and those who spend much time with animals were susceptible to the disease in Sri Lanka.�In the rural areas, it�s the farmers and agricultural workers who are mostly affected. In the urban areas the disease often affects the slum dwellers,� Dr. Gonsalkorale said.�The situation in Sri Lanka is pathetic. The death of the breadwinner makes the whole family destitute. Their voices are never heard. The illness never receives prominence because it mainly affects the lower income group. A death of a poor farmer never affects others. It is only the kith and kin of these poor people who suffer,� Dr. Gonsalkorale affirmed.�In Sri Lanka, leptospirosis is reported throughout the year. Annually there are two peaks in the disease incidence; at the time of the monsoons, a smaller one during March -May and a larger one during October - December,� she added�Even with ICU care, 70% or more of those with lung haemorrages cause death. No definitive treatment is available for these patients with pulmonary haemmorrages Dr. Gonsalkorale�According to the Epidemiology Unit, there had been a significant increase in reporting and identifying leptospirosis cases over the past few decades since identification of the first confirmed leptospirosis case in 1953. In the year 2008 Sri Lanka reported the largest outbreak of leptospirosis with 7423 suspected cases and 204 deaths. Subsequently, 4980 cases and 145 deaths were reported in 2009 and in 2010 the number of cases was 4553 with 121 dying.The highly endemic areas are Colombo, Gampaha, Matale, Kurunegala and Kalutara which are known to be overcrowded with agricultural communities and changing weather and environmental factors.The factors affecting prevalence of the leptospirosis in Sri Lanka can�t be investigated in to. Seasonal analysis is needed in the wet and dry zones corresponding with the main Yala and Maha agricultural seasons. The annual rainfall is mainly associated with the prevalence of leptospirosis in the wet zone while the agricultural environment associated with the prevalence of leptospiros is in the dry zone.���The new procedure has been effective that it has reduced the number of deaths reported from the sever form of the rat fever Dr. Welivitiya�New procedures of control�Dr. Gonsalkorale said that the pulmonary haemorrages (bleeding into the lungs) which is the severe form of this disease had a very high mortality rate.This is also called �Weil�s disease� and it can develop after the acute phase as the second phase of the biphasic illness or can simply present as a single progressive illness. The outcome can become very severe.�Even with ICU care, 70% or more of those with lung haemorrages cause death. No definitive treatment is available for these patients with pulmonary haemmorrages,� Dr. Gonsalkorale said.�After considering the high percentage of deaths reported due to the cause of pulmonary haemmorrages, the National Blood Transfusion Service has commenced a procedure called Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) to control pulmonary haemorrages. This procedure was initiated by the Teaching Hospital of Karapitiya in 2016,� she said.�Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a treatment that removes plasma from the blood. The removed plasma is then replaced with a substitute. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. It helps carry blood cells and other substances throughout the body.Consultant Transfusion Physician of the Blood Bank Dr. Theshanthi Welivitiya said they had carried out plasma exchanges for more than 150 patients since 2016 with pulmonary haemorrhage and percentage of recovery was 70%.�The new procedure has been effective that it has reduced the number of deaths reported from the sever form of the rat fever,� Dr. Welivitiya said.�The only issue is that the Colombo South Teaching Hospital is an overcrowded hospital and once again accommodating patients in an ICU becomes a huge problem. The main problem faced is that this expensive machine used for the procedure has to be pushed from place to place in order to treat these patients,� Dr. Welivitiya added.�Symptoms� �Leptospirosis may present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. It may also mimic many other diseases such as dengue fever, influenza, meningitis, and hepatitis. Jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin) is a relatively common symptom in leptospirosis, but is also found in many other diseases involving the liver. However, following symptoms are common when it comes to leptospirosis.� ��Preventive measures� �The disease can be prevented to some extent by taking precautionary measures, yet many folks are unaware of the disease or the preventive methods. If you are involved in occupations such as farming, mining, cleaning drains and canals etc. please be alert. The following specific measures can help to prevent leptospirosis.� ��	Removal of rubbish and keeping areas around human habitation clean.� �	�	Keep animals away from gardens, playgrounds, sandboxes, and other places where children play.� �	�	Appropriate, protective clothing, knee-high boots, gloves etc should be worn and wounds should be covered with waterproof dressing� 	�	Use boiled water for drinking (chlorination is seldom useful, as virulent organisms withstand up to 4 Parts per million (ppm); filtered water is also not safe)� �	�	Avoid walking in flood water� �	�	Use the medicine called Doxycyclin which is distributed free by the health ministry to be taken as a preventive drug.� ��"

Hairless by hair loss,"2018-06-22 10:54:32							0						 				4418","�Everyone dreams of being proud owners to thick, luscious and voluminous hair. However hair loss stands in the way of making that dream a reality. Hair loss isn�t merely just fall of hair in excessive amounts. There may be medical complications involved that lead to loss of hair in chunks. When this happens alarm bells should ring in the mind and indicate that it�s high time to seek medical advice. Dr. Nayani Madarasingha,� Consultant Dermatologist, speaks to Health Capsule this week about hair loss, its causes and cure.���When to worry�More than a thousand hairs reside on a healthy scalp. Each hair undergoes a growth cycle. �This cycle consists of 3 phases. The first phase is the growth phase where hairs undergo growth and this may extend to a time frame of a few years. This phase varies according to each individual,� explained Dr. Madarasingha. This is why the length and volume of hair differ from person to person.� ��Secondly, the hair enters the catagen phase. Here the hair ceases its active growth and the connection of the hair fibres to the roots is lost. The final phase is the telogen phase which is the resting phase of the hair. This lasts for 3 months and this phase is common to people.� �After each hair strand completes its life cycle, it will fall off after 3 months of the resting phase. A new hair strand will grow in its place from the hair follicle,� she continued.� �According to the Dermatologist, an individual tends to lose 50-100 strands a day which is actually quite normal. So this kind of hair loss is no cause for alarm. However there are cases where hair is shed abnormally and the hair volume starts getting affected by the loss of hair. When this happens it is high time to receive treatment and prevent further�hair loss.� �Root causes�Excessive hair shedding and hair thinning are the two reasons that take the blame for abnormal loss of hair.� �There are several factors that lead to excessive hair shedding. �Firstly, it could occur as an acute phenomenon after a stressful event such as pregnancy, surgery, dengue, etc. At the end of the resting phase, hair strands should shed for the new ones to surface. However this circumstance causes an individual to lose even up to 90% of hair. On a more positive note, the lost hair can be replaced with new ones in another 3 months.� �Drugs prescribed for certain diseases especially those taken to treat cancer affect the growth of hair and leads to an arrest in the growth of the hair strands, causing them to fall off. Other drugs taken for conditions such as cholesterol too lead to excessive shedding.� �Hormonal imbalances and thyroxin deficiency in particular can cause abnormal hair loss. Diet issues, iron and vitamin deficiencies too lead to problems associated with hair loss. Certain medical illnesses may cause excessive hair loss as well,� stated Dr. Madarasingha.� �Hair loss due to hair thinning, informally known as the balding process, is mainly hereditary and caused by genetics. �This type of hair loss is also referred to as �pattern hair loss� as hair is lost gradually. This is seen in both males and females. In women, pattern hair loss may not always be caused due to genetics. Hormonal imbalances and complications such acne, polycystic ovarion syndrome can lead to pattern hair loss,� she accentuated.� ��Diagnosis�If treatment is started early, this progression can be prevented and slowed down. �People tend to treat these conditions themselves and think that oil massages, etc will help recover the lost hair. However hair loss has become an issue that requires medical attention as it may be caused due to various medical reasons as mentioned above. It�s very important to identify the cause for hair loss suffered by an individual,� she advised.� �There are various diagnostic methods available to target� the type of cause responsible for hair loss in a person. �An analytical examination is the most basic form of diagnosis where a thorough examination is conducted on the patient, also inspecting the patient�s family history on diseases and hair loss as well. There are special instruments that are used in the diagnosis too. Biopsies may be conducted, but this is a diagnostic method that is very rarely resorted to. Hair loss due to certain hormones and vitamin deficiencies can be identified simply by a blood test,� Dr. Madarasingha informed.� ��Treatment available���Many methods of treatment for abnormal hair loss are available and they are said to be safe and successful. Treatment is based on the diagnosis of the cause for hair fall. Topical applications on the scalp and oral tablets that should be continued on a long-term basis are common methods of treatment. �If a patient suffers from an advanced case of� hair loss, the common methods may not prove to be 100% effective. In such cases, the answer would be hair transplants,� she said.� �A technique known as PRP ( Platelet Rich Plasma) is currently being used in hair loss treatment where a small amount of the patient�s own blood is extracted and the platelets in the blood are isolated and then injected to the scalp of the patient. �Blood platelets contain a component known as growth factor which will allow hair to grow back. This procedure too is said to be a safe and reliable one with positive results,� the Dermatologist assured.� ��Not just a female problem!�According to the Dr. Madarasingha, conditions like pattern hair loss is not just restricted to individuals above 40 years of age or older. Sometimes people in their early twenties and even younger are susceptible to these complications. It�s often thought that hair loss is a complication that affects females only. However this is not true. Hair loss is impartial to both males and females alike. Females are simply worried about hair loss than males and tend to take action unlike them!��"

The end result is the general public is inconvenienced but no one cares!!!Huge empty water tanks are left at random on the roads; near the parks, no one knows the purpose they serve, more importantly, no one cares!!!

�  PM is the  best bet as UNP�s  Presidential Candidate  �,"2018-06-05 00:48:15							11						 				6354","Tourism Promotion Minister John Amaratunga during an interview with the� spoke about the political situation of the country and the reforms of the United National Party (UNP) which he represents. Excerpts:� ���Q �What is your analysis of the current status of the Government?There is no difference. The national Unity Government will continue. The Ministers representing Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in the Government are also doing their normal work. In fact, new subjects have been assigned to the ministers now.� ��Q� In the assignment of subjects, some institutions, such as the Department of Archaeology which was held by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, have been entrusted with Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. Why is that?I don�t know. I am yet to see the gazette notification. I cannot comment on it as a result. There is no change in the subjects I held as the Tourism Development Minister.� ��Q� As an UNPer with 40-years of experience how do you view the current status of the party?Had the UNP obtained an absolute majority there would have been no problem. We would have forged ahead with our own policies. Since we had to join hands with the SLFP to form the Government, there were differences. Nevertheless, we�re working together.� ��As a result of FCID operations, we have been able to minimize corrupt practices�Q� How do you compare and contrast the UNP�s present situation with its past?During the regime of J. R. Jayewardene as the President, we had five-sixth majority. We could implement anything we wanted. Today, the UNP is only a part of the Government.� ��Q� How do you view the differences in terms of policies?�There is one difference here. We could implement projects speedily during the past. That is because of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). Officials fear making decisions because of the FCID�s operations. They think twice before implementing a decision.� �There are two aspects here. That is to mitigate corruption. As a result of FCID operations, we have been able to minimize corrupt practices. Everyone is careful to make sure that financial regulations are upheld. That, however, causes delays in implementing projects.���Q� Did you experience this personally in your ministry?Yes. We have to implement the digital advertising programme regarding the promotion of tourism. Officials fear bypassing the procedures. They insist on following the procedures. It has delayed the implementation of the programme, hence affecting tourism.� ��Q� What�s the UNP planning to do in view of the Presidential Elections?�The Working Committee will decide who should be our candidate. Two Ministers have already said that UNP Leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should be the candidate. If the Working Committee decides, we will go ahead with it. Minister Mangala Samaraweera clearly said the Prime Minister would be the candidate. If he says that, it may be the final decision.� ��Q� What is your opinion?I think the Prime Minister stands a good chance of emerging as the winner at the elections.� ��Q� You see him as the best bet?Yes, at the moment, he is the best bet. That is because of the enormous experience he has regarding governance and foreign and economic affairs. In early 1970s, people used to talk about J.R. Jayewardene as a hopeless candidate. He was viewed as an arrogant person. Yet, he proved to be the best candidate for the UNP.� ��The Mahinda Rajapaksa group is also very strong. When the anti-UNP vote base is divided between them, we can emerge victorious��Q� There is a cry from the UNP backbenchers that young blood should be infused to the UNP hierarchy. What is your opinion?I�m not against that view. They should be given more responsibilities. They must understand one thing. I will cite one example. After I enetered Parliament, I remained without a portfolio for 10 years. I was just an MP. I continued to wait. Later, I was appointed as the State Minister of Finance. Since then, I have been getting portfolios. One shouldn�t expect ministerial posts immediately after entering Parliament.� ��Q� If the party must groom another leader, who do you have in mind?There are enough and more at the second level of the party. Ministers Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake are there. We also have Ministers Harin Fernando and Mangala Samaraweera. There are five or six people identified as potential future leaders. As time progresses, we will find a person to fill the vacuum.� ��Q� What are the policy changes you expect in the party?The UNP has the same kind of policies. They cannot be changed. We are a democratic party and believe in the private sector as the engine of growth.� ��Q� How do you view the chemistry between the President and the Prime Minister?They are on talking terms though some people may think otherwise. I do not see any difference of opinion between them. The Unity Government will continue operating during the remaining 18 months.� ��Q� As far as the UNP reforms are concerned, what do you think of the recent appointment of new office bearers to key posts such as the General Secretary?I think those changes are enough. There is no need to make any drastic changes to continue for the next 18 months. Drastic changes can be made after the next elections.� ��Q� How hopeful are you of winning the next elections?The SLFP group led by President Maithripala Sirisena is also strong. The Mahinda Rajapaksa group is also very strong. When the anti-UNP vote base is divided between them, we can emerge victorious.� ��Q� You had similar hopes during the Local Government Elections held on February 10 because the President and the former President did not unite. But the UNP couldn�t win . Why is it?That is true. There were various views expressed in this regard. We did not get the expected results.� ��These foreign nationals, who were assaulted, did not come to give evidence. They made a hue and cry, and left. We couldn�t punish wrongdoers as a result�Q� What do you think of UNP Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake being denied a ministerial post despite making requests?Mr. Karunanayake played a major role in the installation of this Government in 2015. He worked very hard for it. There were allegations against him regarding the alleged Bond Scam. According to the report, he hasn�t been involved in any scam. There is no reason for him to be deprived of a ministerial post. He hasn�t been found guilty.� ��Q� How is the growth within the tourism sector?In 2010, there were only 400,000 tourists. Now, we get 2.5 million arrivals. Every month the number is increasing. At the same time, there are obstacles in our way. There was the closure of the airport and dengue epidemic. We have heard of a few incidents where tourists were assaulted. They have hampered the development of tourism.� ��Q� Some ambassadors raised this matter with you. What did they discuss?They sent travel advisories. When the Dutch tourists were attacked, they sent travel advisories. These foreign nationals, who were assaulted, did not come to give evidence. They made a hue and cry, and left. We couldn�t punish wrongdoers as a result.� �We have to get our digital campaign right to promote tourism. We have to ensure the safety of tourists. We are trying to develop the domestic airports. We have to expand our international airport. We need to increase the number of immigration officers. We have to develop the railway system. Many tourists are willing to travel by train.� �There are many airlines willing to land here. Our landing and parking charges are very high. We have to bring them down.� ��Q� The recent tax hike has affected tourist industry. Foreign nationals have complained about high charges for food and accommodation due to increased taxes. How do you see this?We have received complaints both from locals and foreigners about it. In general, people find it difficult to live. When the rupee value depreciates, the rupee component of foreign exchange earnings increases. That is a plus point. Foreigners get the benefit from this.� ����"
Trump�s blockade is to  provoke regime change � Cuban Ambassador,"2018-06-04 00:03:46							0						 				2393","Cuba�s National Assembly elected Miguel Diaz-Canel as the country�s President in April. Diaz-Canel followed Raul Castro who served two consecutive terms from 2008 when the health of his brother Fidel was in decline. Fidel Castro, who led the 1959 revolution that overthrew Fulgencio Batista�s dictatorship and ruled the country since died in 2016. The Daily Mirror talked to Cuba�s Ambassador in Colombo, Elena Ramos Rodriguez, on what may be expected from the new leader from a post-revolution generation, US President Donald Trump�s hardened policy towards Cuba, its effects on the Cuban people and Cuba�s response to the intensified economic blockade imposed by the US government.� �Excerpts:� �Elena Ramos Rodriguez�Cuba�s new President Miguel Diaz-Canel was born a year after the 1959 revolution, representing a relatively younger generation of politicians. Does this generational shift point to a change in Cuba�s style of government in years ahead?I want to highlight the significance of the last session of the Cuban parliament, on April 18-19 when Mario Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez was elected the new President of the Council of State and President of the Council of Ministers. I think the new leader will continue the revolutionary process, will continue the development of our country, the development of our Socialism. Cuban people express their support for this electoral process. The people elect the members of Parliament, the Parliament elects the Council of State, and the Council of State elects the president. This process comes with the support of the people because a majority - 85.65% attended the polls to elect their representation in parliament, from each municipality. Voting is voluntary � if you vote it means you support (the process).� �Diaz-Canel�s predecessor Raul Castro had started introducing certain changes- reducing the size of the state sector, encouraging more private enterprise, loosening some controls etc. with benefit to the economy. Will the new President continue on this trajectory?Yes. The Cuban government and people are all working on updating the Cuban economic model. It is a complex process. It�s changing not because of pressure from outside but for Cuban society, to establish the economic and social guidance. It is a broad process, with many meetings with people in their workplaces, residential places etc. In Cuba, the programme does not change with each president. The guidelines are adopted with the opinion of all the population � in different ways they participate in the process.� ��""The Parliament elects the Council of State, and the Council of State elects the president. This process comes with the support of the people because a majority - 85.65% attended the polls to elect their representation in parliament, from each municipality� ""Former US President Barack Obama had started a process of normalization of Cuba-US relations, signalled by re-opening diplomatic missions in the two countries. Under Trump, this process is being reversed, and the economic blockade is being intensified. What will Cuba�s strategy be, to cope with this situation?I think Obama�s years demonstrated that Cuba and the US can live and co-exist in a civilized way. Interactions between both sides show that Cuba and the US can exist, respecting our differences and cooperating, for the benefit of both countries and peoples, at the same time. Wherever there is an opportunity, we can cooperate.� �Opportunity such as �?To stop drug trafficking, terrorism, illegal immigration. Intelligence is not the interest of one country � it�s for both countries. We share maritime borders. We have to cooperate for example in maritime rescue, to save people. Or to avoid contamination of our maritime waters. Cuba wants to continue negotiating with the US government, but on conditions of equality and respect for our sovereignty. Cuba will not resign any of its principles. Principles are non-negotiable.� �But the fact is that you have a US President whose attitude is belligerent. How will you face this situation?We have to face the new measures. In November last year the US Departments of State, Treasury and Commerce issued new provisions and regulations to implement and strengthen the blockade against Cuba - a week after the Nov. 1stvote in the UN General Assembly on the necessity to lift the blockade. These measures were in a new executive order of the President called �National Security Presidential Memorandum on Strengthening the Policy of the US towards Cuba.� They restrict travel of American citizens to Cuba, restrict commerce between the two countries. During Obama�s time it was more flexible on some issues, but the blockade was still there, especially in the financial/ banking sector.� �In 2016 the US abstention (during the UN vote on lifting the blockade) was a hopeful moment. These measures confirm the regress of bilateral relations as a result of the decisions of the government of Donald Trump. It is also important to say, these measures ignore US public opinion of about 75% which is a great majority, and the international community, and of the Cuban immigrants in the US. The majority of Cuban immigrants want normal relations. Only a small group in Florida want to continue the blockade. This transformation ignores the majority of the international community. On Nov. 1st 2017 for the 26th consecutive occasion, the resolution on �The necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the USA on Cuba� was approved by the General Assembly of the UN, with 191 votes in favour and two against: the US and Israel, confirming once again the absolute international rejection of this policy. Cuba will continue to present the resolution as long as the embargo is in place. Unfortunately the resolution is not binding. But it�s a good step to demonstrate that the international community supports Cuba.� ��""MediCuba, the company that imports and exports medical products, received a communication from the supplier Lindmed Trade of Spain, saying it could not supply the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin Lactate because the manufacturer Claris Otsuka refused to sell the goods because Cuba was subject to sanctions imposed by the US""The UN Secretary General in July last year presented a report, at the request of the members of the General Assembly, on the implementation of this resolution. Cuba said �the accumulated losses caused by the embargo during nearly six decades it has been in place amount to US$ 822 billion.� Can you give an example of how this translates into deprivation in the day to day lives of the Cuban people?The blockade affects all fields � business, health, education, agriculture. To give an example � in March 2017, MediCuba, the company that imports and exports medical products, received a communication from the supplier Lindmed Trade of Spain, saying it could not supply the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin Lactate because the manufacturer Claris Otsuka refused to sell the goods because Cuba was subject to sanctions imposed by the US.� �Ciprofloxacin Lactate is a broad spectrum antibiotic used for adults and children in the treatment of respiratory ailments. Also for skin, soft tissue, bones and joints affected by bacteria. This is an antibiotic used in all hospitals. This affects the health of our people not because the government doesn�t give the resources but because we cannot buy from the supplier.� �		I think the new leader will continue the revolutionary process, will continue the development of our country, the development of our Socialism			The ending of the embargo was approved by the the UN, with 191 votes in favour and two againsT			Cuba produces nickel. The company was unable to export 3,500 tons of it, produced in 2016 because they could not find a bank... 			The blockade is the main obstacle to the development of our country. 			The US wants to provoke a change of regime, by provoking anger of the people through shortages, by depriving them of food, medication.�� 			Cuba appreciates support provided by Sri Lanka in its fight against the US embargo			Our policy is to give what we have. Others give what they don�t use. Fifty-five per cent of state resources is allocated for budgeted activity 	Could you briefly explain the extra-territorial aspect of the embargo, how third parties � other states - are punished for having transactions with Cuba? An example?The case I just mentioned is also a good example of the extra-territorial impact. The supplier, the Spanish company cannot trade with Cuba. They too are affected. Legally they should be able to trade with Cuba. Also, many other companies have been sanctioned, fined, for doing business with Cuba.� �To give another example, Cuba produces nickel. The company was unable to export 3,500 tons of nickel sulphide produced in 2016 because they could not find a bank that would open a Letter of Credit. The loss to the Cuban economy was $23,600,000.� �In June 2016 the Netherlands mail and parcels company TNT returned to the Consulate General of Cuba in Madrid, two postal consignments addressed to the embassies of Cuba in China and Indonesia containing passports of Cubans living abroad. The company claimed that it had returned the consignments owing to corporate instructions related to the US embargo.� �The rest of the world supports Cuba on the need to end the embargo, which is in violation of the UN Charter and international law. Can you explain briefly, what is the problem the US has with Cuba?The blockade is the main obstacle to the development of our country. The US wants to provoke a change of regime, by provoking anger of the people through shortages, by depriving them of food, medication etc. They want a regime change favourable to the US. It didn�t happen because the Cuban people stayed brave. This policy satisfies only the interests of a small minority of the American and Cuban-American extreme right-wing of South Florida, whose interest is to reverse the process of normalization of bilateral relations. It is a violation of human rights in general. We have a good economy but it would be better if we didn�t have the blockade. Tourism is greatly affected. People like to visit Cuba, last year we had four million visitors. Imagine if there was no blockade! American citizens are not allowed to travel to Cuba as tourists, it�s prohibited. They need a special licence from the Treasury.� ��""I think Obama�s years demonstrated that Cuba and the US can live and co-exist in a civilized way. Interactions between both sides show that Cuba and the US can exist, respecting our differences and cooperating, for the benefit of both countries and peoples, at the same time. Wherever there is an opportunity, we can cooperate""Cuba sends its professionals like goodwill ambassadors to all parts of the world � doctors, teachers, artists, agriculture experts - demonstrating the high level of culture and education it has achieved for its people, in spite of the problems caused by its big neighbour. What is the secret of this achievement?Our policy is �internationalist.� One of the main principles in our relations with other countries is that we share what we have. If we can provide doctors, we do that. Our policy is to give what we have. Others give what they don�t use. Fifty-five per cent of state resources is allocated for budgeted activity such as education, public health, social security, pensions. That�s why there is a high standard. We believe you must support everybody. You cannot have homeless people. A mother who cannot work because her child has a disability will be provided with a government pension. It is a policy that demonstrates that even a poor nation that has not too many resources - if it uses resources for the welfare of the people - can grow its human capital, and improve living standards of the people, despite major challenges it faces. This is, maybe, our �secret!�� �Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba after the revolution and (in the words of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his condolence message on the death of Fidel Castro) �Cuba has been a great friend Sri Lanka could count on.� How can the Cuba-Sri Lanka relationship be taken forward?A. Sri Lanka and Cuba have historic bonds of friendship and cooperation. Sri Lanka established diplomatic relations in 1959 after the triumph of the revolution, at the very beginning. The first step was the visit of Che Guevara to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka and Cuba both entered the Non Aligned Movement (NAM) in the same year, 1961. Cuba received the presidency of NAM from Sri Lanka in 1979. We have a long history of cooperation in sports, education, health, agriculture. At this moment we are working on areas of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. In June, a delegation from Sri Lanka visited Cuba to follow up on implementation of an MoU between the ministries of Science and Technology of the two countries. Last year a Cuban expert visited Sri Lanka to share expertise on the control of dengue. We are also working on registering in Sri Lanka a Cuban product for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. It has an efficiency of over 80%, many people have saved their legs, avoiding amputation. Cuba sincerely appreciates the support provided by Sri Lanka in its fight against the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba for almost 60 years. On Nov. 1, once again Sri Lanka voted in favour of the Cuban revolution against the blockade in the General Assembly of the United Nations.��"

But perhaps there is an even better option - prevention.� �Dr. Joseph Mercola who publishes popular newsletters worldwide on health and well-being refers to the power to prevent viral illnesses by using the famous Ayurvedic herb � �holy basil� or thulasi in Tamil and maduruthala in Sinhala, that is also revered by Hindus.� �It is a common herb that grows all over Sri Lanka and therefore is readily available and easily administered � just by eating the raw leaves in a salad or sambol. About five leaves by adults and three by children under 12It is a common herb that grows all over Sri Lanka and therefore is readily available and easily administered � just by eating the raw leaves in a salad or sambol. About five leaves by adults and three by children under 12. Many who know the value of it say it works because they eat these leaves often and have not had a serious viral flu attack for�several years.� �This herb�s stimulating powers have been recognized by ancient healers and sages. In India people venerate thulasi or holy basil as a sacred plant. It is a part of Indian households, typically grown in earthen pots in the family home or garden.� �One of the most important reasons why it is so famous, aside from the fragrant flavour as a basil type cooking herb, is that it is one of the most effective adaptogens--an agent that helps our bodies adapt more effectively to stress caused by diseases.� �But thulasi also has another beneficial side effect, and that is helping to prevent and treat viral diseases such as Influenza, Dengue, Chikengunya, Swine Flu and Bird Flu.� �According to Dr. Mercola�s article thulasi or holy basil may improve your body�s overall defence mechanisms, including its ability to fight viral diseases. It helps speed up your recovery process if you suffer from illnesses such as swine flu or Dengue. It also strengthens your immune system.� �These benefits may stem from thulasi�s highly complex chemistry. It contains beneficial compounds called phyto-chemicals -- naturally occurring compounds that plants produce to protect themselves against bacteria, viruses and fungi -- that interact and have strong antioxidant, anti-viral, anti-bacterial and immune-enhancing properties. They promote general health and maintain your body�s natural defence against viruses, stress and disease.��If you are concerned about the Influenza, Dengue or any other viral disease Dr. Mercola highly recommends trying thulasi instead of the flu drugs�or vaccines.� �Many broad-minded medical analysts have recommended that Sri Lanka instead of depending so much on western medicine and medications should also give a place to time-tested medical systems such as Ayurveda, Homoeopathy and Acupuncture. Unfortunately western medicine, with the marvels of modern technology has today become a big business with many investors throwing their investments into private hospitals.� � �"
Diving deep into the influenza outbreak,"2018-05-31 00:00:01							0						 				1440","After the Dengue fiasco last year, the Seasonal Influenza Virus has taken centre stage as the most recent health scare. The disease is said to be spread mostly in the southern region of the country, claiming several lives including those of several young children. With not much information available on the present status of the disease, speculation is high, blowing the situation out of proportion. The Daily Mirror spoke to several individuals who are directly involved in dealing with the situation at different levels, clearing the air about these speculations and obtaining information on how to prevent the further spread of the disease.�Health authorities are making a rough assumption that the disease came with the touristsHospitals and ICU�s overflowing with patients�It�s reported that there have been 19 deaths so far of small children due to fever during the last 28 days, and 12 deaths from pneumonia in the Matara District General Hospital alone. Inside sources claim that the hospitals in Matara District are overflowing with patients having fever, and the bulk of the patients are being cared for at the Matara District General Hospital, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Kamburupitiya Hospital, Walasmulla Hospital, Tangalle hospital, Balapitiya Hospital and Elpitiya Hospital.� �ICUs in the district are overflowing with patients having fever and this includes the ICU�s in the hospitals in private sector as well, according to the sources. Out of the 4 people deceased, on the 28 May at the Matara Hospital, 3 are due to respiratory causes. Three people including a 21-year-old youth have passed away due to pneumonia on 28 alone, at the Matara General Hospital.� �On inquiring about the disease control measures taken it was initially reported that the schools of 8 divisions in Matara as well as all the pre-schools will be closed until June 1. Two epidemiology teams have been dispatched to the area to investigate the outbreak, according to the sources from the Health Ministry. Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal De Silva has requested an urgent report on the outbreak from the Regional Director of Health Services.� �Daily admissions to the hospital for other disease conditions have drastically reduced. Patients don�t show up at the clinics nor do they present themselves for routine pre-scheduled surgery out of fear for the disease outbreak� he revealedThe silence maintained by the Government and the health ministry regarding this matter has become a source of frustration to the general public. The difficulty in obtaining correct information regarding the disease and the number of affected people has driven undue fear and panic into the residents.��All major surgeries in Karapitiya Teaching Hospital have been suspended due to the fever situation�Dr. Janath Liyanage GMOA Branch President at the Karapitiya Hospital� Almost all our ICU beds are currently being occupied by patients having fever,� stated Dr. Janath Liyanage, Consultant Paediatric Surgeon and GMOA Branch President at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital (KTH) when asked to reveal the current situation at the hospital. Explaining further, he claimed that the ICU has been full for about two months now. All the major surgeries have been suspended until further notice, because the hospital cannot supply the required aftercare in the ICU for the patients undergoing these surgeries due to the ICU being overcrowded with patients having fever. �As a paediatric surgeon, I haven�t been able to do any major surgery for the past 2 months because of the unavailability of the ICU�s�, proclaimed Dr. Liyanage.� �As for the overall situation in the southern province, he stated that even the doctors weren�t aware of the exact situation, due to the patients being sent to hospitals throughout the province.� ��Not educating the public about the disease adequately has resulted in causing panic among the general population and there is the assumption that a deadly unknown germ is spreading in the Southern Province. Daily admissions to the hospital for other disease conditions have drastically reduced. Patients don�t show up at the clinics nor do they present themselves for routine pre-scheduled surgery out of fear for the disease outbreak� he revealed.� �When inquiring into the source of the disease and the strain of the virus he explained that the influenza epidemic commenced last November in US, causing almost 4000 deaths. �In Sri Lanka, as far as we know, the disease started somewhere around Weligama area, so we can make a rough assumption that it came with the tourists,� he said.� ��Like the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009 worldwide, it�s currently the influenza strain called H3N2 that is going around, though in a much smaller level, according to international data. So we are assuming that it�s the same strain that we are currently experiencing�, stated Dr. Liyanage.� �He emphasized that up to now, the Epidemiology Unit in Sri Lanka has failed to release any information on the virus strain or the specification of treatment to the healthcare workers. �Usually, an infectious disease like this is treated according to a national guideline prepared and released by the Epidemiology Unit. When we requested for an updated guideline they asked us to follow the guideline which was released in 2015�, he said.� ��GMOA is having a meeting with the minister to talk about expanding the ICU facilities. We have only 7 ICU beds, even though we have the space adequate for 6 more beds. We requested for the instruments last year, but so far they have not been given. So we are trying to add at least two or three additional beds and equipment to the ICU, to keep the hospital at a functional level,�he said.� Dr. Liyanage also stressed that the secondary infections are more dangerous than the Influenza itself. Most of the children presenting with fever, cough and cold improve within 3 to 4 days. Even though other symptoms disappear the cough can persist. They may again develop high fever with respiratory difficulties and cough, due to another germ that entered the system, due to the weakened tissues from influenza. These infections can be dangerous, causing respiratory failure and sometimes even death.�Influenza not only limited to Southern Province�Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama Infectious Diseases Hospital, Angoda�When asked if there is a risk of the virus spreading to the other regions, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, Consultant Physician at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Angoda revealed that contrary to the popular belief, the disease currently persists in other areas of the country, though at a lesser level. He stated that the IDH has been receiving influenza patients for the past 1 1/2 months, currently having around 5-6 admissions of suspected influenza patients per day.� The condition of the majority of these patients is not in serious and they are treated outside,� he further claimed.� �When inquiring into the specific strain of the virus he explained that the samples have been sent abroad to be analyzed. This is because Sri Lanka doesn�t have the facilities to analyze the virus and it might take some time for the results to arrive. �The strain of the virus isn�t important in treating the disease, because the treatment methods are similar between the strains of influenza�, he reassured.� �The Daily Mirror further learned from him that the vaccine for influenza is recommended to a limited number of people who exposed to risk, even in countries like UK; where they experience yearly outbreaks of influenza virus. These groups �at risk� include youngsters, the elderly, those who are suffering from chronic illnesses and healthcare workers. Therefore the vaccine isn�t required for each and every person and is better to be taken if recommended by a medical profession, he advised.� ��The vaccine, which is currently available only in the private sector, is not hundred percent effective due to the rapidly changing nature of the virus, he further claimed.� �Department of Health and Department of Education along with private and public media organizations have a big role to play in preventing the spread of influenza, stressed Dr. Wijewckrama.� ��Patients don�t show up at the clinics nor do they present themselves for routine pre-scheduled surgery out of fear for the disease outbreakWhen asked if there is a change in the severity of the disease compared to the previous years, Dr. Wijewickrama claimed that he didn�t observe a drastic change as such, since there were similar incidences of severe influenza during the past couple of years, resulting in pneumonia and sometimes causing deaths of people in vulnerable groups.� �The cause for the deaths associated with Influenza is mostly due to the delay in seeking medical care, he commented, explaining that sometimes patients wait until they have severe illness and respiratory difficulty to seek medical help. He added that sometimes the primary care doctors themselves fail to recognize that the patient needs hospitalized care. Dr. Wijewickrama also underscored that the main cause for the high morbidity in most patients with Influenza isn�t the influenza virus itself, but the secondary infections caused by bacteria. Most of this bacteria, which becomes deadly does not respond to antibiotics and it all relates again due to the ignorance of the patients, he declared. �Whenever a person develops a cough and cold, and even if it�s a viral illness, patients expect antibiotics to be prescribed. They demand antibiotics from the doctor or sometimes self-medicate themselves after obtaining medicine from pharmacies. Even some doctors are responsible for prescribing antibiotics inappropriately. So with the frequent use of antibiotics, the body becomes resistant to them and curing these bacterial infections becomes very difficult�, explained Dr. Wijewickrama, who strictly advised patients and the doctors not to use antibiotics unless the disease is of bacterial origin.� �Numerous attempts made by the Daily Mirror to contact the Epidemiology unit to obtain the confirmed statistics and information on the disease spread proved futile.��Prevention and seeking medical attentionDr. Ganganath Gunathilake Consultant in Paediatric Respirtory MedicineAccording to Dr. Ganganath Gunathilake, Consultant in Paediatric Respirtory Medicine, educating people regarding prevention is crucial in minimizing the spread of the disease. Being aware and maintaining a good respiratory hygiene can go a long way towards controlling the spread of the disease.� �Influenza is highly infectious within the first 7 days after symptoms develop. In preventing the spread of droplets, it�s important to remember that a cough can carry droplets a distance of roughly three feet. Therefore, if you are having symptoms like cough, fever and runny nose then it is important to wear a face mask and avoid public places where you can spread the disease to others. Small children having flu symptoms should be kept at home until the symptoms subside.� �All those who come in contact with the virus do not develop symptoms, explained the doctor. The majority would have no symptoms at all while the others would develop symptom ranging from a mild disease to pneumonia. Those who are at the extremes of age, Children under 2 years of age and elderly over 65 years of age, are more likely to develop a� severe illness. Among these children, those having chronic diseases or diseases in organs like the heart or the kidneys are more susceptible. Pregnant women as well as adults, who are suffering from chronic illnesses and having weakened immune systems, are also more vulnerable. If a person belongs to the above categories, it�s important to seek medical attention as soon as the symptoms appear, cautioned Dr. Gunathilake. Patients who are having high fever or respiratory difficulty at any stage of the disease need to seek urgent medical care, he advised.� �Whenever a person develops a cough and cold, and even if it�s a viral illness, patients expect antibiotics to be prescribed. They demand antibiotics from the doctor or sometimes self-medicate themselves after obtaining medicine from pharmacies.Patients who are having mild symptoms can usually be safely managed at home with adequate hydration bed rest and paracetamol being given for the fever, said the doctor.� ��Secondary Infections cause more harm than influenza�The majority of those who are aware and taking precautions against influenza believe that it�s the primary disease or the influenza that causes severe illness and death in patients. This is not so, according to the many specialists that the Daily Mirror consulted. All of them agree that while influenza can sometimes cause pneumonia and other severe disease, it�s usually the secondary bacterial infections that arrive after developing pneumonia which causes more harm to the patients.� ��Damage caused to the respiratory tract by the influenza virus makes it easier for the other bacteria to enter and cause infections, explained Dr. Gunathilake, further stating that these can be more difficult to manage than the virus itself. Therefore he cautioned patients to be on the lookout for secondary infections after a viral infection of the respiratory tract. �These infections usually appear as fever reappearing 4/5 days after subsiding of other symptoms�, he commented.� ���Lack of guidance on how to address the present situation��D. D. K. Wickra,chchi Matara Divisional Secretary�When inquired into the initiatives taken by the Government to address the current health problem in the country, Matara Divisional Secretary D. D. K. Wickramaarachchi said that the Government had taken measures to close the primary schools with the onset of the viral flu. These schools were scheduled to be reopened yesterday (May 30). According to Wickramaarachchi, classroom sessions were conducted as usual for students in other grades although a significant drop was witnessed in the number of students who were present. �Plying along the Pasgoda, Kotapola and Kamburupitiya roads, I noticed that there were only around four to five students in school vans that can usually accommodate around twenty. These were students who were returning� home from school and the number was very low compared to the number of students one may observe in a school van on a regular day.� �There is a general fear in sending children to school under the prevailing situation. It has reached a point where the Karapitiya Hospital is no longer receiving additional child patients to the children�s ward in the hospital. My personal view on the matter is that it�s better to close the schools at least until the health authorities issue an official announcement, stating that the prevailing disease situation has been brought under control in the country. To my knowledge, I believe that the Ministry of Health has still not made any official statement regarding the disease. However, it should be noted that even in Matara, there is a general fear that the disease might spread. Currently we are facing a problem due to the lack of proper guidance on how to address the present situation� Wickramaarachchi said.� ��The Ministry�s silence is causing undue panic among the�citizens���Stating that there are five main hospitals in the south comprising the main hospitals of Karapitiya Teaching Hospital in Galle, the Teaching Hospital in Maha Modara, General Hospital in Matara, Labima Hospital in Kotawila and the District General Hospital in Hambanthota, Wickramaarachchi continued that statistically, it is difficult to assume how many patients with the virus have been admitted to these hospitals. �Also, it is certainly not within my purview or knowledge to statistically determine the number of patients currently admitted to the hospitals for treatment.�Nevertheless, children have been advised to wear a mask to avoid contracting the disease. But, it�s equally important to ensure that these masks are worn by them in the correct manner to avoid the spread of the disease. On the other hand, there is speculation that the influenza disease might spread again in the months of July and August although this needs to be verified since the information is coming from unofficial sources. Also, given that this is the rainy season, now there prevails a risk of dengue spreading in the locality. As a country, we have not impressed enough weight on this matter despite it being a burning social issue that needs to be addressed immediately� he concluded.� �"
Sri Lanka�s critical care speciality  not evolving,"2018-05-25 02:37:55							0						 				2104","�Medical specialities evolve for the benefit of patients. It resolves the demand and enhances clinical effectiveness.We are duty bound to support this evolution and create specialist services to serve the need.Quality healthcare is based on this concept and it is patient-centred, not provider centric. Accordingly, doctor training pathways need modification with relevant competencies to produce specialists with matching new skills.Such doctors are traditionally board certified as specialists via an �exit� examination (MD) to achieve a minimum national standard or benchmark. Today, board certification of critical care specialists in Sri Lanka has no �exit� examination, but is primarily testimonials based. This needs urgent redress.� �The impetus for the formation of a specialty board for critical care medicine in 2008 under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses of the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) was the plight of junior medical officers serving in intensive care units. The aim was to develop critical care medicine training with multi-disciplinary professional input. After much thought and discussion, a diploma critical care medicine curriculum (DCCM) was installed in 2009 based on the CoBaTrICE model (An International Competency Based Training programme in Intensive Care Medicine for Europe and other world regions) as a stepping stone for a higher degree in Critical Care i.e. MD. The DCCM training programme was of high intensity (60 credits) and matched level 10 of Sri Lanka Quality Framework (SLQF). A world renowned critical care specialist was present as an examiner.� �A �standard� and an �alternate� pathway for the transition period were proposed in 2011. This �alternate� pathway allowed anaesthetists practising critical care medicine to continue to do so and enter a trainee tailored training programme until the country produced a sufficient number of MD qualified critical care specialists via the �standard� pathway. This model was approved by the Senate of the University of Colombo. The purpose was to create an independent �standard� training programme for Critical Care Medicine and phase out the �alternate� pathway by 2016.� �In 2011, the College of Anesthesiologists took over the reins of this training programme virtually by force and the Board of Study in Anaesthesiology (BOS-A) saw its responsibilities being sanctioned for 1 year by the PGIM in the first instance. But they continued regardless. Sadly, for the past 8 years, no action has been taken to promote the �standard pathway� of training. The above diplomats were neither given an opportunity to take up appropriate leadership roles to shape up critical care services in Sri Lanka nor was a window opened for them for further training for MD. As a direct consequence, many of the diplomats migrated and became consultant critical care specialists elsewhere. The exodus was inevitable. The PGIM failed in its duties to the trainees and public alike.� �Scrapping of diploma programmeInstead of promoting this training program, the College of Anaesthetists decided to do away with the diploma programme by demoting its value and removed its foreign examiner. It decided to hold onto the �alternate� pathway of training as the final destination to critical care specialisation. Repeated requests by the Ministry of Health to install the �standard� training pathway fell on deaf ears. The Ministry of Health, the biggest employer of doctors in Sri Lanka, desperately wanted the above diplomats with intermediate training in Critical Care to maintain a credible intensive care service in its hospitals.The lack of recognition of the problem and the inability to rectify the issues raised make the current specialty board in critical care medicine, hosted within the BOS-A, not fit for its purpose. If no action is taken, the DCCM would have no trainee applicants and specialty development of Critical Care Medicine in Sri Lanka will see a natural demise. In order to conceal this diverse interest, dual board certification in critical care medicine was offered to anesthetists. This self-served privilege was proposed, scrutinised and approved by the same board of study (BOS-A) constituted of only anesthetists. No �exit� examination on critical care medicine was necessary.� �In the PGIM, competence-based training pathways exist similar to DCCM. Ironically, anesthesia is one of them. In its training, the BOS-Ahas hosted a Part 1 A (a clinical practice-based examination) at the end of the 1st year of training followed by a Part 1 B, a theory test and the final Part 2 MD as its exit examination for decades. Thus,BOS-Ais fully aware of the need of basic clinical competence training for the junior members practicing anesthesia, but denies the same for critical care. Modern critical care is not a speciality that can be remotely managed from home or whilst engaged in another job in the operating theatre. The patient outcomes in critical care heavily depends on the presence of highly trained doctors and nurses on-site (24/7) and capable of recognising and rectifying deteriorating trends and mishaps long before irreversible damage is done.� �PGIM and evolving needs�Both critical care medicine and emergency medicine were recommended to be accepted as separate specialities in Sri Lanka by the then Minister of Health, the current President Maithripala Sirisena in 2011 following a review of its timely need. The University of Colombo hosts the only Institute of Post Graduate medical training in this country. Therefore, as a public funded organisation, the PGIM is obliged to shape up its training programs to serve the evolving needs of the Ministry of Health that serves all citizens of Sri Lanka.� �Every clinical specialty encounters disease conditions that would need intensive care. Therefore, every clinician has a right to participate in the care of their patients, in a critically ill state, to resolve therapies of the original illness. A majority of patients needing critical care services have coexisting medical and surgical problems. Thus, multi-disciplinary inputs are essential to direct training until critical care specialists are produced.� �Medicine evolves with time. When Hippocrates initiated medicine as a profession, there were no specialities. Specialities evolved to enhance care for patients and improve outcomes. Thus, the sole purpose of generation of specialities is natural, initially born as a sub-specialty of a parent specialty and then raised to become independent with time with greater experience in its development. For example, there were no paediatricians in 1970�s, but they evolved from adult physicians. In 1990s it was clear that paediatricians could not offer the best services for neonates and hence neonatologists emerged. Although paediatricians were nurtured initially by the College of Physicians, they claim no ownership of paediatrics as a sub-specialty. A similar pathway of development will have to be followed for critical care medicine.� �The evolution of critical care medicine in the world began with the concentration of essential equipment and staff in one place of the hospital to serve the most sick patients; a concept first initiated by Florence Nightingale in 1850�s. In 1950�s with a polio epidemic in Denmark, mechanical ventilation was instituted and quite rightly anesthetists had a major role to play. However, with evolution of medicine it became clear that critical care needs new skills to improve the outcome of patients.� �The historical contribution by the College of Anaesthetists for the development of critical care medicine should be celebrated, as well as their continued involvement to produce trained future specialists in critical care. This is because some transferable skills of anaesthesia are needed for critical care specialist training. Critical Care specialists encompass other skills and competencies including the ability to lead a team of multi-professional doctors for the benefit of critically ill patients. Multi-organ failure resulting from dengue is one such example. Several recent media reports involving VIPs allude to the consequences of lack of team work.� �The very fact that the Sri Lanka College of Anaesthesiologists denial of� the need for multi-professional input to critical care medicine development is testimony to its intentions to delay its progress to become an independent specialty in this country, but why? It is also unfair that a junior doctor is expected to complete his training in anaesthetics as enforced by the BOS-A to be able to commence training in critical care. This is not dissimilar from demanding compulsory training to be a �cricketer� before becoming eligible to be a trainee �rugby player� just because cricketers� training pathway had a transferable skill such as running.� �DCCM Examination�It is also surprising that PGIM has allowed board certification of a �specialty� for such a long time with no �exit� examination in its training pathway. The only credible critical care specialty-based examination held by the PGIM to date is the DCCM which is more comprehensive and detailed than any contained in anaesthesia prospectuses. In fact, the diploma holders have undergone the exact duration of critical care medicine training to that of post MD anaesthesia trainees who have become eligible for board certification in critical care without a single �exit� examination in critical care medicine.� �Critical Care Medicine already has established sub-specialities in cardiac, neuro, paediatric, renal and liver care in developed countries, and is usually primary disease oriented, and maintains inputs from primary referring specialists. A critical care specialist predominantly focuses on establishing (resuscitation) and maintaining adequate vital organ function by means of pharmacological, physiological, or artificial manipulation or replacement therapy. The primary aim of such stabilisation and maintenance of vital functions is to borrow time in life for natural healing process to take place assisted by the specific therapies instituted by relevant specialists until sustainable organ function has returned naturally or via artificial support of organs or following transplantation.� �In the UK, for example, intensive care medicine (ICM), now termed critical care medicine, achieved specialty status in 1999. In the early 1990�s the foundation of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine was by seven parent colleges. This new faculty wasn�t a destination, but was a starting point to establish Critical Care Medicine as a separate specialty. In 1992, the Royal Colleges in the UK formed the Joint Advisory Committee for Intensive Therapy and this became the Intercollegiate Board for Training in ICM in 1996. This was very similar to the establishment of a Specialty Board in Critical Care Medicine under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses in 2008 in Sri Lanka, but sadly moved away for sole management by BOS-A in 2011. This has effectively denounced the need for development of a multidisciplinary professional identity in critical care training in Sri Lanka.� �In January 2011, the General Medical Council (GMC) required Faculty of ICM-UK to develop a primary specialty training programme for ICM, a fact that the Sri Lankan College of Anaesthesiologists ignore to be in existence. Instead, the Sri Lanka College of Anaesthesiologists renamed themselves to include intensive care in 2014 without committing to the essential pillars needed for critical care medicine development. In contrast to the GMC, the Sri Lanka Medical Council remains silent.� �I hope wisdom will prevail in this ongoing saga. It�s our responsibility to ensure that a safe, effective, efficient, well-led service is delivered to the public through the maintenance of the highest standards of training. Specialty formation should be to achieve the above for patients and not to retain territorial boundaries for provider gain. Moving the Speciality Board for Critical Care Medicine to be hosted under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses shall mark a new beginning.�(The writer is a Professor of Anaesthesiology (2002-2013) from the University of Peradeniya and can be reached via E mail cgoonase@sltnet.lk)Acknowledgement: Mahes Salgado for manuscript assistance.� �"
Sugar puts Tea industry in a dilemma,"2018-05-23 00:00:47							0						 				5636","''WE WANTED TO CONDUCT THIS TEST SECRETLY""�It was last February that the story of 53 tea factories, which allegedly adulterate tea with sugar during production, was revealed. The raids on these tea factories had been carried out by the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB). The Minister of Plantation Industries of Sri Lanka Navin Dissanayake said that any culprits found guilty would be punished severely. This was revealed through �Sathya Gaveshana� ( Exploration into the truth) an expos article which appeared in our sister newspaper ..Lankadeepa. But, the SLTB has to now check whether it adhered to the proper procedures when doing its research. When it comes to regulations relevant to the tea industry, why does the SLTB, being the legal authority, become so powerless? This week�s exploration is about the much talked about story in the tea industry.�This investigation, that was done under the leadership of the former SLTB Chairman Rohan Pethiyagoda, is the first of its kind in the history of Sri Lanka tea. However, he retired from service one month after this investigation; termed as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The position he vacated was filled by Lusil Wijewardena, no stranger to the tea industry. He was entrusted with the task of taking action against the allegations levelled against the 53 tea factories. But there emerged another problem because the alleged factory owners� stand was that they aren�t guilty.Minister Dissanayake said no quick decisions could be made and it would take about three months before arriving at a conclusionThey have taken steps to challenge the investigation, said to have been done in keeping with a pure scientific method. The minister in charge later afforded an opportunity to the factory owners to express their views. Accordingly, the minister had a discussion on March 29 with the these tea factory owners and the officers of the SLTB. As a result, these factory owners got the opportunity to express their views in writing. But the SLTB encountered an unexpected situation; they had to verify the outcome of the investigation they had already carried out.� �In the meantime Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti made a written request to Minister Dissanayake to publish the relevant list of factory owners alleged to have adulterated the tea during manufacturing. His request was to reveal at least the names of 27 factory owners among the 80 factories who have produced tea by reasonable means. When inquired by journalists, a senior officer of the SLTB said that it was not possible to reveal the names of those concerned because no final decision had been arrived at thus far.� �However, Pethiyagoda, who was in the forefront of this investigation, is no more with the SLTB. The tea board does not seem to be interested in the relevant research methodology as well. When journalists made inquiries in this regard, Minister Dissanayake said no quick decisions could be made and it would take about three months before arriving at a conclusion. This scenario highlights a negative aspect associated with the tea board. The SLTB has a research institute as well and should be in a position to take responsibility with whatever activities it carries out. The counter allegations made by these factory owners have been aimed at distorting the truth. If this is how the SLTB takes responsibility it�s no shock to see that �Ceylon tea� has become a subject of controversy.� �When it comes to the tea industry there are many processes which are connected to it. For instance a number of activities such as tea production, export, brokerage, import and packing are involved in the tea industry. In the event of stemming a defect associated with any process, it is inevitable that the entire tea industry will be affected adversely. Given the present crisis it seems that contributions have been made by the tea plucker to the labourer to intensify the problem in the tea industry. The Tea Small Holders� Association claims that it is dumped in a chaotic situation when there is a tug-of-war between the SLTB and the tea factory owners. According to them, the main reason for this competition in the market is that despite there being an increase in the number of tea factories it has not been in proportion with the production which has remained low. In reality it is the tea small holders who are in danger because they have to see to the welfare of 2 million dependents. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the authorities to take note of their grievances.� �There are various differences of opinion among the business community and the groups who are connected to this industry. These differences were highlighted in the media. However much of these differences are associated with wrong opinions, which have led to arguments. The best example for this is the tea board of neighbouring India. The Tea Board of India (TBI) acts as a facilitator to help people identify real tea from the tea that has been adulterated with colouring. In this aspect the TBI adheres to a rigid policy. Various strategies have been introduced to identify the real products. These strategies not only help the consumer to avoid buying bogus products but also assists the authorities to nab the culprits. They publish newspaper advertisements in this regard. India in comparison to Sri Lanka reveals the truth about the team that�s produced in her country. India makes it a point to make it known to consumers that the future of a tea brand depends solely on honesty and trustworthiness.� �It was last year that the tea industry in Sri Lanka celebrated its 150th Anniversary. But, the negative news about the defects in the island�s tea has spoiled the anniversary celebrations. Sri Lanka should not forget that it is facing a challenging situation when other players in the tea market like Kenya and India are doing well. Sri Lankan tea is bought by countries like Russia, Iraq and Iran. It is not very healthy for the SLTB to take such an irresponsible stand because there are so many dependents. It should reveal the truth about the wrong doing of the factory or otherwise accept defeat. If this isn�t done it is the �Ceylon Tea� brand name that�ll suffer because as of now the country�s tea is termed �impure�. This is a time when the entire tea industry must remember that old Sinhalese saying, �an act of washing clothes and dipping them again in muddy waters�.� ��Cultivators are in trouble� - Kularatna�Association of All Ceylon Tea Development Small Tea Estates Alliance� �Chairman K.L. Kularatna said that tea is presented to the world saying it�s �Pure Ceylon Tea�.� �It will damage to the reputation of tea. This is an industry which paves the way to earn the living of 2 million people. There may be only six hundred factory owners. They are engaged in unnecessary competition to earn profits. Now they have a harvest of about three to four hundred kilos from each acre.This is not sufficient. Factories are increased while the production of tea is going down. Then the tender leaves are not sufficient to meet the capacity of the factory. Then they make various methods to increase production. Small tea owners are doing this for their living. We are in trouble due to the work of this small group. Most of the investors are local people who have invested more money on this tea industry.Tea factory owners can change this business, but we can�t do it. We are experiencing� a major crisis.��We wanted to conduct this test secretly�� ��The following are excerpts of an interview done with the former Chairman of Sri Lanka Tea Board Rohan Pethiyagoda.� �Q What sort of test was conducted by SLTB in connection with blending tea with sugar?� �The issue of tea being mixed with sugar has been prevalent for sometime. I thought of a new method to verify the truth of this charge in a quick way without waiting for the processing of the black tea. Various properties of sugar are subject to several chemical changes during heating. Any difference detected in the tea leaves during the process of drying, after grinding, proves that the tea has been mixed with sugar. But some were of the view that this test could be done only with black tea and it didn�t surface in the mind of anyone that this test could be easily done at the factory premises. When tea leaves are put in water before they are put in the oven at the factory, the tea begins to dilute and will taste sweet, if sugar has been added. This is a simple and easy method of testing whether there is sugar in tea.� �Q But the alleged factory owners maintain that sugar, to a certain degree, is an inherent property of tea itself. How do you explain this view?� �It�s true that sugar is naturally found in tea leaves and also in other kinds of leaves. But this sugar is present in fructose form and includes glucose and sucrose. This is less than one percent of the sugar which is produced by the leaf itself. However there is no possibility of increasing this minute degree of sugar during the drying and grinding stages.� �We deployed them in groups of two according to the list of factories. Instructions were given to take samples and transport them in cabs while keeping the mobile phones off. What was happening was not known to them - Rohan PethiyagodaQ There is another allegation that this test has been conducted without the direct involvement of SLTB.Your comments.� �We wanted to conduct this test secretly. We didn�t even use the SLTB�s vehicles as drivers would come to know about our task. This would have made the factory staff take every precaution to stop their misconducts. I made arrangements to bring the relevant officers to the auditorium of the Tea Research Institute in Kottawa, Galle by inviting them to a so-called farewell party on my retirement from the SLTB.� �We deployed them in groups of two according to the list of factories. Instructions were given to take samples and transport them in cabs while keeping the mobile phones off. What was happening was not known to them.� �If they had known about our purpose their abuses in the processing of tea would not have been detected.� �Q� Why is sugar added in the processing of tea?� �Ferrous sulfate, potassium permanganate, sodium hydroxide and sugar are added to give a black colour to the tea. Black tea is expensive and Arabian countries prefer this type of tea. Normally processed tea is grayish in colour. The other thing is that sugar helps in the process of fine grinding. The third factor is the weight. A kilo of sugar costs only Rs.100 while a kilo of tea is Rs 600-700.� �Q Some accept that they mix sugar with tea and also argue that there is no harm in this blending process.� �A scientist at the Tea Research Institute (TRI) in 1971 prescribed as acceptable a small amount of sugar to be mixed with the tea. This was included in a research paper. However some factory owners have taken it as a recommendation of the TRI. There are easy and profitable ways of manufacturing tea. But it should comply with the legal requirements.We assure the quality of our tea when dealing with the international market. If the real sate of our tea is revealed it will badly affect the produce from Sri Lanka. Other main exporters like India and Kenya follow strict procedures in the operating of their tea industries.� �The mixed tea tends to develop a certain fungus three months after the tea auctions and becomes unsalable. These factory owners should realise that they are causing a bad global impression when they do this to our tea.� �Q TRI is preparing to do a review of this particular test. Do you agree to such a review?� �For our tests we brought down samples of withered tea leaves and leaves of the later stages to Colombo. These samples were brought by the tea inspectors employed under the Commissioner of Tea. They were sealed and signed samples and were also given to the factory owners to avoid any possible disputes.Therefore the allegation of blending tea in Colombo is not true. There was transparency when these tests were done. If there is any suspicion a sample could be retested.�Private Tea Factory Owners� Association behind issue� �Following are excerpts of an interview done with a factory owner who is shrouded in allegations.Q What happened really?� �That is the general methodology used by SLTB. We are harassed first and then slapped with a fine of Rs.50,000 or 100,000. The factory owners pay the fine because they can�t bear the oppression. The SLTB is an institution where bureaucracy reigns supreme. The main question is whether they have done this to stop the malpractices in the tea industry or whether their aim is to be in the good books of the Minister. Even the officers of the SLTB aren�t aware of this methodology. Opinion is divided within the SLTB itself.� �Q� But, hasn�t it been proved that tea is adulterated with sugar?� �The sugar level in the tea may fluctuate due to the climate, fertilizer and manner in which tea leaves are plucked. It is practically difficult to prepare a baseline. On the other hand, the chemical composition in tea differs from the places where the leaves are plucked. Tea leaves are put into the dryer after 2 hours of withering and rolling. No recent study has been done in this regard. The SLTB proved that the glucose content is more in the rolled leaf than in the withered one. These claims aren�t scientific because the carbohydrate content increases as soon as the leaf is put in the roller. The HPLC methodology is only a reading.� �The SLTB should get involved in this and find out what�s happening. There is a big problem of labour in Sri Lanka - A factory ownerQ� More or less, sugar in the tea may appear as fructose and glucose whereas there may be a slight presence of sucrose. Do you support the argument that there is no reason to increase the natural sugar content while drying and grinding tea leaf?� �That is wrong. There is ample evidence of research to prove it. This person who is making this claim has no knowledge about botany. If that is so, this person should do a research and prove it. Really, the former chairman wanted to show that he is a big shot.� �Q� Do you accept the suggestion that the sealed tea sample test can dispel doubts?� �That is useless. For instance the average value of blood samples should be known to see whether there is dengue. Comparisons are done like that. Here, there is no average value to be compared. What are here are his dimensions. That is not a definition.� �Q Are there people who adulterate tea with sugar?� �Yes. We have to find out why do they do so? The quality of the Sri Lanka tea is gradually declining. The SLTB should get involved in this and find out what�s happening. There is a big problem of labour in Sri Lanka. The people in the past plucked tea leaf every five days. Later these figures changed from seven to ten days. If mature leaf is adulterated with sugar then it will become wet. When we get 25 kgs. of plucked tea leaves by paying 6 dollars, the countries like Kenya pay 1 dollar and get 60 kgs of plucked leaves. It is useless boasting about �Ceylon Tea� without having a means to survive.The SLTB is an institution where bureaucracy reigns supreme. The main question is whether they have done this to stop the malpractices in the tea industry or whether their aim is to be in the good books of the Minister. - A factory ownerQ� Do you say that there is no problem in mixing tea with sugar?� �Really, there is no problem. Even though sugar is mixed, it will not remain as we boil the tea in a high temperature. For instance, this is not an act similar to mixing brick dust with chili powder. On the other hand, all types of chemicals are sprayed in the growing process until the tea leaves are brought to the factory after plucking. If there is nothing like that there is no need for the tea board to intervene. It is the �Brahman� caste or the Private Tea Factory Owners� Association which is behind this. In the chairman�s factory, 15,000 kgs of tea is not produced per month. Their factories are closing down on a daily basis. They who are unable to face the competition and are trying to close the biggest factories in Sri Lanka.� �Q� What did you demand from Prime Minister?� �To start a scholarly discussion including the tea board and factory owners. We also asked to conduct a research with the Tea Research Institute. Now there are bogus tea plants all over Sri Lanka. The Tea Board must be committed to start genuine tea nurseries. But, they do not address these real problems.���It is baseless to make allegations� - Ranasinghe��Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association Chairman Harith Ranasinghe said that if sugar is mixed with tea, the weight and color change resulting in extra profits. �Then they can overcome others. Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association is not going behind anyone. The Minister was informed in one voice by the Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association to inquire into this as it is a disgrace to the name of Sri Lanka Tea, if such a things are happening,� he said.���Methodology needs to be examined� - EdirisingheTea Commissioner E.A.J.K Edirisinghe said that all 53 factories have already submitted reports on the production process of their factories. They are now being studied by the Tea Board. Their main concern is about the methodology applied by the Tea Board in the testing process. Therefore we are now reviewing our testing methodology.� ���"

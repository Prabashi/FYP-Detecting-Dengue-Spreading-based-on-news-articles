b'Political crisis in SL threatens justice efforts: HRW',"b'Thu, 17 Jan 2019 16:08:56 +0000'","b'2019-01-17 16:08:56\n\nSri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s political upheaval undermined stalled processes aimed at providing truth and justice for abuses from the country\xe2\x80\x99s civil war, Human Rights Watch said today in releasing its World Report 2019.\n\nThe crisis subsided after the Supreme Court ruled on December 13 that the president\xe2\x80\x99s dissolving of parliament was unconstitutional, and Mahinda Rajapaksa stepped down as proclaimed prime minister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe many victims of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s three-decade long civil war have seen their diminishing hopes for justice further delayed by presidential politics,\xe2\x80\x9d said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \xe2\x80\x9cThis tragedy highlights the failure of the Sirisena government to take swift, meaningful steps toward accountability.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the 674-page World Report 2019, its 29th edition, Human Rights Watch reviewed human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In his introductory essay, Executive Director Kenneth Roth says that the populists spreading hatred and intolerance in many countries are spawning a resistance. New alliances of rights-respecting governments, often prompted and joined by civic groups and the public, are raising the cost of autocratic excess. Their successes illustrate the possibility of defending human rights \xe2\x80\x93 indeed, the responsibility to do so \xe2\x80\x93 even in darker times.\n\nThe administration of Rajapaksa was implicated in egregious violations during the final months of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s brutal civil war in 2009, and in suppression of freedoms of the media, expression, and association. After Maithripala Sirisena won the election in 2015, the government improved the climate for civil society, reversed some repressive measures, and supported a resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council that promoted four transitional justice mechanisms for truth and accountability.\n\nOf these four, only the Office of Missing Persons has been formed, but it has yet to become fully functional. Families in the north and east have held protests and vigils to demand the return of their land from military occupation and to seek the truth about disappeared family members. The political turmoil over the country\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and the possible return of a Rajapaksa administration raised fears not only of further delays in justice, but of retribution against those pressing for government action. The Supreme Court ruling and Rajapaksa\xe2\x80\x99s concession ended the turmoil.\n\nLong-promised security sector reforms are also stalled. Although the government proposed a new counterterrorism law to repeal the draconian and long-abused Prevention of Terrorism Act, the bill did not meet international human rights standards.\n\nOne important advance for justice was the indictment, in November, of the chief of defense staff, Adm. Ravindra Wijegunaratne, for protecting a navy officer accused of abducting and killing 11 ethnic Tamil civilians during the civil war.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s past pledges to provide justice to conflict victims and to initiate reforms have fallen by the wayside amid political turmoil,\xe2\x80\x9d Ganguly said. \xe2\x80\x9cSri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s friends need to press the government to meet its commitments to people who have suffered for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d'","b'Sri Lanka&rsquo;s political upheaval undermined stalled processes aimed at providing truth and justice for abuses from the country&rsquo;s civil war, Human Rights Watch said today in releasing its World Report 2019.'",b'http://www.dailymirror.lk/161210/Political-crisis-in-SL-threatens-justice-efforts-HRW'

The GMOA is not a trade union that serves the profession or the patients but a political outfit that promotes hatred and conflicts,\xe2\x80\x9d Minister Senaratne charged.\n\nIt was extremely difficult to take action against members of the GMOA who have been charged for medical negligence including raping patients. If and when they feel an incident in the Health Ministry, a hospital or a medical institution affects their dictatorial influence on the state health sector they behave like a gang of thugs and never hesitate to take the law into their own hands.\n\nMinister Senaratne pointed out that the GMOA commits all these malicious and venomous acts with the aim of bringing its President to Parliament through the national list of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) at the next general election.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), the regulator of the medical profession, was run in the past like a monopoly of the GMOA and promoted its agenda. I have decided to change the composition of the GMOA to put an end to the GMOA\xe2\x80\x99s monopoly on it and set up an SLMC with the policies and principles similar to the British Medical Council. A committee of eminent persons has been appointed to make recommendations to the new SLMC in this regard,\xe2\x80\x9d Minister Senaratne stressed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been commended, praised and given awards not by Sri Lanka or the Sri Lankan media but by global agencies like the World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO) and many countries for what I have done for free health services in Sri Lanka. I have brought down the prices of nearly 75 essential drugs, thereby reducing the monthly medical bill of millions of diabetic, heart, arthritis, asthma and kidney patients in this country.\n\nSince I was given the responsibility to run the Health Ministry in 2015, I have lifted the upper limit of Rs.1.5 million for free medication meant for cancer patients and today the Health Ministry spends up to Rs. 40 to 50 million for drugs per year to save the life of one cancer patient. A Stent for a heart patient costs around Rs. 450, 000. A contact lens for an eye patient costs around Rs. 30, 000. Both are today supplied by the Health Ministry free of charge saving the lives of thousands of heart patients and providing sight to thousands of patients. Stents and lenses are imported by the Health Ministry from the US and are of the highest quality. But the sad part of this is that I get calls from patients complaining that doctors were asking them to purchase Stents and contact lenses from the pharmacy they recommend. You know who gets the commission for from this process. They never talk about free Stents or lenses,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted.\n\nMinister Senaratne noted that no one talks about the enormous service rendered to the country by the Indian funded \xe2\x80\x98Suvasariya 1990\xe2\x80\x99 free ambulance service that has saved the lives of millions by providing them with much needed pre-hospital care.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9dThis is a service ridiculed and insulted by the GMOA by saying it was an arm of the Indian secret service RAW and served by Indian doctors, medical staff and drivers depriving Sri Lankans of job opportunities,\xe2\x80\x9d Minister Senaratne charged.\n\nSince 2015, the number of cancer units, blood banks, accidents services, maternity care units have doubled or even trebled in Sri Lanka providing more and more facilities to patients. The number of heart transplants, kidney transplants, arm and leg transplants have also increased with ultra-modern equipment, drugs etc being introduced and hundreds of new hospitals being constructed.

Therefore, those who accuse us of committing an act of sabotage should question Mr. Amaraweera. Who would want the country\xe2\x80\x99s agriculture industry destroyed? The spreading of fall armyworm is an issue to the whole of South Asian and African regions. It is visible in some parts of America as well. This is not a species that had been bred artificially. The only solution discovered so far has not been proved effective as what is done under it is driving away the worm. Such an attempt is not an effective solution as the pest could get to adjoining plantations. It could move 80 metres overnight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nHe said the government had decided to go for a national programme to destroy the pest and save the crops. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will go for a two-week programme to enlighten farmers on the issue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

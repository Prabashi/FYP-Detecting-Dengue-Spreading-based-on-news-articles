b'Allocating new parking space for Sanath at Trillium Residencies - Nothing improper: CMA',"b'Sat, 12 Jan 2019 01:39:38 +0000'","b'2019-01-12 01:39:38\n\nThe proper procedure was followed when allocating a parking space to former cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya at the Colombo Trillium Residencies where he had been earlier deprived of a parking space, Condominium Management Authority (CMA) General Manager R.K. Jayaweera said.\n\nThe problem arose with Trillium Management Corporation when a pump house was built at the parking lot belonging to Mr. Jayasuriya without his consent when his apartment had been rented out to some Japanese.\n\nThe pump house had made it difficult for Mr. Jayasuriya park his vehicle and as such had made several complaints to the management of the Trillium Residencies.\n\nMr. Jayaweera told Daily Mirror that the Trillium Management Corporation had made a complaint to the CMA that Mr. Jayasuriya was using the car washing space provided to the residents to park his vehicle after he was left without a parking lot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Trillium Management Corporation was requesting the CMA to order Mr. Jayasuriya to avoid using the car washing area to park his vehicle. However, when we inquired into this matter, our legal officers were of the view that an injustice has been caused to Mr. Jayasuriya. Our officers recommended that justice be meted out to him and as such I decided to order the relevant authority to provide him with a parking lot from the Trillium\'s visitors parking lot. For this purpose we had to demolish a flower bed at this parking lot,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jayaweera said.\n\nHe said that though the officials of the Trillium Residencies kept pointing out that the demolition of the flower bed was illegal and that it required approval from the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), it was found that such approval from the CMC was unnecessary because this flower bed had not been marked in the ground plan as a flower bed.\n\nMr. Jayaweera said it appeared that the Trillium Residencies Management was making a deliberate effort to avoid allocating a parking lot to Mr. Jayasuriya with the purpose of embarrassing and inconveniencing him.\n\nSpeaking to the Media, Trillium Residencies Property Manager, Wayne Joseph said the demolition of the flower trough had been done without prior notice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe CMA has not received a court order to demolish the flower trough. This was done to provide Mr. Jayasuriya with a parking lot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, the CMA says that it has the legal authorityto do so without a court order.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said since the demolishing was illegal, the Trillium Management Corporation hoped to take legal action.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanath Jayasuriya told Daily Mirror that when he purchased the apartment from Trillium Residencies, he was provided with a parking lot as per his deed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter I purchased this apartment, I decided to rent it to some Japanese for an extended period of time. It was at that time that a pump house was built on my parking lot without consulting me or without my consent,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and added that he had decided last year to move into my apartment at the Trillium Residencies on a permanent basis.\n\nHe said it was his right to have parking lot as per the deed of ownership given to me by Trillium Residencies.\n\n""When I did not have a parking lot, the officials of Trillium Residencies asked me to park my vehicle some 200 meters away from my apartment. But I refused to do so as it was a source of inconvenience for me and my family,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jayasuriya said and added that the management was treating him unfairly and that was why he was demanding that his rights be restored.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I am happy that the CMA has taken steps to allocate me with a parking lot. But it has not been legally accessed to me. Hence, I decided to go to courts to get this the use of the parking lot inserted in my deed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'","b'The proper procedure was followed when allocating a parking space to former cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya at the Colombo Trillium Residencies where he had been earlier deprived of a parking space, Condominium Management Authority (CMA) General Manager R.K.

b'Aloysius barred from taking lawyer to CID',"b'Fri, 11 Jan 2019 04:30:07 +0000'","b'2019-01-11 04:30:07\n\nFiling a motion in the main inquiry relating to the bond scam, the defence counsel yesterday alleged that the CID had not allowed legal representation for suspect Arjun Aloysius when he reported to the CID last Sunday, January 6.\n\nAppearing on behalf Arjun Aloysius, Counsel Sajitha Jayawardena said when his client went to the CID to report his presence as directed by the court, he was not allowed to take his lawyers inside the Unit, thus depriving his right to legal representation.\n\nEarlier, when the suspects were being enlarged on exceptional bail, the Court imposed a condition on them to report to the CID every Sunday.\n\nWhen the Chief Magistrate questioned as to why such representation was required when reporting to the CID, the Counsel said that his client was under a lot of pressure that there could be a fabricated situation and that he had intervened with the witnesses which may result in cancelling his bail.\n\nMr. Jayawardena also said that his client had a language issue in understanding Sinhala documents. President\xe2\x80\x99s Counsel Navaratne Bandara also appearing for two lawyers, whose access into the CID were curtailed, said that the translation of the Sinhala texts relating to the signing documents were done to Aloysius by the other suspect Kasun Palisena on this occasion as his lawyers were not allowed to go in.\n\nHe said some CID officers had violated section 55 of the Police Ordinance by blocking the entry of lawyers and that it was a humiliation and harassment towards the lawyers.\n\nHowever, when the Magistrate questioned the officer who was in charge of that CID unit on that day, he said there was no previous practice as such to allow lawyers to go in with suspects who come only to sign and report to the CID as per court orders. He added that he further wanted to consult the director of the CID with regard to the issue that they never confronted this before.\n\nAfter inquiring into both parties, Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne said that any person had the right to have legal representation when going into any institution like the police, and that Arjun Aloysius also had the right to carry his lawyer inside the CID as his legal representation to assist him when reporting to the CID.\n\nHowever, the Magistrate also said such legal representation has boundaries as those lawyers cannot intervene with the procedural aspects of the CID officers in relation with the inquiry.

The Constitutional Council (CC), which claims to be independent, does not approve the nominees of the President as Supreme Court judges unless they belong to this religious denomination.\n\nThe situation is the same when it comes to our national cricket team,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Weerawansa argued. Minister of Justice, Thalatha Athukorala, pointed out that religion is not considered when appointing judges.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are making this allegation please name this judge and the religious denomination he belongs to,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the MP. MP Weerawansa then said he would reveal the names of these judges if a debate on the issue was held in the House.\n\nJVP MP Vijitha Herath, responding to the allegation made by Mr. Weerawansa, later said some of the Supreme Court Judges who belong to the religious denomination in question were appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no point in arguing about what religions denomination these judges belong to as they were appointed by the leaders of the political camp which Mr. Weerawansa himself is associated with,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Also, he said everyone should be free to practice his or her faith as it is a personal matter.

At the end point of  tolerance,"2018-05-09 00:00:24							0						 				330","Battered Meethotamulla residents demand their landsThe time was not at all auspicious for residents of Meethotamulla area back in 2017 on April 14th when the entire country was getting ready to welcome the Sinhala and Hindu New year. The garbage mount which covers a vast area collapsed without leaving a trace of property�and 31 lives.� �The Meethotamulla garbage mount received the attention of authorities in January, 2013 when Meethotamulla Sri Rahula Vidyalaya closed down. From then many protests were staged urging the authorities to halt garbage dumping in the area. At that time around 800 tons of garbage was dumped daily in the area which covers�approximately 17 Acres.� �The residents pointed out that it was a tragedy which could have been prevented. Under the Supreme Court order SCFR 218/2009 the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) had limited authority to dump garbage. However, contrary to the order, CMC continued to dump garbage�in this area.� �Despite the many campaigns held with the aim of eradicating dengue none of them was applicable to Meethotamulla. The area was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and there were many residents who contracted dengue. Residents in the area suffering from skin diseases and respiratory issues was common. Irrespective of the number of pleas, protests and the campaigns the authorities turned blind eye�to the issue.� �The loss of lives in April 2017 was an eye-opener to many. Some lives had to be sacrificed for the authorities to notice the issue and put a stop to the permanent dumping of garbage in Meethotamulla.� �A year has passed and there are residents in this area without homes. This is despite promises made to them by the authorities.� � Shantha Jayasinghe, a resident who lost his house and vehicle due to the collapse of the garbage mount, said that he was born and bred in the area and that the residents possessed deeds for the land they lived on. �We are not illegal residents despite some of the Media saying so� he said.� �He said that an estimate of forty Lakhs was made for the houses, but no estimate had been made so far regarding the�value of the land.� �Housing in flats� �The residents said that they were given Rs. 50,000 per month as a rent for three months. But this payment was halted after August 2017. During this period some of the residents were evacuated as they were living in areas which were identified as danger zones. Also some of the residents were evacuated considering the fact their houses were half or fully damaged. Some even got housing in flats.� �They point out that the basis of the valuation is not fair. And they again had to make requests regarding the�balance payments.� ��We had to go to Divisional Secretariat requesting for the balance of the compensation. Following a few meetings and requests being made, arrangements were made to give us the money due from August 2017,� the�residents said.� �The garbage mount still stands tall. The monument gives the indication that it is trying to relate a story about a section of the society that has been battered and betrayedKapila Perera, another resident who lost his house, said that there is another sect of residents who didn�t receive compensation. �Yes, we managed to receive compensation, but there are some residents who didn�t receive anything. There are residents who do not have title deeds, but a card instead which was given during the period of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa. But this card is not accepted anywhere nor is any guidance given to those residents,� he complained.� � Perera further said that although the media portray that 90% of the issues of the residents were solved this news is far from the reality.� �Fighting for what they deserve� ��It is indeed sad how some of the media portrayed this whole incident. Some of the people got the idea that the collapse of the garbage mount was a blessing in disguise as some residents got houses in flats. This is not true. We were left only with what we wore at that moment. Since then life has been a constant battle. We have not been given a permanent solution for the housing issue. We have to fight even to get what we deserve,� he said.� �The residents said that none of the Members of Parliament who represented the area followed up what had happened after the collapse of the dump. Adding to their woes none of the Non Governmental Organizations approached them to offer help. They live in constant fear as to what�would happen next.� ��Many promises were made. One of the promises made was to make this a green zone, but nothing has been done even after the lapse of a year. There is no plan for the next step. True, now they do not dump garbage here, but what are they going to do to the mount? It is still there. Sri Rahula Vidyalaya is still closed. Our Children faced not only health issues, but also had to deal with social concerns. Once the school was closed they were given new schools but were looked down by other students,� they said. They said that compared to other similar situations that developed in the country they were not offered any help to uplift their mental status.� ��When other disasters struck the country many steps were taken on behalf of the people�s welfare. During past disasters there was also psychological support for those affected. There were children who were to sit for the Grade five Scholarship Examination. This is one opportunity which a child gets to join a school that offers better facilities. After the devastation the children could not perform at the exam in keeping with expectations as they did not have books nor other psychological support. As parents we could not support them as we too were devastated at that time,� they said.� � The residents further said that if they aren�t provided with a reasonable solution by the Government the only option they have is to return to the area close to the garbage mount and build houses.�We were born and bred here. All our lives evolved here. If the Government is not going to dump garbage they can clear the area, improve infrastructure and give the lands back to the residents,� the residents said.� �Furthermore they said that although a committee had been set up, the only action taken so far was the removing of the Commissioner of the CMC.� ��It is not just the Commissioner who should be responsible for this. There were many people who are responsible. What is the use of removing just one official? It does not make any difference to our lives� the�residents argued.� �The garbage mount still stands tall. The monument gives the indication that it is trying to relate a story about a section of the society that has been battered and betrayed.� � When the Daily Mirror contacted Navin Mannapperuma, Director Western Province Waste Management Authority, he said that measures had been taken to make the garbage mount less active. �There are many garbage mounts like these in the world. Although many claim that the garbage here can be recycled, in reality we cannot use the entire mount for that purpose. What can be done is to make it inactive. There is a plan executed by University of Moratuwa along with the Ministry of Megapolis with regard to Meethotamulla,� he said.� � �",dengue

However, the President had to make the statement at the May Day rally to keep those who left with him by his side. Otherwise, he would lose them as well. At the same time, Mr. Sirisena is afraid of taking important decisions whereas the government keeps making unproductive decisions such as changing the day of May Day and Vesak,� he said.He said the government lacks the capability of managing the country as the number of dengue cases had increased due to mounting garbage dumps, garbage dumps have been collapsed killing people, prices of essential items including gas and milk power had increased and the underworld figures are roaming free.�Police officers have been deployed to provide security to a wedding of underworld figures. Police baton charges women. The government is incapable of administrating a Grama Niladhari areas let alone a country,� he said.Referring to the Salawa Army Camp Fire, he said the incident was not an accident but a planned event. ""Salawa was exploded systematically. Still, no compensation had been paid to the victims,"" Mr.Rajapaksa said.Meanwhile, he said both the President and the Prime Minister were attempting to outdo each other. �The President said the Premier was surrounded by the corrupt and the Premier set the trap for the President�s Chief of Staff,� he said.Taking a swipe at the government for fiscal mismanagement, Mr. Rajapaksa said they would salvage the country from what he called a �state financial terrorism,��We are ready to fight the state financial terrorism which burdens the masses.

Rosy Senanayake believes Colombo could be better than Malaysia,"2018-03-29 00:00:01							26						 				15661","Colombo�s first female Mayor Rosy Senanayake assumed duties last week and is in the process of �setting things right� at the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). During the run-up to the elections, Senanayake presented an elaborate manifesto addressing various issues in and around Colombo. One of her primary focuses includes developing underserved development areas. �The beauty of Colombo is that it�s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city,� she said in an interview with the Daily Mirror.�Excerpts:��	We are contracted to provide 700 metric tonnes of mixed garbage for this project by August 2019	The Govt. has identified Aruwakkalu as a permanent dumping place	The Govt. is in the process of streamlining the property registration process in the CMC	We have a waste-to-energy project which the Municipality has signed with a private entity	Social welfare projects would be concentrated 100% on these underserved development areas��Q� What are the immediate challenges that you have faced and would address in the near future?We have actually looked at a few (challenges), but garbage remains our number one priority. We had a meeting with the Prime Minister last week because we faced a crisis situation since the authorities at Muthurajawela stopped collecting mixed waste. We then had to negotiate with the Minister and within 48 hours we dumped the collection. I also believe that the residents have a responsibility in segregating the garbage. I have informed the Municipality to educate the residents because they cannot haphazardly dispose of garbage. We have a waste-to-energy project which the Municipality has signed with a private entity which would get off the ground by the end of 2019. A meeting was held and this will continue every month to see how far they have progressed. We are contracted to provide 700 metric tonnes of mixed garbage for this project by August 2019. By then I believe that most of our problems would be solved given that this project takes off.� �In the past, the Governments had not realized how waste could be a money-spinner. There are many facets and uses of waste. We also have had discussions to improve the health and sanitation sector next. The dengue mosquito and the epidemic normally happen in a cycle of twice every year. So we are getting ready to minimize the effects of breeding grounds. The Government is in the process of streamlining the property registration process in the CMC. The project spearheaded by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade is aimed at enhancing investment climate and paving the way for taxpayers to receive an efficient service at comparatively less cost. For this there are three stakeholders namely the Registrar General�s Office, the CMC and the Survey Department. We just signed the MoU with them. For the time being it�s a manual process and earlier to register the property in Colombo it took more than 30 days. The MoU will enable us to share information among all stakeholders. We are also preparing for Vesak.As Sri Lankans we need to celebrate all festivals. The beauty of Colombo is that it�s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city and we have always lived in harmony no matter what happens in the rest of the country. Hence, we have co-existed and therefore we need to celebrate each one�s cultural background and customs. There will be open houses and the municipality will encourage co-existence among different cultural communities. We are looking at the housing, underserved settlements and their needs etc.� �We have already appointed a committee to empower women and look into their needs and bring in multi-serving and multi-purpose community centres�Q� The CMC was in the news for several incidents related to bribery and corruption. How would you streamline the activities within�the Council?�Firstly it is about bringing in e-governance and instilling discipline in the Council. I�m also working on a mechanism to bring everyone to work, hence improving the quality of work. I also need to establish a Human Resource Department because roughly about 9000 people work here and there�s also a need to establish a few departments which are not in existence at the moment. Then we also could look at the social welfare and reward people for the work that they do, give them the incentives to come to work and put the place right.�They need to work with the correct frame of mind. If I am to train them on how to think creative and think global and move from where we are then I would do that as well. I strongly believe that Colombo could be better than Singapore or Malaysia. A little bit of effort and leadership is what is needed along with the right mechanism to take this city to heights beyond expectations.� �The beauty of Colombo is that it�s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city and we have always lived in harmony no matter what happens in the rest of the country�Q� A recent report by a Presidential Commission revealed that the Meethotamulla tragedy was the result of the municipality failing to carry out proper garbage disposal methods. What are your comments?�That�s the past and it was beyond my control. I need to study the report and understand the drawbacks. We are looking at the way forward. This is why we had discussions about the waste-to-energy project, consultations with the Megapolis Minister and PM to address the waste issue. In the past, Meethotamulla was a disaster because in order to beautify Colombo, waste was taken and dumped in our neighbour�s garden amidst their protests. These things were done in a haphazard way since the demise of Ranasinghe Premadasa. I don�t think successive Governments had any plans regarding what to do with Colombo�s waste or waste at large around the country.The present Government has identified Aruwakkalu as a permanent dumping place and they are now doing the groundwork. I�m looking at managing and handling Colombo city�s waste from the time I took over. But I would certainly study the report and see where we went wrong. Each ward member will have an App, so the residents of that ward can keep in touch with the member. Therefore ward members could educate their residents and get� them to be more responsible of keeping the city clean. Now that we have 47 wards in the six districts and having 47 ward members, putting in money to those wards to carryout the necessary infrastructure development I�m sure that we would be able to see a stronger and a better Colombo. This is �Our Colombo� as written in my slogan and this city is our responsibility. I�m hoping that the residents would support. My appeal to every member of the Municipality is to support us in our work, irrespective of their parties. Let�s start putting the city first.�In the past, the Governments had not realized how waste could be a money-spinner. There are many facets and uses of waste�Q� A majority of citizens in Colombo are from underprivileged areas.�You have said that the development of these areas will be prioritized. What is your plan?�My primary focus even with the 25 multi-purpose community centres is on the underserved areas because 1/3rd of the population lives in those areas. When I spoke about mixed garbage, when people don�t adhere to the norms, they all come from underserved areas. That�s not because they don�t understand or they are not disciplined; it is because they don�t have the provision. A normal house might have space to keep three different bins, but in a watte (A small area where people live), inside a tiny little room with five families I don�t think there�s room to put a bin. Therefore I have been telling the ward members to find a common place in the watte where the municipality can install a garbage disposal system.We need to look at housing, sanitation and water for them. When I spoke about maternity clinics and dispensaries I was addressing the underserved development areas. When it comes to social welfare projects it would be 100% concentrated on these underserved development areas. I had a discussion with a foreign diplomat to establish three vocational training centres and daycare centres because I want to increase the female participation in the labour force. In order to do that I need to develop the infrastructure including affordable day care centres, safe transportation, flexible hours created and so on. We would also be having a daycare for the Municipality. When we improve the lifestyles of people in these areas then major projects such as sewer lines, waste water, drainage and mass scale housing projects will be in our long term development plans.� �Each ward member will have an App. Therefore ward members could educate their residents and get� them to be more responsible of keeping the city clean�Q� Will future development activities of the city incorporate the �wathu� system or would they be demolished?� �It all depends. We still have to consider the availability of land to see the possibility of building houses for them. We have already appointed a committee to empower women and look into their needs and bring in multi-serving and multi-purpose community centres. Most of my plans will be focused on developing underserved development areas.� ��Q� Many people travel to Colombo daily to engage in work. Those such as tourists visit Colombo for leisure. How would you plan to develop facilities in a way that would benefit those visiting the city?� �The residents are approximately 550,000 people whereas about 600,000 migrate on a daily basis. This is why we had a discussion with the Architects� Association from the Chairman to the secretary who met with the Engineering Department and our architects to find out how to safeguard the cultural heritage. They want to focus on parks and improving services for the migrant citizens coming in on a daily basis because we have some major schools in the country. These include everything from public toilets, resting places, opening up more areas to have recreation facilities for families around the Beira, the Fort area and so on. We are also considering the buildings that have a heritage value and plan to restore and maintain them and give Colombo a new outlook. They were very enthusiastic and this is the groundwork that we would be doing during next three months. We would be able to see some tangible results hopefully.� �Firstly it is about bringing in e-governance and instilling discipline in the Council. I�m also working on a mechanism to bring everyone to work�Q� Many CMC workers are senior citizens who work day in and day out and receiving minimum wages. Are there plans to increase their salaries and incentives?� �That was one of the first questions I asked the department heads when I assumed duties. I want to read those contracts because we outsource many of these work. In those outsourcing contracts there are minimum age and salary scales. I have given all these contracts to my legal team to study them. I have advised the department heads to thoroughly review those contracts and to inform these people to be present at work, to adhere to what is written in the contract or step down. In future when we sign contracts we need to be specific about certain things such as salaries, age etc. This is why I need a HR department established.� ��Q� In a previous interview you mentioned about establishing rehabilitation centres for the youth. Along with these centres, how would the drug menace be mitigated in future?� �That is something that I have promised and would be doing within the next couple of months. I�m waiting for the Council to be formed in order to bring in resolutions to do many other things that are included in my manifesto. That�s a huge menace and it�s not an issue with just one strata of society, but it exists at every level. Much needs to be invested in terms of technical assistance and finances, but we would eventually make it a reality.� ��Q� During the previous Government most of the beautification projects were carried out under the purview of the Urban Development Authority (UDA). Why didn�t the CMC get involved?� �Some of the projects such as housing and infrastructure development with sewer waste etc would be done with the line ministries and the Central Government. The funding will also have to come from the Central Government. But the CMC can handle basic beautification projects. For example the Independence Square belongs to the UDA and we need to consider people who just park their vehicles and leave. I have instructed them to have an authorized parking space. When you have restrictions people can walk to their destination. I�ll also have to work with the Health Ministry and several other ministries in certain projects.� ���",dengue
Mobitel takes the lead in helping combating Dengue among school children with the  �DengueFreeChild� app,"2018-03-28 10:34:37							0						 				761","(From Left) Mr. Sunil Hettiarachchchi, Secretary � Ministry of Education, Mr. P. G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena, Chairman � Sri Lanka Telecom & Mobitel and Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Deputy Director General, Public Health Services officially launching the �DengueFreeChild� app.Mobitel, Sri Lanka�s National Mobile Service Provider, launched an innovative mobile app to help combat the spread of Dengue among school children in Sri Lanka at a special event held at the BMICH on 27 March 2018.The �DengueFreeChild� app was developed by Mobitel in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the University of Colombo and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The app enables users to proactively report of Dengue or suspected Dengue fever so that action can be taken to the premises around which the infection is prevalent for mosquito breeding areas as well as to alert other parents to keep a keen eye on Dengue-like symptoms in their own children.Around 30 percent of all Dengue patients who sought treatment in 2017 were children, according to the data collected by the National Dengue Control Unit of the Ministry of Health.��Early diagnosis of Dengue can save a child�s life,� says Dr. Hasitha Tissera, National Coordinator of the National Dengue Control Unit. �We have found that early diagnosis of Dengue and immediate treatment almost always leads to a complete recovery. The need for parents and carers to be alert and aware of the possibility of Dengue symptoms in their children cannot be overstated.�Recent statistics revealed that there are nearly 4.4 million students in more than 10,000 schools across Sri Lanka today. As the Dengue mosquito is reported to be active during the morning hours, students are all at greater risk of being infected if mosquito breeding grounds exist in schools and surrounding areas. The app creates awareness and allows sharing of information quickly that enables parents and school authorities to take preventive action to stop the spread of Dengue. Ministry of Education through Health and Nutrition Division is actively contributing to maintain schools free of dengue breeding sites. Therefore, this new app will help them to monitor the situation more closely.The �DengueFreeChild� app has been created with separate user access for government officials and school authorities, in addition to the general public use of sharing and accessing information about Dengue patients.�Dengue has become a critical national health issue, and as the National Mobile Service Provider, we had a responsibility to find ways to combat this disease,� says Isuru Dissanayake - Senior General Manager Marketing, Mobitel. �We are proud to collaborate with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the University of Colombo and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore to design and develop this timely and much-needed application. It gives us immense satisfaction to leverage on our specialized mobile technology to enhance the wellbeing of the children of our country.��The �DengueFreeChild� app is now available for free download by Android Users on Google Play Store.�						* Dailymirror.lk neither liable nor responsible for any information / contents published in this article",dengue

When the son worshiped his father, who was about to leave home, he might not have thought that it was the last time he would get to worship his dad. Shehan, who died of a sudden heart attack, was also denied of the opportunity to know that he had obtained many distinctions at A/Level Examination. The house where he lived is isolated today.� ��Among those who died recently was a son by the name Shalika Shehan. This child is said to have lived with much hopeAnother death� �Another �flower bud� named Dewindi, who lived under the parents care, had a similar tragedy. She studied in grade 5 in Thri/Padavipura Jayanthi Wewa School. The cartoon �hero� in a TV. Programme, that was shown on the TV, Influenced her to imitate this character and his actions. One such feat that repeated was binding a creeper around her neck. This resulted in the unfortunate death of tiny Dewindi. This is how she said goodbye to life at an unexpected moment.� �Small children are like flowers. Their small hearts are warmed with the love and affection they show for fauna and flora. Susith Nirmal who lived in Inuwila in Chilaw also died unexpectedly. He was a resident of Samindugama (an area spanning 40 acres), in Chilaw. He had gone to the jungle with the hope of catching parrots with an unknown person. This person has had the habit of visiting the village to pluck king coconuts. But, he was unable to fulfill his expectations of catching parrots which was child�s hobby. It is said that this boy had been sexually abused, the incident leading to his death. It was after several days that the boy�s remains were found. The remains of the boy were found in a jungle in Inuwila.� �Even before the flames of Susith�s funeral pyre died down the death of another child, this time a daughter, was recorded. The name of the deceased was Saheli Niwarthika. She was a grade four student and attended Buddhist Primary school in Dehiowita. She was very humble and obedient to her teachers. The children in her class had to walk on the coconut shells as part of an extra-curricular activity, prescribed in the syllabus. The children in this class were seen practicing this activity earnestly on the gravel-less ground. Therefore, it was a frequent sight for the teachers to see these kids practice.� �All of a sudden, small Saheli had collapsed on the ground while trying this exercise. In spite of the fact that Saheli was hospitalized by the teachers concerned, she died unexpectedly.� �The daughter, Madubhashini Buddhika Liyanage (16) was another student who faced an untimely tragedy as all others mentioned here. She studied in grade eleven in Udagama Maha Vidyalaya in Atabage in Gampola. She was a resident of Deniyagama area in Millagahamula in Gampola. She was well versed in music.� �She played the violin well and was a gifted singer. She also attended dancing classes with her classmates. She had dropped her head saying that she was having a severe headache. Despite being taken to the nearby rural hospital for treatment, her condition had worsened. She was admitted to the Gampola Hospital for further treatment as per the medical instructions, but her life could not be saved.� �However, it is clear that these deaths have left a clear message�for us.��Malnutrition also causes�untime deaths�According to Nutritionist, Harshani Meegaswatte, obesity has become an issue, especially among urban children. But, there are also children who suffer from malnutrition despite food being available at homes. Although some mothers give food to their children these diets aren�t balanced. Most children as a result don�t carry the proper weight for their age. The weight of some children are below average. Some children don�t have breakfast. Such children have their first meal during the interval.� �She added that it was not only child abuse, but malnutrition that has brought untimely deaths to children. These factors are the causes for their malnutrition, she emphasized.��it was not only child abuse, but malnutrition that has brought untimely deaths to children�",dengue
Lankan formulates mosquito repellent,"2018-03-26 00:03:25							0						 				678","Says it addresses all factors that attract mosquitoesTo repel the mosquitoes that spread dengue, filaria and malaria, an engineer has formulated a liquid.�This liquid is pleasant to smell as well as it is safe on the human body.� It will smell for only five minutes but it can repel mosquitoes for 12 to 14 hours,�� Eng. �Rakitha Brito said. �The liquid will not affect children or pregnant women,� he claimed.�I have taken so much of time and energy to do the research and analysed the solution for the problem.� The main cause mosquitoes get attracted to human body is breathing -the release of carbon dioxide and the rate of releasing carbon dioxide is more in pregnant women.����When exercising there will be more chemical reaction in the human body and it will release lactic acid during the session, so that mosquitoes will be attracted to it according to research.Alcohol also attracts mosquitoes,� he said.� ��All over the world, people are still working on a solution to this.� Yet, the sprays aren�t effective and there are many side effects. �Normally we can prevent mosquitoes by preventing dark coloured clothes.We should use yellow lights at home. We also could use Lavender and Maduruthalaa to repel mosquitoes.���I wanted to repel mosquitoes instead of killing them.

Vehicles of corruption From bicycles to  Benz cars,"2018-03-22 00:00:04							0						 				1896","Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe didn�t mince his words when addressing newly elected members to the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). He told them what is expected of them and what is not.�Save the city dwellers from dengue, resolve the garbage issue and keep the city clean,� he said. Now if any CMC member or indeed anyone elected to any local government authority had to have responsibilities outlined thus, it is sad.However, Wickremesinghe was just warming up, it seems. He quickly moved to what could also be called known-stuff but stuff that few talk about. Stuff related to corruption.�Don�t become politicians who search for luxuries after coming to the field as paupers,� he is quoted as having said.Obviously there are those born with the proverbial silver spoon. They came into politics in a Benz car and still drive around in such vehicles. Well, some have expanded a single Benz into a fleet. Cars are seen, bank accounts are notHe uses an apt analogy: �Some politicians own only a push bicycle when they come to politics but later obtain Benz cars. Don�t think of becoming such politicians.�He�s correct. We have seen how politicians grow, literally and metaphorically. The tale has been told and retold by cartoonists across many decades.�Cartoonists exaggerate for effect but in this case it�s fair depiction. Wickremesinghe has been spared and for good reason. He�s remained lean throughout his political life.Obviously there are those born with the proverbial silver spoon. They came into politics in a Benz car and still drive around in such vehicles. Well, some have expanded a single Benz into a fleet. Cars are seen, bank accounts are not.In any event, he has articulated a problem. He has not offered a solution, though.If telling people, �Aney, please don�t steal� worked, we wouldn�t need a commission to investigate allegations of bribery and corruption. Indeed, we wouldn�t need courts. Judges and lawyers would be out of work. It just doesn�t work that way and Wickremesinghe probably knows this.Now, we shouldn�t make too much of a cautionary note made by a party leader to greenhorn politicians. We should, on the other hand, talk about the problem which, sadly, neither Wickremesinghe nor his partner-in-governance President Maithripala Sirisena has done little about. Corruption.When Maithripala Sirisena announced that he would contest the presidency, former president Chandrika Kumaratunga said �he is the only one in the current regime who is not corrupt.�We don�t know what Sirisena�s first vehicle was nor what he purchased last nor how. Perhaps Wickremesinghe would know. That�s another matter.What we saw immediately after he won the election is Sirisena and Wickremesinghe with the obvious approval of Kumaratunga appointing to cabinet those who in their book were corrupt. That was the beginning and that�s not to say that those in the United National Party were squeaky clean. They most certainly were not!We don�t have to list all the wrongdoings of politicians in the ruling coalition. The term �bond scam� would do. There was scam and there was aiding and abetting. Wickremesinghe and Sirisena both know all about it. The first COPE report was scuttled by dissolving parliament.Arjuna Mahendran�s innocence was claimed, the man was defended. The Attorney-General helped by choosing who to attack; who not to. Those who were clearly under a cloud were bailed out with new positions.Clearly there are lots of loopholes and Wickremesinghe would know about most of them and also those who used these conveniences. Surely, it�s not only those in �other parties� who moved did the bike-to-Benz number?There are no easy plug-all-holes solutions. The institutional arrangement needs to be fixed. The human resources are clearly inadequate, inept and corrupt. Political interference continues to be a problem despite the 19th Amendment. The Ministry of Law and Order is being treated like a hot potato by the Government, with three ministers being in charge of the subject over the last two months.Don�t become politicians who search for luxuries after coming to the field as paupersMore than all this, there�s what could be called a cardinal principle in the matter of sanctioning and encouraging wrongdoing. This is how it goes, as was pointed out editorially in a different newspaper about six years ago: if the boss is corrupt, he/she gives a licence for corruption to everyone under him/her.If any person down the line is corrupt, it means that either the boss is corrupt or inept. Lots of hats there and people are more than welcome to pick them up.If we have come to a point where newly appointed representatives need to be told �Please don�t rob� we are in pretty bad shape.�One of the key issues and one which is either ignored or is unknown to the relevant persons is that the primary task of the elected is to represent and the make laws. They are legislators and not executives.However, the moment the pernicious �Decentralized Budget� was introduced (by a previous UNP government), each and every legislator got the opportunity to play executive in his/her electorate and in most cases without any consultation with other entities, political or administrative, authorized to handle development. When you execute at any point, you tend to forget the legislating function.When you have give people the license to cut corners and make bucks, it is silly to expect them to think of push bicycles and not Benz cars.If telling people, �Aney, please don�t steal� worked, we wouldn�t need a commission to investigate allegations of bribery and corruptionTo put it simply, when you take the village out of the hands of the villagers and put it in the pocket of the politician, you are facilitating Benz-dreams. Wickremesinghe is not doing anything of the sort, but he�s doing nothing to put things right.Asset declaration at arrival and departure is a must. A strong audit commission that can resist political interference is a must. Honesty and integrity are musts. It�s sad that we must mention these things to bicycle-to-Benz politicians.Here�s an exercise for the UNP leadership: conduct a quick survey under two broad headings, �First vehicle� and �Current vehicle�. What was it, how much did it cost, how did you find the money, why did you choose it as opposed to something else, are the questions that need to be asked. It�s something all party leaders can do, if they have the courage or the moral authority that is.Malinda Seneviratne is a freelance writer. malindasenevi@gmail.com. www.malindawords.blogspot.com",dengue

Also, she said she would strive towards bringing people of all races and religions in the city together. She said her task would be easier than her predecessors as she would be working with a UNP led central government. Ms Senanayake said the UNP has been able to get 29 women candidates elected to the CMC.National Organizer of the UNP Bikkhu Front Venerable Ambanpola Gnanaloka Thera said politicians who begin their career from the CMC should work for the party rather than working with individual people.

MAN�S INHUMANITY TO MAN,"2018-03-15 03:54:00							2						 				8598","�HOSPITAL HOAX!!!�There is no other country in the world where �MAN�S INHUMANITY TO MAN� is more explicit, more brazenly displayed, than in this BUDDHIST COUNTRY of ours!!!��The first HOAX is the Government promising FREE MEDICINE, FREE HOSPITALIZATION to its citizens.��If that were true, this land would be a paradise indeed. You are admitted FREE, unlike in the schools but God helps you once you get in. It is not the doctors but the nurses and attendants you have to beware of!!!��Apparently, according to their regulations, a patient who is very ill is allowed to keep someone to look after them, but that person has to stay where they are told to stay, not near their patient. When they check on the patient from time to time, they find to their horror that the patient has either vomited or passed urine or, in some cases, is even unconscious without anyone�s knowledge. WHY? WHY, because the caregiver is not anywhere near the patient and does not know what has happened.��BUT WAIT! There is an alternative, for sure, if you pay Rs. 1,500/- a day you can get an attendant from the hospital, an attendant who is never around but appears mysteriously during visiting hours only, to see how much money they can scrounge and also to get a share of whatever fruits or other items that have been brought for the patient.��Most of the time, whatever has been brought is stolen and either sold or taken to their homes.!! A glaring example of man�s inhumanity to man! Can a poor patient who is admitted to a General Hospital out of sheer necessity because they can�t afford to get into any other hospital, can they possibly pay 1,500/- a day for a special attendant???��IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, WHO CHECKS ALL THIS INHUMAN BEHAVIOUR? ARE ANY OF THE AUTHORITIES AWARE OR ARE THEY PART AND PARCEL OF IT? Don�t these VULTURES REALIZE THAT SITUATIONS COULD BE REVERSED IN NO TIME, THAT THEY COULD WELL BE THE PATIENT WHO NEEDS CARE AND THEY WILL HAVE NO ONE TO GIVE IT TO THEM?��That is not the only injustice meted out - the other horror is when it comes to MEDICINE!!! Medicine is prescribed but most often the unsuspecting patients are told that the medicine is not available and they have to get it from outside.��THE TRUTH IS THAT THE MEDICINE AT THE HOSPITAL IS SOLD AND THE POOR PATIENTS HAVE TO PAY AN ARM AND A LEG FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD GET FREE!!! WHO LOOKS INTO ALL THIS - WHO CARES ABOUT THE WORRIES AND AGONIES OF THE POOR PATIENTS???�DOES ANYONE CARE???���CANCER HOSPITAL�If you think the above is bad, wait till you hear this.��IT IS TRULY HORRENDOUS!!!��Having cancer in itself is horrendous but these inhuman vultures carry on as though they or their people are never going to be struck by cancer or any other terrible disease. After a patient has been operated they are asked to come back to the clinic twice a month to check on their progress.��The Sri Lankan vultures have found a way of cashing in on this also. When you go to the Cancer Hospital clinic you have to wait your turn to see the doctor and the wait is endless, BUT if you place Rs, 200/- in the Record Keeper�s filthy hand, your file miraculously appears at the top of the endless pile of files.��Here again, I ask, what are the authorities doing about this treachery??? The problem of medicine remains the same here as well, irrespective of the fact that these poor patients have a life-threatening illness and desperately need the medicine prescribed.��More often than not they are told the medicine is not available. Amazingly though the medicine IS available at the pharmacy next to the Cancer Hospital!!!��FREE EDUCATION, FREE HEALTH CARE??? - FREE WIFI, OH YES; WE GOT THAT, THE ONLY ONE THAT IS REALLY FREE!!����CHILDREN�S HOSPITAL�Surprisingly, the situation at the Children�s Hospital seems to be positive. However, the major drawback is the lack of space, especially when the country is faced with Dengue in �epidemic� proportions!!!��Three or four children are compelled to share one bed, which is not only uncomfortable for the children but totally unhygienic as well!!! There is a desperate need for another Children�s Hospital.��Instead of concentrating on putting up more high rises, the Government has not addressed the necessity of building another Children�s Hospital. We wonder why issues of national importance are always put on the back burner!!!���FATHER GRANFATHER RAPE CHILD�In today�s newspaper, we read that in Meetiyagoda, the father and grandfather no less, have BOTH raped a 7 �year-old girl!��This is the Buddhist country we live in, the country that condones such brutality, that allows these perverted swine to get away with such heinous acts of RAPE on THEIR INNOCENT CHILDREN!!!��WHY, WHY, WHY CAN�T WE BRING IN SOME REAL PUNISHMENT FOR THESE culprits INSTEAD OF JUST SENDING THEM TO JAIL??? WHY CAN�T WE DO WHAT THEY DO IN SAUDI ARABIA? DISMEMBER THEM!

NBTS seeks blood brothers!,"2018-03-08 01:53:16							0						 				842","Donating blood is a meritorious deed that helps save many lives. The National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), attached to the Ministry of Health, is a decentralized unit which is the sole supplier of blood and blood products to state hospitals, including private institutions registered under the Ministry of Health. The NBTS recently announced that there is an impending risk of going through a blood shortage from the period of January to April this year.� �According to NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa, approximately 400 to 450 thousand units of blood from voluntary blood donors are collected annually by the NBTS island wide. Any volunteer between the ages of 18 and 55 with a healthy body weight not less than 50 Kg can donate blood whereas in the case of a regular blood donor, the individual can donate blood up to the age of 60 years. Moreover, it is crucial to ensure that the donor is physically fit and is not under medication for any chronic illness or is not suffering from any disease or infection. It isn�t recommended for an individual to donate blood if he or she has traveled abroad within the past three months at the time of the blood donation. While a whole blood donor can donate blood every four months, it should be noted that platelet donors can donate blood after a two week interval.� ��Shortage of Blood�Expressing his views to the Daily Mirror, Director of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) Dr. Rukshan Bellana said that during the period between January and April, a blood shortage is experienced every year. He said that the situation could worsen in the event an election is held during the given period.����It is a usual phenomenon to experience a blood shortage between January and April annually. We experienced this shortage this year too. On top of that, we had the elections in February. During the election period, it is normal to witness a drop in the blood supply. This year, both these factors coincided,� Dr. Bellana stated.� ��If we don�t do anything about it, we will walk into a crisis by next month or April. We have carried out a massive campaign during the past two or three weeks through our blood bank networks,� he added.� �The NBTS has been instrumental in carrying out several effective blood donation campaigns throughout the country in a bid to raise awareness on the importance of donating blood while ensuring that the risk of an impending blood shortage would be countered via such an endeavour. Stating that the recent blood campaign that was held in Kaththankudi was a success, Dr. Bellana added that it was the first time in history that a blood donation campaign was held in Kaththankudi. The campaign attracted 600 donors and to date this has been the highest ever statistic associated with a blood donation campaign held in the Batticaloa District. The blood donation campaign at Kaththankudi was organized by a Senior Consultant of Classic Travels (Pvt) Ltd and social worker, Rizwan Hafiz in collaboration with the NBTS.� �We have carried out a massive campaign during the past two or three weeks through our blood bank networks�Among the donors, the majority were represented by the Muslim community. Among them there were also ladies with burkhas who volunteered to donate blood. Their participation has helped dispel recent rumors, that it is considered bad to donate blood according to their religious practice. We held a similar campaign last Saturday (Feb. 17) in the Batticaloa town with nearly 160 donors. Though this campaign didn�t attract a big crowd, it was nevertheless a record set for the Batticaloa region when considering statistics of the past couple of years.� ��So, we have stepped up the campaign activities and we are seeing some improvement. We are seeing how people are coming and extending support to this noble cause. Given the situation, I hope we might not run into a crisis, but we would have definitely experienced one if we had not acted in advance,� Dr. Bellana said.� �A successful blood donation campaign is often a joint endeavor of several groupsUpon inquiring about how Colombo has coped with the situation pertaining to an impending blood shortage, he said that Colombo is always the highest in terms of available blood donors since it is congested with the highest population. However, noting that the same could not be applied in the case of Batticaloa, Dr. Bellana said that this was one of the main reasons why a blood donation campaign was organized in the said region. Highlighting that the situation in Hambantota is very unsatisfactory at present, Dr. Bellana informed that the NBTS is planning to organize its next blood donation campaign in this town in the near future.� ��In the overall, we are doing well in certain regions and not so well in other regions. I don�t think Batticaloa will be a problem hereafter because we have had a good campaign here. Also, we have raised awareness among people and blood donation has been promoted among them.The blood donated by donors, free of charge, during the campaign is collected and stored. Then we issue this to the public and private sectors for medical reasons as per their needs,� he added.� ��Accidents and Traumas�Explaining that accidents and traumas make up a high number of cases which demand blood, he added that surgeries which are growing in numbers, and are an everyday occurrence, have a greater demand for blood supply. Thalassaemia and cancer patients also require blood very often.�Not so long ago, we used to supply a lot of blood to treat dengue patients. Now since the treatment patterns have changed, not much blood is required to treat dengue patients although earlier we had a huge demand in this aspect. The number of major diseases, surgeries and accidents has increased at present, which is why we need more blood. It should also be noted when you take the Sri Lankan community, O+ is the type of blood that is mostly available within the community. O-, AB- and AB+ blood groups are very rare in the public,� Dr.Bellana said.� ��Organizing a Blood Donation Campaign�To take part in this noble venture, it is important to know how to organize a blood donation campaign in one�s locality. Deemed to be a meritorious act, donating blood for those in need is indeed a good cause that would save many lives. Enlightening us on the procedure, NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa shared her views on the subject. She said that it would be ideal to arrange blood donation camps during the April festive season and that blood donors are most welcome to donate blood.� ��A successful blood donation campaign is often a joint endeavor of several groups comprising Government and non-government organizations, private institutions, friends and volunteer groups. It should be noted that at least 50 donors should take part in a week day donor campaign whereas a weekend donor campaign is expected to attract at least 100 donors. On the other hand, a volunteer can donate blood at the premises of National Blood Centre Narahenpita anytime between 8.00 am and 6.00 pm. This centre is open all 365 days of the year. Donors can also donate blood at any of the hospital based blood banks between 8.00 am and 4.00 pm,� Dr. Saranajeewa said.� �Among the donors, the majority were represented by the Muslim communityExplaining further on how to arrange a campaign, Dr. Saranajeewa said that the camp premise should be a familiar location to donors comprising sanitary facilities such as a washroom in addition to facilities such as parking space, clean and be a calm atmosphere. While laying emphasis that the NBTS doesn�t approve anyone except volunteers as donors, she further highlighted that organizers will be called for a meeting by respective blood bank networks prior to hosting the campaign to educate them on the procedures pertaining to organizing the event. The necessary equipment for blood transfusion would be provided by the NBTS.� ��Mass blood mobiles with the participation of 1000 to 3000 donors are generally conducted by the National Blood Centre and Cluster Centre blood banks since they have the required capacity. Additionally, the NBTS wishes to invite the public to celebrate their life events by organizing a blood donation campaign at the blood bank premises. Also, those who are willing to donate blood can register themselves at the NBTS, which maintains a donor registry. This is very useful for the NBTS in the event of an emergency, in which case the NBTS can call and request a registered donor to donate blood� added Dr. Saranajeewa.� � �",dengue

We have been able to maintain our steady growth momentum despite a considerable rise in claim settlements thanks to our strong fundamentals and prudent reinsurance structure. The year 2018 will be a year of change resulting from the divestment of the Non-Life business. We are optimistic that the opportunities arising from a singular focus on theLife Insurance business, coupled with the opportunity of rebuilding an efficient distribution system, will strengthen our presence in the Sri Lankan Life Insurance industry.�The total Consolidated Assets of the company grew by 15% YoY, standing at Rs. 36.848 billion at the end of the period under review with the investment portfolio accounting for Rs. 25.523 billion of this value. Prudent management of investments helped Janashakthi register Rs. 451 million or a 23% growth in investment income which propelled Other Revenue to Rs. 3.159 billion.The transaction between Janashakthi Insurance PLC and Allianz SE will yield a capital gain in the hands of Janashakthi Insurance PLC and it is expected that the Company would undertake a substantial share buyback as a means of transferring capital back into the hands of shareholders.

When blood refuses to clot,"2018-02-09 14:27:47							0						 				1877","�Blood is an essential life sustaining component in our bodies. Recall the last time you experienced a cut or injury to your body. It would most likely have been a small� wound. Remember how the blood initially discharged fast, then slowed down and stopped completely. All this happened during a short span of a few minutes. Our bodies have mechanisms to keep the blood from leaking out of the vessels. But there are certain conditions where this mechanism fails and even a small wound could be fatal. These conditions are called bleeding disorders. Today in Health Capsule, we present an interview done with Dr.K.A.C Wickramaratne, Consultant Haematologist and Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine, Karapitiya, during which he spoke at length when answering questions about bleeding disorders.��Q What is Haemostasis?� �In order to carry out its functions optimally, blood should be maintained as a fluid inside the vessel and should clot immediately if the vessel is damaged. If blood form solid �clots� inside blood vessels, it may lead to death of the patient. In such instances death will come in the form of a heart attack or a brain attack. On the other hand, when a blood vessel is damaged bleeding has to stop immediately which happens as a result of the forming of a blood clot at the site of injury. If this doesn�t happen the person would bleed out. There should be a delicate balance between the two because a slight tip of balance either way could be fatal. This process is called haemostasis.� �Q How does a wound stop bleeding following an injury?� �Clotting of blood after a vessel is damaged is a complex process with the participation of multiple factors. To make a long story short, von Willebrand factor (vWF), a special protein in blood, binds to a protein called collagen in the damaged site. This makes way for platelets, the small disc like particles in the blood to come and bind at the site, which then attracts more platelets to the site. So, a blood clot is formed, blocking the leaking of blood.� �To make the platelet plug solid and retainable, a crisscrossing meshwork of fibrin is formed as a result of a cascade activating a series of proteins in plasma, called coagulation proteins. This process, called coagulation, stops the bleeding completely, anchoring the platelet clump. The final process looks after the healing of the wound, which includes the gradual breakage of the anchoring meshwork that is replaced by vessel wall tissues.� �Q What happens during a bleeding disorder?� �A bleeding disorder is any problem in the factors or components required for the complete clot formation. That includes platelets, von Willebrand factor, collagen and all the coagulation factors.� ��These can have two problems; reduced concentration below the required levels and the defective function of the factor.� �These diseases are commonly acquired due to diseases in the body. E.g.: platelets are reduced when dengue fever is present. Coagulation proteins reduce to levels below normal. This condition occurs during liver disease such as cirrhosis. When these components are not adequate or not working appropriately, people experience bleeding disorders. Some of these conditions are acquired in later life or may be coming from generations down as l (inherited) diseases. Low platelets can also be seen with blood cancers or related diseases. The platelet function can also be inhibited by drugs taken for heart attacks such as apirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole etc.� �Q How do these patients present?� �The patients present with excessive and unusual bleeding, including heavy bleeding from a minor injury or during some instances spontaneous. They may complain of bleeding on the skin with no trauma or unusual blood stains in saliva, blood in urine, nose bleeds etc. Women can have heavy periods; a condition called menorrhagia.� �When platelets or vWF is present in blood� in very low amounts or if these are defective, bleeding occurs mainly into the skin and mucosa. Dot like bleeding patches, bleeding from gums, nasal bleeding, big patches of bleeding spots and profuse bleeding following trauma are common in these patients.� �When coagulation factors are defective or less, bleeding usually occurs some time after. This type of bleeding is seen as bleeding into joints (haemarthrosis) or big bleeds into muscles (haematoma).� �A typical story in many patients with this condition is heavy bleeding following a tooth extraction. If the bleeding is immediate it is most likely due to a problem in platelets or vWF. If there was no bleeding issue after extraction and if the patient starts bleeding some times later, this is usually a problem in coagulation factors.� ��Q What are the common bleeding disorders seen today?� �Von Willebrand DiseaseThis is the commonest out of all the bleeding disorders, with one in hundred individuals having the disease. It is inherited and may go unnoticed as �something normal� in the family; specially among females. For instance the women in these families tend to have heavier menstrual periods than normal.� �Haemophilia�This is a very rare disease, with only around 2000 patients being present in all of Sri Lanka. Haemophilia occurs due to a deficiency of some coagulation factors. Commonly it is the deficiency of factor VIII or IX (different factors are named with roman letters). This disease is transmitted from genes; ex: mother to son. Females generally do not have main disease. Therefore, maternal uncles with bleeding problem could be indicative of haemophilia. These patients can present at toddler age, with bleeding into joints when trying to stand.� �Q� How do you treat patients with bleeding disorders?� �Patient education on various bleeding patterns is vital during treatment.� �Coagulation defects such as haemophilia can be treated by giving periodic injections. Nowadays patients are trained to receive injections at home. In main hospitals haematologists have established haemophilia day centres to provide better care for such patients. These patients should be advised to avoid contact sports and to keep away from risky behaviours.� �Platelet problems demand proper identification of the underlying disease. Steroids may be prescribed during some immune diseases.� �They should not take Aspririn or related drugs without proper consultation of a doctor due to the risk of bleeding. They should always alert the doctor about their condition whenever they seek medical care.� �",dengue
Will transform country into a paradise: MR,"2018-02-08 01:40:55							36						 				9418","Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, who spearheaded the Local Government election campaign of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), yesterday claimed that they had a plan to transform the country into a paradise if the SLPP wins the February 10 local government elections.Addressing the final election rally of the SLPP held in Homagama last night, Mr. Rajapaksa said they have already shown what they are capable of by putting an end to a 30-year war within a short period of 3 years.""I invite people to have faith in us. People already know the development projects we have carried out to uplift the country. Today, no such development is taking place. During my visit to Jaffna recently, residents complained that not even a culvert had been dug by this government.

Vote for the party you think will protect your rights as a citizen : Eran Wickramaratne,"2018-02-06 14:41:22							2						 				1724","The local government election has been marked as an important day in the political calendar. With many promises and plans, candidates both senior and amateur have started working for the people. Finance State Minister EranWickramaratne is positive about the changes that have taken place after the present government was elected to office. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Eran shared his thoughts about the challenges faced by the economy during the previous years while encouraging the people to use their vote wisely at the upcoming election.Excerpts :�� �Q: Colombo is a UNP stronghold. How confident are you that the UNP will win this time?A: When talking about an election, we need to look at the team as well as their manifesto. Since there�s a new law for the local government election there are suitable candidates nominated in other districts as well. Especially there�s a 25% presentation for women as well. The UNP has put forward a formidable team in Colombo led by Rosy Senanayake. Sri Lanka will have its first elected female mayor. Rosy is an experienced politician and she even served as the Ambassador for Malaysia. The work she has done in Sri Lanka and overseas has been commended by many people. She has a formidable team of professionals supporting her for the upcoming election. Teamwork is an absolute must in delivering results. The manifesto presented by Rosy Senanayake has highlighted on many services. A year and a half ago, this government decidedto have an ambulance service and many people criticized it from time to time. We rolled out this service in the districts of Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Colombo,Gampaha and Kalutara. One year after, the results were amazing. In less than 13 minutes, when you call 1990, an ambulance turns up at your doorstep or wherever the accident has taken place. This is how technology has been used to make services more efficient. Rosy Senanayake will make use of technology to make services more efficient within the municipality by introducing a service centre. In addition to that the city has many problems. Urban renewal programmes are needed. When you put up buildings you need to make sure that they adhere to the law and therefore the zoning has to be done properly. In addition to that there are other services that the citizens require. You need a clean environment, you need your garbage to be collected on time, you need your drains to be cleared and you need to fight the dengue menace. She has plans for these. In addition to that she is also planning to bring in vocational training facilities for the residents of Colombo in order upscale the income in lower income areas. Therefore the UNP has the people and the plan and therefore I urge you to vote for the UNP. If there are five votes at your home, it would be imperative that you use all five votes because this election is not only about electing your local member; it�s also about getting a majority. Even though there are no preferential votes, this is a proportional representation election, therefore every vote counts.�Q :One of the major accusations from the Opposition is that the present government couldn�t bring in Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) as promised in 2015. But in 2016 a larger number of FDIs were brought in. What are your comments?A : When we took over reins of government in January 2015 this country was facing a crisis. There is a huge debt burden and this has increased over the last period. Our debt has increased and our foreign currency debt has increased. In addition to that we have replaced concessional debt with commercial debt so the entire debt profile has increased. The former government maintained an artificial Rupee-Dollar rate and when you maintain such a Rupee-Dollar rate you always understate your debt. When you free your currency to the market rate exchange rate naturally the real debt is reflected in rupees. So the increase in debt during this period has more to do with the currency being a free market currency than our government borrowing. This is the economy we inherited. The first two and a half years has gone to stabilize the economy. By freeing the exchange rate we have also been able to give exporters a wonderful opportunity to compete with the real world. In the past period under the SLFP-led government exports which were more than 30% of GDP had come down gradually to 14% of GDP. Exports are needed if we want to keep our living standards rising. So we have freed the exchange rate and therefore exports are rising too. Exports have increased in the past year by nearly 10% and this is a wonderful sign. GSP Plus has been achieved after our new government took office. Its benefits will be seen over the 2018-2019 period. Also there was a ban from the European Union on fishing exports from Sri Lanka which too has been lifted. This year alone fishing exports have increased by 39%. Confidence has returned. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is able to target inflation the old nexus between the government and the CBSL during the previous period has been broken. FDIs from USD 750 million during the last year has more than doubled to USD 1.8 billion in 2017. I think 2017 has been the watershed year and we are going to see the benefits in managing the economy prudently in 2018 and 2019. More investments, more jobs, more exports and rising living standards will be seen.Q: As a senior politician, what is your message to all UNP supporters in view of the upcoming election?A: On February 10, we have an opportunity to vote in our local governments across the country. Voting is an important right that the citizens have. We need to use that vote to protect democracy. On January 8, 2015 the citizens of this country voted for a change. That was a big change. We know that just a week ago, the President of this country went to the Supreme Court and asked a question; �Do I have five years or six years to govern?� The SC unanimously gave a verdict on that question and said that he has only five years. It�s very much different to the past. In the past if a question like that was asked in the SC they may have hesitated. But now the court is independent. The decisions are made based on the principles of law. The reason why I say this is because it wasn�t long ago when the Chief Justice of this country was kicked out of her office by the executive using the Parliament as an instrument. That is one of the darkest moments in our history. We have reinstated the independence of the judiciary and through the 19A we have strengthened the rights and position of the citizens. We brought in a new act giving citizens a Right to Information. You can use this right. As you elect your members you can go and find out how money was spent, what were it spent on and the quality of the investments and expenditures that they were doing. Citizens in Europe had this right over 200 years ago and citizens in South Asia had it more recently. But our citizens didn�t have this right until our government was voted in. Remember that in this election, when you discharge your civic responsibility you are voting to protect democracy. There may be shortcomings in our government but it has stood strongly for democracy and justice. The process may be slow and you may be disappointed sometimes that the outcomes haven�t come in the way you expected. But I can tell this for sure; we are on the right track and we are at the beginning of this journey and once we continue down this road, we will be the beneficiaries of a better society.

Contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) from the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Karuppiah Ramakrishnan representing the Kirula Ward has a vision to work towards transparency in politics. Having completed his degree in media at the University of Sri Jayawardanapura, Ramakrishnan has over 10 years of work experience as a sports journalist and has contributed to a leading English newspaper in the country. Speaking to the Daily mirror� , Ramakrishnan shared his plans for Colombo and its people.� �QWhy did you want to enter politics?�For me politics is a volunteer service. I have been involved in Rotaract and other youth activities and have always worked for the community. People join politics to earn more bucks and this is where they go wrong. Our party led by Mano Ganesan has produced two cabinet ministers and one state minister. At the provincial council level we have 16 members. We�re a strong party supporting the Tamil population and as a youngster I wanted to be involved in it to make a change.� �QHow challenging is the new electoral system for newcomers?�It is very easy to work under the new system. Each representative has to look after his or her particular ward. If the people vote for the correct person he or she will make sure that the people are very well represented. Now they don�t have to go collecting a higher number of votes from each city to win an entire electorate. Nobody can have his or her own way with this system and that is another positive. We can all work independently for the benefit of the people.� �QThere are many Tamil people in Colombo. As a minority what major issues do they face?�Issues in Colombo are common to all its people. Although we talk about just four lakhs of people in Colombo we need to consider upgrading the infrastructure facilities to benefit people visiting Colombo on a daily basis. The CMC should set an example to the rest of the municipal councils, but there has been very little progress over the past years. Dengue is another issue we need to concentrate on. I don�t remember the CMC being represented by a Tamil mayor during the past few decades. I remember that just after we received independence, a Tamil mayor was elected to office for a brief 10 months. Why has it happened that way? Therefore there�s a nationalist issue here. The CMC has 16 Montessori facilities that accommodate children of low income families. But they are conducted in Sinhala medium and it�s a challenge for Tamil children. Therefore such issues need to be looked at using a more holistic approach which will benefit everyone.� ��Now they don�t have to go collecting a higher number of votes from each city to win an entire electorate. Nobody can have his or her own way with this system and that is another positive. We can all work independently for the benefit of the people.� ��QWhat are your plans for Colombo?�Dengue is one of the major issues. The only solution for dengue is fumigation which is bad for the environment. It not only kills the mosquitoes, but it disrupts the food cycle as well. Therefore it�s not a practical solution. We need to encourage people to stay clean and make sure that their gardens are properly maintained. That way this issue could be solved. Other countries don�t carry out fumigation to control the mosquito issue. If not for the British, the CMC wouldn�t even have had a building today. The UNP was in power for 60 years and what have they done?� �Another issue is that the CMC introduced an e-Tax Online Payment system. But this system could be extended to other services as well. Therefore technology could be effectively used to make it more efficient.� �Traffic needs to be controlled immediately. If the CMC puts in more thought to control traffic they could use a GPS system to indicate those entering Colombo where there is more traffic. It could be like a digital guide to Colombo showing people where they could find a washroom facility, a caf� and other places they would wish to visit. When we walk along Rajakeeya Mawatha, the environment is different to that in Maligawatte. Why couldn�t we plant more trees in Colombo? People in underserved developments live with minimum facilities. Some even don�t have space to pull up a clothing line and instead use a current wire to hang their wet clothes. This is the sad side of Colombo which we as a party will focus on.� �QPeople have the tendency to abstain from voting as they claim that the system is corrupt. What is your message to them?�If you exercise your voting rights during this election, you can elect someone who will work for your ward. Therefore people need to vote wisely. When these candidates go canvassing people can always ask for their educational qualifications and professional background, that way people can be sure about their vote. This is not the old system and therefore they do not have to worry. People have the power this time.� �",dengue

Contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward is Roshnie De Saram under the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket. Roshnie is a proud pupil of Visakha Vidyalaya and sports a qualification in Business and Management from Australia. Belonging to a post-independence lineage of politicians, Roshnie has always been interested to serve the less fortunate.� If elected, Roshnie has big plans for Colombo and she shared her views about the upcoming polls during an interview with the Daily mirror .�QWhy did you decide to contest this time?� �We need to bring the country back to its former state and it is Mahinda Rajapakse who can do that. I initially supported the UNP, but I want to see change happen and therefore I decided to contest for the first time at the upcoming Local Government Elections.� �QThose with professional backgrounds are seldom found in parliament. What are your views on this?� �I think it�s very important that individuals with a professional background are involved in politics. Otherwise this country cannot function with people who have a lower level of education.��QColombo has many issues which were promised to be solved. The low-income households are one aspect. Is it right for politicians to make more promises to these people and in turn do nothing?� �They are living under very poor conditions. Their bathrooms and other sanitary facilities need to be upgraded immediately. I think we should give them a hand to uplift their lifestyles.� �QWhat are your plans for Colombo?� �If I�m elected to office I will make some big changes for the benefit of my people. Some of my plans include building houses for those with special needs, eradicating dengue through efficient smoke treatment, implementing a central hotline system for prompt action to be taken; appoint committees consisting of residents, businessmen, environmentalists and professionals to be the voice of each ward. I�m also planning to have a city with an uninterrupted renewable energy system and an efficient health division for regulating food outlets and health services.� �QWomen were virtually neglected in the political scene for a long time. What changes do you like to see happening with the introduction of the 25% quota for women?� ��I think it is one of the best decisions that was ever taken. Women do a lot of multi-tasking and we understand the requirements of every mother and sister. We need more women to be involved in the decision-making process. Mothers run the homes and their livelihoods need to be improved.� �QHow important is it to implement infrastructure facilities to make the city user-friendly for differently abled people?� �It definitely is a major requirement. When I visited the Wadiya I saw a boy who was begging. He was bent so badly and had no mother or father to look after him. They too need to live with dignity. It is important that they are given a proper place to stay in. They could be involved in self-employed businesses such as the incense industry. Their skills and talents such as artwork and handwork could be highlighted as well. So we need to start community centres as means of empowering them.��QPeople expected a change on January 8. Three years down the line what has the present Government achieved?� �Nothing is happening today. Businesses could be improved, charity could be done, but we don�t see anything happening today. We have done our part to help the people, but they aren�t even bothered. I have helped people in my capacity, but today�s cost of living is so high. What we did for Rs. 75,000 back in the day exceeds the Rs. 100,000 limit today. Therefore it�s time to make a wise decision.� �QColombo is known to be a UNP stronghold. How will you take up this challenge by contesting from the Pohottuwa?� �People say that they are born UNPers. There are educated people making similar statements, but what have they got? I think they are only thinking about themselves and not of the rest of the citizens. Why can�t we change their mindsets? The former President loved the country and had a vision for it. I hope that we will be able to make a change this time.� �Q What is your message to the people?� �Don�t be selfish. I want to ask people to wake up and vote for what is right. Everyone is dreaming as they are being given big promises. We need to transform Colombo into a sustainable city. In order to do that, people need to be wise in taking their decisions.� �����",dengue

It was an uncle of mine who formed the Podujana Party in which I was a member. But I wasn�t involved in party politics. However I have been following the political history and as professionals we needed a party to represent the people. Then in April 2005 a few of us got together and formed the Podujana Professional Group with about nine members. Then during the previous general elections we thought of going in as an independent group and the United National Freedom Front (UNFF) was formed as the 70th political party of the country.

These include the dengue problem which has caused many issues in the area. The other issue is the garbage problem which will be effectively controlled to make Nawala a beautiful city. Workplace corruption is another issue that we as a party are focusing on.

Now nobody can cross the road as well. Flyovers are not an effective solution to curb traffic.� �How challenging is it to contest as a new comer of a new political party?��There are 1221 houses in this ward and I have managed to visit almost all the houses. Many voters are disgusted by this system and some are wondering whether to vote or not. I have spent time talking to them and encouraging them to use their franchise wisely.

Rains increase threat of Dengue outbreak,"2018-02-02 21:05:43							5						 				5346","The intermittent rains experienced in many parts of the country right now has increased the threat of a dengue outbreak, while the number of dengue cases reported in the first five weeks of 2018 stood at 6,203 by today, with five deaths.The Government Epidemiology Unit (GEU) announced today that during the last 12 months of the year 2017, 184,442 suspected dengue cases have been reported to the Epidemiology Unit throughout the island.Approximately 41.53% of dengue cases were reported from the Western province. The GEU said this situation warrants regular removal of possible mosquito breeding sites from the environment and it is important to seek medical attention in the event of fever by day three of the illness.Meanwhile, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the Health Ministry would do its utmost to prevent a dengue outbreak, though the year 2018 has been identified as a dengue epidemic year, and added that it was common that a dengue epidemic has been experienced once in every two years in the last couple of decades.�We have used so many chemical, biological and traditional methods to control dengue with limited success. For instance the use of BTI (Bacillus Thuringiensis Israelensis), vaccine and fumigation did not bring desired results. We have now decided to introduce a natural bacteria species Wolbachia that would control transmitting dengue virus by mosquitoes to humans with foreign assistance, Minister Senaratne said.He said the Ministry of Health will enter into a �Collaboration Agreement� with the University of Monash, Australia under the World Mosquito Programme, on the implementation of the proposed Wolbachia Project in selected areas of the Colombo District endemic for dengue, at a cost of A$ 1 million (Rs. 120 million).�Aedes aegypti� is the main vector for dengue in Sri Lanka. Vector control is the main strategy to control the spread of the disease. However, traditional vector control strategies have so far failed to curb the increasing incidence and therefore the disease has now become a key threat.�Use of �Wolbachia� bacterium to block the transmission of dengue virus is a novel control strategy introduced by scientists of Monash University, Australia. This bacterium is found naturally inside bodies of more than 60% of insect species, including some mosquito species in the world. ,� the Minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)",dengue
The municipality cannot function without the central government : Rosy Senanayake,"2018-02-01 11:05:13							8						 				6867","UNP Mayoral candidate Rosy Senanayake is gearing up for the upcoming poll. Making a change in the political landscape, if elected to office, Rosy will be the first female mayor of Colombo. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Rosy spoke about a few serious concerns at hand and her future plans for the city.Q: There were various projects in your manifesto. Are such similar projects done in other countries as well?A: Yes, garbage is a classic example because in every other country garbage is a treasure. Garbage can be converted to energy and it has various other uses as well. So we are looking at finding a permanent solution for the garbage dump. In all honesty and fairness we need to understand that the previous government didn�t have a solution for this garbage issue. I have been complaining about the health hazard but they didn�t consider the repercussions of dumping it in Meethotamulla. They didn�t know what to do with the garbage because it can be categorized in to various types such as perishable, non-perishable, clinical etc. Every type of garbage could be used for various purposes and it is a money spinner as well. We are now looking at waste-to-energy projects. The Prime Minister has now found a permanent dumping place in Puttalam. We can also have a few incinerators within the city and dispose the garbage.Q: A similar issue like the garbage problem is the condominium bubble that�s coming up. Do you have plans to bring in regulations for these constructions?A: Definitely there has to be regulations because I don�t think the city can hold so many constructions. There are many illegal constructions coming up which will be a hazard. Even these waste water lines are very archaic. The population too has increased but we don�t have the capacity yet to serve the people in those areas. We are giving out a 10-year plan where we will be improving the infrastructure with regard to sewage lines, wastage lines etc which will be done in stages. Housing is one of the prime areas that I will be looking at. Proper sanitation and toilet facilities are areas which we will thoroughly concentrate on. For the past 25 years we couldn�t do much in the city simply because the central government was not from the party. Colombo has been a UNP stronghold and it is our heart but we have received step-motherly treatment.Q: Projects such as the Independence Arcade and the Floating Market incurred losses. How will you make them profitable ventures?A: There are ways and means in making a project profitable. There are many aspects we need to focus on, one being that of women. There are women who work as domestic aides since they need to earn a living. But we need to look at empowering them and allow them to stand on their own feet. Finance is a big issue because even for a woman to start her own catering business, she needs money to make it happen. It is important that we strengthen the livelihoods of women especially in the Colombo city limits. In my manifesto I have promised to have 25 community centers in areas where the municipality�s services are needed. We can start a Grameen banking system where women can get collaterals and other benefits when they face certain difficulties in life. We also need to focus on children because what happens today is that they just go to school and even if they fail or not they end up riding a three-wheeler. . But they need to be trained to take on basic challenges in life. There will be three vocational training centers for the youth thereby addressing the unemployment issue as well.Q: Poor conditions of the road network is a complain all citizens have. How will you upgrade them?A: That is another key area that we are focusing on. The municipality cannot function without the central government. They cannot carry out some of their projects without the municipality. So it�s a two-way system. There will be a flyover project, underground transport and canal transport as well. We are planning some mega projects with the Megapolis Ministry. We will take the services to the people. So the people have to come to the Colombo municipality and get their work done. But this time the service will be made more efficient so that they don�t have to pay repeated visits to get one job done. They complain that they have to bribe somebody to get things done. Bribery and corruption will totally be eradicated. Dengue is one of the biggest hazards that we have faced. If the city is clean and the water is flowing; if we have smart sewage lines and other technology we will be able to eradicate the dengue mosquito. On the other hand participatory citizens are a must and I will be having townhall meetings to listen to the likes, grievances and suggestions of people.Q: How confident are you that you will win?A: I�m very confident about my win. Colombo municipality is untouchable we have never lost. I want to win so that I don�t have to draw an alliance with somebody else. I have a team of professionals who can help us to deliver at the end of the day. I also want to encourage the general public to be a part of the system.",dengue
GOvt. has shown they aren�t  capable of delivering -Sharmila Gonawela,"2018-02-01 00:06:44							1						 				4859","�The battle for Local Government Elections is heating up. An election should benefit the people, irrespective of symbols like the Pohottuwas, Beetle leaves or Elephants through which they come into power. Several decades down the line, people are still hoping for a better country. Sharmila Gonawela is contesting from the Bambalapitiya Ward for the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) under the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket.�Speaking to the�Dailymirror, Gonawela spoke about the challenges she faced being a Municipal Councillor back in 2002 and what she is planning to do if elected.� �Excerpts :� �QYou were a member of the CMC before. What made you contest again?��I was a member back in 2002 and I won under the UNP ticket. I was the only woman sitting with 52 other men. I have fought corruption and malpractices, but I never got the support that I needed from the party. Thereafter I went to the Bribery Commission, the CID and other Presidential Commissions with documentation to complain about all these issues. Eventually I stepped down from politics after four years. But in 2010 after the war concluded I voted for Mahinda because I thought it was the duty of all Sri Lankans. He invited me this time and I therefore decided to contest under the SLPP ticket.� ��If I can be the Mayor of Colombo who has worked for the city after 60 years, who has built up a greener, healthier and an IT-friendly city and if people say that all this was done by a woman, I would be the happiest. I�m also sure that I can be that person as well�QBack in 2002, women were rarely involved in the political scene when compared to the present time. What challenges did you face�back then?��There were some men who were very supportive. But when I went in I was the only woman sitting there. Some would bring in bottles and get drunk at official meetings and then I requested for a private area. I even refused to use the toilets there because they were in a row with just one door. Although I requested for a separate room, neither the party nor the councilors backed me. They feared that I would get more power if I went in to a separate room. So my requests were more often than not, turned down.� ��QWhat are your views on operationalizing the 25% quota for women in politics?��It�s an excellent move. Women have to be encouraged to be in politics. They are more sensitive towards issues and we also want to change the political culture. We need to be more transparent and ensure a corruption-free society. We have 5% of Parliamentarians who are women, but what have they really spoken about? There was an issue of a 14-year-old girl who was raped in Down South and she then took her life. We also have the incident where the Uva Province Chief Minister made a teacher kneel down. But has any female Parliamentarian made any statement with regard to these issues? When my opponent candidate Rosy was in the Women�s and Children�s Affairs ministry, there was a complaint made regarding the rape of an underaged girl by a powerful cabinet minister�s son. But was any action taken? With regard to the Bond Issue, Rosy was in the COPE committee and during the 100 days inquiry a vote was called for and she didn�t come and vote. The son was accused of it. But she went and sat with Sujeewa Senasinghe when he launched the book. So aiding and abetting is equal to being corrupt.���QHow challenging is the political game today with the implementation of the Mixed Electoral System?��I�m on the National List and looking after the Bambalapitiya Ward. Just because women�s representation was increased, if the number of councillors is being increased from 53 to 113, we are still placing the burden on the people. As at now, we don�t see any service being rendered to the people. We are adding to the 53 who are already available, so it�s the rate payer who will be deprived of their services which they should be getting. I feel it�s not very practical. With the increase the general council meetings have been shifted elsewhere and Rs. 25 lakhs is being charged per sitting. In addition to that the existing members� room is being renovated to accommodate 113 members, but what if this system is a failure? What will they do with 113 seats?���I must say that I have received good feedback, especially from Muslim ladies. People in Colombo have come to realise that they get nothing out of the rates they have been paying for 60 long years. The Government has shown that they aren�t capable of delivering anything. I feel that there�s a big swing�QWhat are your plans for Colombo?��In 2003 I spoke of a greener Colombo. I also spoke of a separate bus line for women in the city. We need to implement these things. Also with regard to the traffic congestion in Colombo we can only talk of sky trains and a good city bus service run by the private sector. The transport system comes under the Central Government and the city bus service is the only thing we can depend on. Garbage is another issue. Way back we had the �Kunu mola watte� in Kirulapona and Central Colombo. Garbage was brought here and burnt. Today this �Kunu mola watte� is called Nagaswatte and has been turned into a low-income housing area. People made a living at �Kunu mola watte� by segregating plastic, cardboard and other materials which were eventually sold. The segregation was done free-of-charge because people had an interest in collecting them. This has come to a halt as well.� �It was the UNP that led the CMC for 60 years. During those 60 years they had no plan. Of course Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had a good plan for garbage, but as they came in, it was stopped due to political reasons. But I believe that we have to stop thinking politically and look at result-oriented approaches for the people. If they continued what Gota started, people would have said this is Gota�s project, but this garbage problem wouldn�t have emerged today. Dengue is another result of this garbage problem. The rate payer pays rates for garbage collection and disposal. If the council has no proper plan for garbage they also cannot penalise the rate payer. Today we have over 100 engineers in the Council and we privatise garbage collection and disposal.� �The low-income houses are another aspect I�m considering. If every district has officials looking after the area, then under whose advice or assistance do these unauthorised structures come up daily? It�s all politically motivated. If you are from a low income family I would encourage you to build a separate house because I�m sure of your vote. But after a few years you need to be fed, provided with basic amenities such as roofing sheets and also with �pin padi� (A dole) � which is received by 13,000 people in the city. This is just a political hub of one party and the rate payers are maintaining Colombo for this party to win.� ��QDoes it mean that the UNP has not found any practical solution for the past 60 years?��Yes. I�m directly challenging the party�s Mayoral Candidate. She is talking about a greener Colombo, but her answer to mitigate the mosquito menace is to cut down huge trees. Who would have a heart to cut trees? How can you run a city like that? We have 13,000 people receiving �pin padi� so can�t we get them to plant a tree each? We also have maternity centres and medicine clinics. We also have one laboratory and Ayurveda clinic as well in addition to all the staff that is required. If we can strengthen these establishments I�m sure we can stop the traffic congestion near the general hospitals. We have the money and the infrastructure, but the priority has been on politically�motivated issues.� ��QBut the majority of the people have always supported the UNP. Do you still think that after all these years, they would vote for the your party this time?��It was a UNP hub. But in my area I have walked into every house unlike my opponent candidate who goes round throwing leaflets into every house.The response has been very good. The UNP was confident that the minorities were with them. I must say that I have received good feedback, especially from Muslim ladies. People in Colombo have come to realise that they get nothing out of the rates they have been paying for 60 long years. The Government has shown that they aren�t capable of delivering anything. I feel that there�s a big swing.� �QThe past regime carried out various city beautification projects and they appeared to be practical in front of the citizens. But why do you think people voted for the present regime instead?��I wasn�t politically involved when it happened, but I believe that they trusted a lot of wrong people. I think Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR) didn�t take appropriate actions when he had to take them. The correct message wasn�t conveyed to him, at times.� ��QAs you said earlier, you have voiced out on corruption and malpractices. The present regime has appointed various commissions to probe into these matters. What are your views?��The Government appointed commissions one month before the elections. Thajudeen or Lasantha cannot be brought back. They started investigations, but it was stuck somewhere. The people who were rumoured to be involved in these cases were never questioned to begin with. MR and Namal were accused of having accounts in Dubai and so on. So why can�t they question the accused? The opposition now has enough evidence to probe into corrupt practices that have been taking place for the past three years.� ��QHow confident are you that you will win?��I�m 100% confident. I�m challenging my opponent and I�m going to defeat her in her own Ward. If she doesn�t win her own Ward she can�t be Mayor. I as a woman I would like to be a woman Mayor of Colombo, but I wouldn�t just want to be the first woman Mayor of Colombo. If I can be the Mayor of Colombo who has worked for the city after 60 years, who has built up a greener, healthier and an IT-friendly city and if people say that all this was done by a woman, I would be the happiest. I�m also sure that I can be that person as well. I strongly feel that a Mayor is not just an administrator. We have a staff comprising highly educated engineers and also those people who collect garbage. We have a very strong political wing which is represented by different political parties. The Mayor has to be someone who is good in administration and also someone who has a political background.",dengue

As the Tourism Minister, it is my hope and prayer that there be many more hotels that will come up in order to meet the demand of tourists coming into Sri Lanka.�By the end of last year, we ended up with over two million tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka, which was despite all the obstacles that we have had, which is the closure of the airport, the climatic conditions that we had - floods and cyclones and finally, the dengue epidemic. All that is gone now and with all that we achieved this amount of tourist arrivals,� stated Amaratunga.�Now we are in 2018. Our target is around 2.5 million or more. God bless that there will be no more epidemics or obstacles that will come to Sri Lanka during this period. Now in this context, you will see that last year we earned US $ 3.9 billion, which is just an approximate amount that we have received. So this year, we will see that that the government will have an income of nearly US $ 4 billion. Now that is what this government is expecting from tourism,��Amaratunga added.Within its portfolio, Amagi Hotels houses two distinctive properties � Amagi Aria in Negombo and Amagi Beach in Marawila. Amagi Hotels debuts on a new venture with the rebranding of its Negombo property with the �Aria� brand that significantly caters along the positioning of a value-based hotel in the four-star market�in Negombo.�",dengue
Who plays to the gallery?,"2018-01-29 00:06:29							2						 				2385","Proposal for free tabs for 200,000 A/L students			Despite odds, unity government was able to maintain the economic stability			People�s mandate made Ranil PM with a record 500,000 votes�			President�s recent comment comes purely as a political stunt	No sooner than later there will be a Sri Lankan version to the book �Fire and Fury� which has sold millions of copies in USA. When you read and hear the comments made by the President Maithripala Sirisena during the last few days there is no doubt that someone who was instrumental in making him President may pen the paper against the philosophy of what the President stood for before being elected and until recently.��To the surprise of all, the President went on rampage a few days ago blaming the UNP for mishandling the economy during the last two years and therefore he will begin to lead it from this year. This means that he will either take over the responsibilities of the Finance Minister or will create an institution above the Finance Ministry or veto his powers to the extent that he controls the subject economy.� �However by looking at the calibre of people he has in his camp, he may not be able to handle by himself but to get assistance from the UNP again.� �Why UNP again? Can the President rely on and trust people from the previous regime or the SLFPers who came on board with President Sirisena after he took over the party leadership from Mahinda Rajapaksa merely for their survival, who now enjoy the benefits of ministries at the expense of the UNP victory in August elections in 2015.� �Are the President�s comments ethical? However ethics are no longer an expensive commodity in the Lankan political market. It can be ignored too.��How logical are those comments, should be the most appropriate question. It�s a fact that the President came in to office with the overwhelming support of the UNPers who rushed to the polling stations in numbers to overthrow the Rajapaksa regime. The mirror effect of that discourse was to ensure Ranil Wickremesinghe�s premiership. It was a pledge made by the President himself in the latter part of December 2014 after leaving the Rajapaksa regime.��As promised Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Prime Minister together with the President at the swearing-in ceremony.� �""The crafting of the economy since January 2015 was a collective responsibility of both the SLFP and the UNP""But it was not so in August 2017 it was the people�s mandate that made Ranil Wickremesinghe the Prime Minister with a record number of preference votes over 500,000.� �Then the supplementary budget for 100 days was passed. Subsequently, all the budget proposals thereafter were passed not by a simple majority but by a two thirds majority. Who led the SLFPers in the house to give a nod to the respective budgets? It was none other than the President. So why did not he see this earlier and rectify it? The answer is simple. There was no election forthcoming then. It means the President�s recent comment comes purely as a political stunt and as a relentless effort to hold together the dwindling masses from the SLFP.� �The crafting of the economy since January 2015 was a collective responsibility of both the SLFP and the UNP. Therefore credit of whatever the benefits passed to the masses should be shared equally by both parties that made a historic milestone in Sri Lankan polity by creating a national government by two parties that never matched ever since their inception.� �Despite shortcomings in the macro and micro economic management - the unexpected floods, landslides, droughts, dengue outbreaks, the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump � the national unity government was able to maintain the economic stability in the country.

Donate blood! and save your fellow Citizens,"2018-01-26 13:49:28							0						 				2034","�Age � 18 to 60� �Weight - not less than 55 Kg, The donor�should be healthy� �Duration � once in four months� �For regular donors, they have the approval to donate blood until they turn 60�The National�Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS)�recently announced�that the Blood Bank is facing a critical shortage of blood due to a lack of donors between January and April. Given this emergency situation, Health Capsule decided to inform the public as to how they can help save lives by donating blood.�NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa said that the Special Government Campaign conducted by NBTS comes under the Ministry of Health. It is the sole supplier of blood and blood products to all government hospitals and the majority of private sector hospitals. There are around 100 hospital based blood banks operating all over the country. Depending on their geographic location they are divided into 19 clusters. One major blood bank within the cluster has been identified as the Cluster Centre.National Blood Center (NBC) is the operational headquarters. Within NBC there are several departments and units; each playing its own distinctive role to assure the timely supply of quality assured blood and blood products and transfusion and offering transplant related services to the entire country.Diseases, operations, and accidents require volumes of blood and other blood products. During an emergency for blood or other blood products, the blood bank is responsible to ensure that demand is supplied.��Stocks decline�NBTS collects approximately 400 to 450 thousand units of blood from voluntary blood donors all over the island. Usually every hospital blood bank and the National Blood Centre in Narahenpita encounters a drop in the supply of blood between January and April each year. Likewise this year the issue cropped prematurely, resulting in the blood stocks starting to decline from the beginning of this month.�If Dengue pops up again, or if there is a need for a massive transfusion we will be facing an urgent requirement of blood and other components. Therefore every blood bank should maintain the minimum level of stocks in all blood groups. That�s why the doctors, public health inspectors and nurses in all blood banks are struggling to find donors between January and April each year. The blood bank staff in every blood bank throughout the country is ready to support any group, any organization willing to donate blood,� Dr. Saranajeewa explained.�Any person who falls between the ages 18 to 60 years and possessing a body weight not less than 55Kg can be a voluntary blood donor. Also he shouldn�t have suffered an infection recently or received treatment for a chronic disease. Any person who had travelled abroad three months before the time of the donation will not be recommended to be a donor. Every donor can donate blood every four months. �The most wanted blood types are A-, B-, O- and AB-. Negative blood type donors are less compared to the positive types we are getting regularly. Usually, we are supplying 300 - 350 red blood cell packets and 175-200 platelet packets per day to all hospitals in Colombo. To cater to this requirement, we need to collect blood daily from the donors,� she said.��Organize a campaignBe it race, religion or any personal cause, anyone can organize a blood donation campaign or donate their valuable blood to save lives, in their hometown or even in NBTS premises. The authorities at NBTS look forward to provide their services for such a cause. Before deciding the day for the donation campaign, the organizer will have to meet the medical officer in charge in their local blood bank and check the availability of a date since donor camps are organized months before an event. There�s a huge demand for blood donation camps to be organized during weekends and public holidays.Therefore, checking the available date three months prior to a campaign is advised. Elaborating on the shortage of blood, Dr. Saranajeewa said, �During the last two weeks and the end of December we had a low number of blood donors which resulted in a lesser amount of blood being collected. Some campaigns were cancelled due to the rules related to elections banning the gathering of people�. The Blood Bank requests the general public to donate blood as much as possible, immediately.A voluntary donor can donate blood at the National Blood Centre in Narahenpita during any of the 365 days of the year between 8am to 6pm. However at other hospital based blood banks, donors are allowed to make their donations between 8am to 4pm. The campaign premises should be well-known to the public and the place should be peaceful and have a clean atmosphere, parking facilities and washrooms. NBTS provides the necessary equipment for blood transfusions. All the organizers will be called for a meeting prior to the event by the respective blood banks to make them aware of how to organize a blood donation camp. The NBTS doesn�t approve blood from donors who are not volunteers.� A successful blood donation campaign is a collective effort of several groups. Friends, sports clubs, volunteer organizations, Government, and non � government organizations can organize donor campaigns. A weekday blood donation campaign should attract the participation of at least 100 people while a weekend campaign should attract around 200 donors. National Blood Centre and Cluster Centre blood banks have the capacity to conduct mass blood mobiles with the valuable participation of 1000 to 3000 donors.The NBTS maintains a donor registry which is used to call donors when blood is needed during an emergency. Anyone willing to donate blood can enter his or her name in the register at the NBTS.�A voluntary blood donation is a valuable and precious gift a person could give willingly and help save millions of lives.�",dengue
�Mixed electoral system promotes less corruption� :Duminda Attygalle United National Party,"2018-01-25 00:00:28							0						 				4018","Duminda Attygalle, a proud old boy and former rugby captain of Royal College Colombo, is another candidate contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward under the UNP ticket. Currently pursuing his Masters in Business Administration at the British School of Commerce in Colombo affiliated to Anglia Ruskins University, England, Attygalle believes that young and educated candidates should take to politics. In a candid interview with the Daily Mirror, Attygalle shared his plans for Colombo.� �Following are excerpts of the interview Attygalle did with the Daily Mirror.	I think the cream of politicians are in the UNP; people whom you can work with for the future. It has the most knowledgeable and intelligent people. The majority always tries to do something good	From my small days I have been interested in how development is done. But I have heard that things aren�t done properly and politicians blame each other. So I wanted to be a part of this situation	I�m working with Rosy Senanayake who has plans to digitize the whole system and make Colombo a smart city. That is a good process to reduce corruption and make things more transparentQ How do you feel about contesting in an election for the first time?�It�s very exciting and I learn new things everyday.� �Q Why did you want to enter politics?From my small days I have been interested in how development is done. But I have heard that things aren�t done properly and politicians blame each other. So I wanted to be a part of this situation and see what actually happens.� �Q Any particular reason as to why you want to contest from the UNP ticket?I think the cream of politicians are in the UNP; people whom you can work with for the future. It has the most knowledgeable and intelligent people. The majority always tries to do something good. Therefore it is a good place to work from.� �Q What are the main issues you have identified in Colombo?When I did my door-to-door campaigns we were doing a survey where we got all the people involved. From that survey we found out that garbage collection should receive topmost priority. The biggest problem they face is that garbage was supposed to be collected in three streams. So if waste food is to be collected on Friday the CMC people come for that on Monday. This becomes a huge issue to the entire neighbourhood when food rots and develops a stench. Therefore this process has to be monitored and they should actually collect it on the correct day. Some residents were saying that they collect in three streams, but when they come they ask to put everything together. There has to be proper supervisors to make sure it�s done methodically. On the other hand the garbage in small lanes never gets collected. So we need to put in a little bit of effort to put things right. There is also a problem with dengue. So we need to ensure that fumigation is done and all mosquito breeding sites destroyed.� �Q One issue about Colombo today is the slums, commonly known as �wathu�. During the city beautification projects they will be excavated and the residents will be relocated elsewhere. How do you see this problem, considering the fact that they are an essential component in a city landscape?They should be a part of the city, but I hope they are compensated in the event that they are moved out to a better location. I have been going to Tharawatta and those people are happy to leave provided they are given what they deserve. I believe that when they are relocated it should be done in such a way that they don�t have a need to return to their old place. If they do it properly there won�t be a problem. When I went to these places sanitation, infrastructure and other services needed more attention. It�s not fair and safe for people to live like that. They should be given better standards to live.� �Q How challenging is the new electoral system?The electoral system is good because there was no representation for places like Cinnamon Gardens during the preferential vote system. So the people and residents were neglected. But this system will ensure that there is someone responsible to see that these things are provided. If there was a person responsible to look after people in these �wathu� for example, they wouldn�t be facing so many challenges like what they are going through today. People don�t have to waste so much money in running around an entire district as well. I think it will promote less corruption.� �Q As a young candidate, what plans do you have for the youth in the city?�I�m working with Rosy Senanayake who has plans to digitize the whole system and make Colombo a smart city. That is a good process to reduce corruption and make things more transparent. So I want the youth to be involved in politics. Educated youth should be involved in politics to ensure that policies are accurately implemented. My plan is to gather youth to be a part of this process, so that they could be encouraged to be involved in active politics, in order to make a change. People think that politicians are rogues and I want to change that mindset. Therefore without criticizing politicians, more educated people should be involved in the political system.� �Q How confident are you that you will win?Cinnamon Gardens has anyway been a UNP Ward from the beginning. I�m happy to be in this ward. I�m pretty confident that I will be elected because people want young and educated people to take the lead.� ��Pics by�Pradeep Dilrukshana",dengue

JVP mayoral candidate for Colombo Municipal Council Dr. Ranil Jayasena �Improving quality of people�s life a challenge�,"2018-01-24 01:03:01							0						 				3655","My patients� living conditions forced me to enter politicswhen I went around Colombo,I witnessed�a hellThis is the most disciplined, non-corrupt party, which a person like me could joinWe can�t believe what they have been doing with the money they collect as taxesWe as the JVP are targeting to establish full power in 2020To be productive and efficient, a person needs to be healthy and educatedWith the Local Government Elections looming around the corner, the need to elect the right candidate to power is quintessential. With Colombo being a major business capital that attracts investments and promotes tourism, the Mayor of Colombo is entrusted with the major responsibility of maintaining a corrupt-free environment favorable for its citizens while ensuring the positive development of the City. In a candid interview with�Dailymirror the , Colombo Mayoral Candidate contesting under the JVP ticket�Dr. Ranil Jayasena a Gastrointestinal Surgeon by profession explained why he decided to enter politics and also talked about his plans to forge ahead in fighting corruption within Colombo, if elected. Dr. Jayasena started his career as a Gastrointestinal Surgeon at the North Colombo Teaching Hospital in 2001 and was appointed as the first ever G.I Surgeon at the National Hospital in 2009. Following are excerpts of the interview done with Dr. Jayasena.�Q�Could you tell us about yourself and why you decided to enter politics?�I�m a Consultant Gastrointestinal Surgeon who retired from service three months ago. Now I�m engaged in private practice. Actually I didn�t decide to enter politics, but was forced by my patients to come forward. I treat patients and prescribe treatment. Now I find it difficult to give instructions to patients because many can�t follow these instructions due to political problems they face. These issues are all politically motivated and patients have to face them. I will give some examples. One of the main causes for Gastritis is mental stress and I have come across so many people coming with mental stress due to political problems. Actually I have kept this issue in my mind. It has been of concern to me for a long time. When it came to a critical point I was forced by patients to come forward as the candidate. So my decision to enter politics wasn�t sudden.� �When I treat patients I ask them to have at least three meals a day and drink at least two and half litres of water to prevent themselves from developing gastritis. There were patients from some parts of the country where six people were compelled to share one litre of water among themselves due to the lack of sufficient water. This is a pathetic situation that we came across. There were patients who came to me with mental stress and severe gastritis despite being non alcoholics, nonsmokers in addition to not being frequent drug users. Nevertheless, they were experiencing severe mental stress irrespective of race and social class and this stress was linked to politics.��There were judges who suffered from severe gastritis because of the pressure they had to face from higher authorities in politics; who forced them to leave the country eventually. There were Catholic and Buddhist priests who had so many problems due to political pressure. I felt very sorry for our people and what these politicians have been doing to ruin this country. When the elections were declared I was invited to contest as the Colombo Mayoral Candidate. However before accepting the invitation, I discussed this with my family members and toured around Colombo to see whether I could do something. Through my patients, I came to know about the situation in Colombo to some extent. But when I went around Colombo, I witnessed a hell amidst the beautiful buildings. It was a pathetic situation and I saw blocked drains, collected garbage and flies and mosquitoes infesting the place. I saw small houses accommodating nearly six to seven people, where its members were sleeping according to a roster. Some houses were void of electricity. These people need to be provided with adequate accommodation and health facilities. However, nothing has been done to this effect.��Q Why did you choose to contest as the Colombo Mayoral Candidate under the JVP ticket?�This can be answered very easily. There were only two major parties that were ruling this country for seventy years; UNP and SLFP. With the SLFP broken into two factions, now we have a corrupt triangle formed by UNP, SLFP and SLPP. This corrupt triangle is full of corruption, scam and fraud. If you watch the T.V, listen to the radio or read a newspaper, you may notice that these are the words that are frequented by them.� �The only major party exclusive of this corrupt triangle is the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). This is the most disciplined, non-corrupt party, which a person like me could join. Fortunately there is at least one party for a person like me to join.� �Q It is believed that there was a lot of corruption, fraud and waste going on in Local Government Councils. If appointed as the Mayor of Colombo, what measures would you take to fight corruption?Hopefully, I will have a good theme to work on and if members of the JVP are selected in large numbers to councils (who are all non corrupt), I can give a real assurance to the country that the fight against corruption will continue. Most of the unresolved problems in the Colombo Municipal area have risen due to waste and corruption. There is no doubt about that because annually they collect 15.8 billion as taxes. We can�t believe what they have been doing with the money they collect as taxes. Among the various things people say regarding this, some say that this money is spent on certain officers to travel� abroad. There are also stories that some people are involved in the casino industry and in gambling. These officials spend excessive amount of money to entertain their relatives by giving them contracts and offering tenders to friends and relatives. However, these are facts that people say that are yet to be verified.��If I am appointed, I will put a full stop to all this corruption and will have a very transparent and non-corrupt policy where there will be no opportunity to waste money. We will take the responsibility of developing the Colombo city and where necessary, we can give contracts on tender basis.� �Q Do you believe that the country needs a new political culture?Definitely. That is why we are trying to change the prevailing culture. We ask people to extent their support to us in order to establish a firm foundation in local councils. We as the JVP are targeting to establish full power in 2020 and this is only the foundation. As a person (reference is made here to the writer) engaged in media, don�t tell me that it is not possible. This is certainly possible. What we want is for people to understand and change their attitudes. People have been in a pseudo -sleep. This means that we are not really asleep, but we are pretending to be asleep. When a person pretends to be sleeping, it is difficult to wake him up, nevertheless they can hear us. Contrarily, it is easier to reach the person who is really asleep although he can�t hear us. I think that people are in a pseudo-sleep where they can hear what we are saying and now they are slowly reaching us. Now we are giving them the real message to see whether they can understand the real situation in this country.� �As a doctor I have been spending my time with people since the day I began my career; feeling their pulse, listening to their heart beats and reading their minds. Therefore, I understand the real situation of the� country. I think I can address our people and get close to them.� �Q As a medical professional, what do you think are the drawbacks in the Sri Lankan health care and education sectors?At the national level there are plenty of issues that we need to address. We are always talking about such matters within the frame of party politics. If you talk, you can�t do anything. We have allocated only 1.3 percent for education from the Gross National Product and 1.9 percent for health. Discussing everything within this framework is not possible and this is not the policy of the JVP. We are going to talk within a different background with an allocation of at least five percent for education and six percent for health. Within this frame, we can do many� things.� �If we assume power we give priority to these things because this constitutes the heart and brain of this country. If so, it�s not difficult to develop this country. To be productive and efficient, a person needs to be healthy and educated. The education system has been put in a mess by these Governments and there is no significant development in students. As a doctor I have seen many cases where children are diagnosed with obesity, hypertension and diabetes. This is also partly due to this irregular education system where children tend to skip meals due to the number of tuition classes they are burdened with. These children get fat due to the lack of sufficient time to engage in an exercise or sport leading into various health problems at a later stage. Non communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension will deteriorate their health.� �\What we want is for people to understand and change their attitudes. People have been in a pseudo -sleep. This means that we are not really asleep, but we are pretending to be asleep. When a person pretends to be sleeping, it is difficult to wake him upOn the other hand, we can�t manage the number of beds in the hospitals. The National Hospital has 3,500 beds, but the daily occupancy of beds is about 1,500 beds. This means that everyday there are about 1,500 vacant beds in the hospital, but there are so many wards with a shortage of beds where patients are forced to either share the beds or sleep under the bed or in the corridor. They can�t even properly manage the beds in the hospital. The rulers should be held responsible for these problems.� �Q Colombo is a city that attracts a lot of investment and is also a tourist destination. Taking these facts into account, the need to maintain city beautification is also very important. What would you do to achieve this goal if elected?Beautifying the city is very important. However, if I become the Mayor of Colombo, I will definitely give priority to the alleviation of the poor peoples� lifestyle, which is in a very pathetic situation. What is the point in beautifying only the city when the lifestyle of these poor people have not improved for the better? Beautifying the country is not a difficult thing to do, but improving the quality of life of these people is more challenging and important comparatively. These measures should be carried out in a parallel manner. As for beautifying the city, first we should focus on the proper disposal of garbage. We should address the practical problem related to garbage disposal in order to maintain city beautification.� �Q What do you think are the burning issues within Colombo that need to be solved immediately?�The burning issues that need to be solved soon include proper garbage disposal, prevention of floods and the dengue epidemic. Also proper living conditions should be given to people and blocked drains should be reconstructed. Measures should be taken to avoid the risk in areas vulnerable to earth slips. Improving the condition of poorly constructed byroads is also very important.��Q What are your views regarding the new electoral system?There are both pros and cons regarding the new electoral system. The pros are that there is a person elected to the ward who will be held responsible for the work carried out in the area. So the people have the advantage of identifying and getting the work done through the elected individual. Also, there is an improvement in terms of female representation and I think that they also should be given an opportunity to be represented. However I think the number of council members are high which is a disadvantage because the Government will have to spend more money on them. However, the number of members elected through JVP will not be a burden to the country because our people are not corrupt.� �Q How confident are you of being elected to office under the new electoral system?I cannot predict the future and my real motive is to convince people of the prevailing problems in the country. I want our people to have confidence in us and extend their support to us and we will help them in return. Beyond this point, I have never thought of anything else.��Q JVP�s theme at the Local Government Elections is �Power to build villages and defeat corruption�.

Electing a professional as Colombo  mayor  ideal - SLPP candidate  Dr. Pradeep Kariyawasam,"2018-01-24 00:00:31							0						 				3402","Dengue cases dropped drastically due to former Defence Secretary�s city development��It is not advisable to build high-rise buildings on narrow roadsHousing is a pressing issue in ColomboI decided to follow former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in politics because he saved the country from terrorism65 percent of people in six percent of Colombo�land area��It is far below �WHO� requirement for space��Former Chief Medical Officer of Colombo Municipal Council�Dr. Pradeep Kariyawasam is contesting the local government elections as mayoral candidate to the Colombo Municipal Council under the �Flower Bud� symbol of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna [SLPP]. He says it is better to have a professional as a mayor of Colombo.��Q As the Chief Medical Officer of the Colombo Municipal Council for 26 years, what made you to contest the local government elections as the mayoral candidate under the Flower Bud symbol?�My whole family has been supporters of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) traditionally. My father�s youngest brother was the party�s organizer for Akmeemana in the 1980s. Now, there is a breakaway faction. Actually, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa saved our country from the scourge of terrorism and prevented it from disintegration. I thought I should follow his footsteps politically. He is someone who did a lot for the country despite various allegations.��Q Colombo Municipality has been a UNP stronghold. In fact, even when Mahinda Rajapaksa was at the height of his popularity, the UNP won in Colombo. How challenging would it be for you this time?It is a challenge. I have always taken up challenges. For example, in my Public Service Department, I should have had at least 1200 workers. I had only half of them. Yet, I did better than any of the former Chief Medical Officers. I managed to get Colombo declared as a Polio free zone.�How I did it was that I got all the staff members except labourers trained in Polio vaccination. That was to put drops in the mouths of children. In one way, we vaccinated all the children in the city who were under five years of age. Actually, this should have been done by nurses and midwives. I thought I should get the maximum out of my staff. I followed the same steps in terms of controlling Dengue, Cholera etc. I utilized the facilities and available manpower.��Actually, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa saved our country from the scourge of terrorism and prevented it from disintegration. I thought I should follow his footsteps politically. He is someone who did a lot for the country despite various allegationsQ What are the pressing concerns you have identified in Colombo?�The main thing is housing. Actually, 65% of people in the city live in underserved settlements. These underserved settlements are in 6% of the land area in Colombo. You can imagine the gravity of the problem. Their houses are too small. That is a matter of concern. In a house of 400-500 sq ft, two to three families are living. However, the WHO norm is 120-150 sq ft per person.� �Housing is a pressing concern, while land is another issue. I suggest constructing three-story buildings and give the people adequate space at the same abode where they live now. People could use the ground floor for business purposes. Women can do such activities for income generation.��There is a need to have a better transport system to get rid of traffic congestion. We find a lot of high-rise buildings on narrow strips of lands. We must ensure that no more high-rise buildings are put up in this manner. In fact, residents cannot park their vehicles. These small roads are used to ease traffic congestion on major roads.�This is one of the major complaints raised during my door-to-door canvassing process. We have to look for improved traffic designs. These narrow roads should not be used for uni-flow traffic. During rush hours, residents cannot even get out. People who live peacefully on these lands abutting narrow roads cannot do so any more. When high-rise buildings are put up on narrow roads, there is no ventilation coming to houses.�Housing is a pressing concern, while land is another issue. I suggest constructing three-story buildings and give the people adequate space at the same abode where they live now. People could use the ground floor for business purposes. Women can do such activities for income generationQ What is your plan for eradication�of Dengue?Actually, I implemented a very successful programme. After I retired, they stalled it. New types of Dengue fever are found in Sri Lanka. It happens with the arrival of some foreign nationals infected with the disease. We have to contain the spread of the disease in Colombo first. It is like the head of a body. We have to protect the head first. They stopped the anti-Dengue campaign which we initiated. After that, it spread to other areas. We had a programme that received an international award. I would like to resume it if elected to office. For that, we have to fill in the vacancies. There are about 120 vacancies for health instructors and around 50 vacancies for field assistants to control mosquito breeding. We have some other vacancies for health educators and midwives as well. All these people could be used for Dengue-control work.� �If we contain the disease in Colombo, it could be contained easily in other parts of the country.��Q Your rival candidate Rosy Senanayake of the UNP said former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa made only cosmetic changes in the city in his city development drive. What is your response?�He developed the city starting from the Port up to Gregory Road. It spread to Bauddaloka Mawatha, Bambalapitya Junction and Galle Face. That was the triangle he developed. That was how he started. After developing, we did not find a single Dengue patient in that area. The area surrounding Gregory�s lane was full of Dengue patients. Once it was developed with properly laid drainage lines, we did not find any patient in the area. What is happening now is that no one is maintaining these areas. The other thing is that it serves as a catalyst for people in the area to clean their own residential gardens. They noticed how the government did it. Then, residents also followed suit. The government�s initiative, at that time, bore fruit to people�in that manner.��Q What is your message to the city voters this time?I saw the 2018 budget. It is only Rs.18 billion. Out of that, Rs.10 billion is meant for the municipal engineers. Out of that also, Rs. 3.5 billion is spent for garbage disposal. Last time, they allocated only Rs.1.5 billion for it. This time, it has been increased by 50%. Garbage collection is outsourced to the private sector. The private sector should collect garbage daily if they receive an increased allocation. It should be looked into.��Q How important is it for professionals to join politics?I have been in the CMC for 26 years. It always had commissioners who were professionals. During the last ten years, we had administrators from the SLAS. Before that, it was either engineers or doctors who served as the�Municipal Commissioners.�If we had a mayor who was also a professional like in Singapore, we know exactly what the problems and technical solutions to them are. Rather than apportioning blame on each other, we have to find solutions in that manner. We must have a clear idea about the cost. It is a good idea that professionals are joining politics. They have the practical knowledge.��Q There is ethnic and religious diversity in Colombo. What do you suggest to foster unity among all�these groups?We should always think that we are all Sri Lankans. We should forget the religious and caste differences. We have to elect knowledgeable and qualified people to run the Council. Otherwise, we would end up being countries like Libya, Syria or Lebanon.�They stopped the anti-Dengue campaign which we initiated. After that, it spread to other areas. We had a programme that received an international award. I would like to resume it if elected to office. If we contain the disease in Colombo, it could be contained easily in other parts of the country�Q During the previous government, there was a proposal to make a Colombo Municipal Corporation. How do you see the practicality of it?I think Colombo should be expanded now. Rather than building all the institutions within the city limit, they should be taken out of the city. There are high-rise buildings coming up. Who will take the burden of all the sewer lines? It is better to have pockets of areas surrounded by parks and greenery.�That is always better to expand the city to Nugegoda, Battaramulla and Angoda areas. Also, we must have proper transport systems and roads. It is a good idea that we expand and introduce a corporation system.��Q What do you think of the new election laws governing the local government polls?It is a good thing that we got rid of the preferential voting system. Candidates are very less. In my case, I have to print a certain number of leaflets and make door-to-door visits. We do not put up posters and we held small pocket meetings.�I think Colombo should be expanded now. Rather than building all the institutions within the city limit, they should be taken out of the city. There are high-rise buildings coming up. Who will take the burden of all the sewer lines? It is better to have pockets of areas surrounded by parks and greenery�It is good in that way. The number of members to be elected has increased. It is not a good idea. There are too many members, and therefore the cost would be high. A job which is normally done by one person, has to be done by three or four people as the result.����",dengue
Local administration experiences bitterest period under current rule: Basil,"2018-01-23 00:18:22							0						 				1528","That itself is enough to unseat this government this time� �	There is no competition�from UNP�	President did unconstitutional things right after election to office�	It is not President who exposed bond scam�	Once evidence was found, police investigation should have commenced�	Bond scam is a daylight robbery�	MR�s image used by three political camps��In an interview with Dailymirror , former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa who spearheads Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) spoke about the current status of politics and the local government elections. Excerpts:�QHow do you see the progress of campaigning?�In general, voters are likely to be divided as pro-government and anti-government. There are people opposed to the government in its entirety. There are some who only oppose certain actions of the government. Next voters will be divided according to their affiliations with political parties such as the UNP- SLFP, SLPP and so forth.�According to opinion polls, only 30 per cent of people stand for the government. What is the government? That is the UNP-SLFP combination. Apart from that, we have the JVP and TNA that cooperated with the government at times while being in the opposition.�The joint opposition was the only force oppositional to the government in the real sense. Now, the JVP is also trying to join the anti-government bandwagon. Even President Maithripala Sirisena and his SLFP try to be seen as an anti-government force. All are attempting to ride on the anti-government wave of public opinion prevailing at the moment. It seems to be something hereditary with the President. He served in our government for such a long time in different posts. He was the longest serving General Secretary of the party. However, he now disassociates himself from all done during that period. That is double-acting in politics.�SLPP is the only anti-government force. The SLFP-UNP political division disappeared with the elections on January� 8, 2015. Instead of the UNP, a candidate was fielded under the swan symbol against Mr. Rajapaksa. So, it was a contest between Mr. Rajapaksa and the UNP-led force. The SLFP was formed as an alternative to the UNP by late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. Today, voters are either for Mr. Rajapaksa-led political force or against it. That is the divide line. Some people who were with us could not get nomination from us. Some of them joined hands with the SLFP. It appears to have created a split of the vote base at village level in certain instances.�QThe President is seeking a mandate to root out corruption. What is your view?�There is nothing he did to eliminate corruption. The President contested the election as the common, apolitical candidate. He promised to bring about good governance. Yet, as his first task, he appointed someone who did not have parliamentary majority as the Prime Minister. He removed the Chief Justice thus deviating from the procedure. He brought back as the Chief Justice the lady who was once impeached by Parliament along with his vote. He never kept the promise that the Cabinet would be reduced to 25. He victimized Bhikkhus, politicians, government servants and war heroes. Corruption became rampant. The cost of road projects increased exorbitantly.�QHowever, the President appointed a commission on the bond scam and exposed it to the country. What do you say about it?�It is not the President but the joint opposition that exposed it initially. It was done with the cooperation of the media and people. I have a feeling that the commission was appointed to sweep everything under the carpet. That is the original intention. Once fraud was uncovered, the government should have begun police investigations. Afterwards, action could have been taken to prosecute the wrongdoers through the Attorney General. Normally, a commission is appointed to probe cases that cannot be dealt with under the usual legal procedure. This is not something difficult to be investigated. This is a daylight robbery.�QBut, the commission was able to gather substantial evidence in its process?�In a court of law, all such evidence has to be examined once again. Everything has to be started afresh.�QThe President said he started the second operation on the bond scam. What are your thoughts?�I do not know whether it is appropriate for a leader to summon the Attorney General and give him instructions. Earlier, we were accused of keeping the Attorney General�s Department under the purview of the then President. What is happening now?�I do not think it is morally acceptable to summon the Attorney General and instruct him on judicial matters. We have to assume that all cases filed by the Attorney General have been done at the instigation of the President. How does it conform to �Yahapalana� policies?�It is wrong for any leader to summon the Attorney General. The Prime Minister also did it once and said it openly. The President is also the head of a certain political party.�QHow do you compete with the UNP at this election?�Initially, we thought the UNP would be our main challenger. I now feel that even diehard followers of the UNP will not cast their ballots this time. The present UNP leadership did the gravest harm to the party. We have differences with the UNP in terms of its economic policy and the policy on national issues. Be that as it may, right from its inception under late Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake, UNPers maintained self-respect which has been totally compromised under the present leadership. The UNP secured political clout this time in a conspiring exercise. Yet, power gained through conspiracy could not be exercised for the benefit of the party. Today, there is no challenger for us.�QYet, the UNP has support of the government. They can use it for their advantage. What is your view?�These local bodies will be constituted for a period of four years. They will remain under the current rule only for one year out of their four-year term. The Presidential election will be conducted next year. We are certain that power will be shifted to us. Then, these local bodies will be operated by our government. The elections to Provincial Councils are also due this year.�The local authorities remained dissolved for three years under the present government. They were run by special commissioners. There were severe concerns over garbage disposal, street lighting and Dengue prevention. The local authorities were unable to discharge their duties under the new government. It is the worst ever period in the history of local administration in our country. People did not receive any service from their local authorities after this government came to power.���These local bodies will be constituted for a period of four years. They will remain under the current rule only for one year out of their four-year term. The Presidential election will be conducted next year. We are certain that power will be shifted to us�QSeveral members who failed to get nomination from your party are contesting under different symbols. How will it affect your vote base?�We cannot say it now. There are 5,092 members to be elected in respect of electoral wards. We will be affected by this in 200 wards. Today, the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is used for campaigning by three parties. He is the most popular politician. We have every right to use his picture. We are the rightful owners of his vision. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) uses his image as the party�s patron. There are independent groups using it. All these three political camps owe much to Mr. Rajapaksa. Finally, all should get together to defeat the UNP.�QAre you planning of contesting the next Presidential election?�First, we focus on this election. Afterwards, there will be elections to the Provincial Councils. We will prepare for the Presidential election. It will happen.�QHave you identified the candidate?�Not yet. It has to be decided by the party.�QMP Roshan Ranasinghe said it would be former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. How true is it?�That is a question to be directed at him. We as a party have not decided on it. It may or may not be the former Defence Secretary. Last time, we heard about the common candidate at the eleventh hour.�QWill you be adopting the same modus operandi?�We will decide on it democratically.�QThe President�s term is now limited to five years. What is your view?�You see how the country was driven down the path of absolute disaster during the past three years. If the government remains for another three years, you can guess the predicament. Trimming down the term is good for the country.�",dengue

Infrastructure development triggers threat of  deer  extinction,"2018-01-19 23:34:14							0						 				1481","�Environmentalists claim deer strolling across Trincomalee face the threat of extinction mainly due to infrastructure development.

However, lunch sheets disposed in disarray by local tourists have fuelled the extinction of this species. These animals often devour leftovers on disposed polythene sheets, oblivious to the fact that what they consume ultimately determines their fate. However, the authorities have cleared arable land for infrastructure development efforts, thereby creating a scarcity of food for deer.

'Disease pattern of dengue unchanged but unusual variations can occur',"2018-01-19 03:04:15							1						 				5550","Dismissing reports indicating that the disease pattern or the dengue virus had significantly changed as baseless, Negombo's Clinical Head of the Centre for Clinical Management of Dengue Dr. LakKumar Fernando said there could be some unusual variations of the dengue virus.He told the Daily Mirror that all diseases and biological events had a classical pattern that affected the majority while some unusual manifestations could occur to a small minority.�Clinicians should identify these and treat them accordingly to the best of their ability. Treatment can also turn the disease bringing unusual results and with proper treatment most patients can be saved,� Dr. LakKumar said.Sources had claimed that a new dengue strain had been detected and the behaviour of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) had changed drastically during the dengue epidemic.According to reports several children with abnormal disease patterns were found and consequently it has become a real challenge to detect and manage the disease.�It is important for the public to improve their own behaviour to protect themselves from mosquito bites and also doctors to improve their clinical management practices than blame the virus for unusual behaviour,"" Dr. LakKumar said.Normally the Platelet count decreases on the third day of a dengue patient, but there are also occasions where Platelet count decreases on the second day.Normally the leaking of fluid occurs between the 3rd and 4th days, but it can also occur before or after the relevant period.�Settling of fever alone can deteriorate the nature of dengue. It means that some patients presume that when the fever gets cured, the whole dengue situation has come to an end. Perhaps it is not.

How does a call of nature last for 30 min? asks MR,"2018-01-18 23:56:36							48						 				21619","While urging the President and ministers not to belittle the post he holds, his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa on Thursday wanted to know if it was a bladder or a water tank that President Maithripala Sirisena has to answer a call of nature for 30 minutes.Minister Rajitha Senaratne on Wednesday said President Sirisena did not storm out of the Cabinet meeting and he had simply gone out to answer a call of nature.Mr. Rajapaksa said the minister had come up with this ludicrous excuse to cover up the fact that the President had actually been furious and had stormed out of the Cabinet meeting.�There was a drama enacted at a Cabinet meeting held recently. The scriptwriter is unknown. The President has come to the meeting, yelled and then had stormed out. Afterwards, the Prime Minister and other ministers had gone and brought the President back. This is like a boy leaving a house following a fight with his parents and is then brought back in after consoling him.When asked about this by journalists at the Cabinet briefing, Ministers say the President went out to answer a call of nature. Is it a bladder or the water tank from Colombo that the President has to answer a call of nature for half an hour?The post of President shouldn't be belittled in this manner. When this happens the country and its people also feel they are being belittled,� Mr. Rajapaksa explained.He expressed these views at a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) election rally held at the Vihara Maha Devi Open Theatre in Colombo on Thursday.Commenting on the development projects carried out by the previous government in Colombo, Mr. Rajapaksa said their objective had been to elevate Colombo City to higher standards by the time the Port City was completed.�All the development work has been reversed now.

Women�s movements   have to be stronger,"2018-01-16 00:40:29							0						 				4651","The upcoming Local Government Election has been a much anticipated event in the local political calendar. In the run up for positions, both known and unknown faces have begun their campaigns abiding to stricter laws than what was seen during the previous regime. With a new electoral system, both citizens and those contesting are expecting further �change�. Among those contesting from the Green Party, Rosy Senanayake, former beauty queen and present Deputy Chief of Staff at the Prime Minister�s Office, hopes to further her political ambitions and become Colombo�s first female mayor.In a candid interview with the Dailymirror, Senanayake shared her views with us. Following are excerpts of the interview.�QYou wish to be the first female mayor in Colombo. How do you feel about it?� �I view it both as an honour and an enormous responsibility. When it comes to women in public service, 62% of the Government sector is staffed by women, but only a small minority are in decision making positions. But how many are corporate chairpersons and on boards? How many are CEOs or even secretaries to ministries? With my election as mayor, people will see that it is time this changes and that there is a crucial need to elevate women to positions of leadership and responsibility.� �By electing a female mayor, Colombo will be showing the country and the world that it is ready to transcend gender stereotypes and be an epicenter of progress and change. I am proud that I will be the first woman who is being given the opportunity to take the mantle of this wonderful City and very proud also of the men and women of this City who are showing that they value ability, hard work, and integrity above all else.� �I am aware that becoming the first female mayor brings with it huge responsibility. As a woman, I will have to do more than just live up to expectations. I will have to exceed them. And I plan to do just that! I also realize that I will be seen as a pioneer for women holding very high leadership positions in Government and people will be watching me to see how women perform in positions of leadership. My performance in this role will have repercussions for future female leaders. I am confident that I will be able to lead Colombo to make it a safe, smart, economically viable, and corruption-free City which caters to and empowers all sections of its citizenry, leaving no doubt about the leadership potential and efficacy of women!� �QThe Capital is where women face a lot of harassment in public transport and other places. How will you ensure the safety of women while in your position?� �The harassment of women in public transport and other public places is a huge concern and something that needs to be addressed immediately. There is no point in talking about more representation for women or a louder voice for women, if women can�t do something as basic as getting from point A to point B, without fear of being harassed sexually or otherwise in a verbal, visual, or physical manner. It�s frankly unacceptable that a woman might dread her daily commute to work or other public interactions because of what she fears experiencing in the bus, train and on the street.�� However, while changing attitudes and belief systems are important and need to be started immediately, it takes time to bear fruit.� ���My plans are for a smart, safe, economically viable and corruption-free city where people will enjoy dividends�Therefore, some of the more tactical strategies that could be put in place to provide more immediate solutions include the following; ensuring that streets and pathways are well lit and exposed, commissioning more CCTVs and targeting the use of CCTV for this purpose, panic button stations that activate alarms and bright flashing lights when activated from within a certain radius, working closely with law enforcement to ensure that sexual harassment in public is something they are always alert to and respond to immediately, requiring that buses/trains that enter the city have panic bells that could be activated by buttons placed in the bus/train or even from a mobile phone, apps that link to a database that can log complaints and highlight locations of frequent harassment, encouraging documenting the harassment if possible (e.g. take a picture of perpetrator committing act) and report it via app or internet, encouraging a �see something, say something� approach in the general public, ensure transport crews are more vigilant etc.� �QAs the mayoral candidate for the UNP what are the immediate issues that need to be looked into in the Colombo city?� �My plans are for a smart, safe, economically viable and corruption-free city, one in which people will benefit, one that is environmentally friendly and where the people will enjoy dividends. All levels of society will be empowered and strengthened.

I plan to leverage ICT to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the CMC thereby enabling many services and functions to be digitalized. These include online applications, payments, E-procurements etc. I also intend to establish a high level Monitoring and Progress Review Unit reporting directly to the Mayor to tackle issues, public complaints and requests (with response deadlines) to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of all activities and functions of CMC. A Healthy City and A Healthy Citizenry is another pillar in my plans. One of the priorities will be tackling dengue. We will control dengue by identifying hotspots of dengue using past data and the new app �Epi Hack� and prioritizing areas with the highest dengue incidence. Other approaches include a Central Control Unit which will focus on quality control of food in city eateries, Multifunctional Community Centers (MCCs) to empower the community and tackle a variety of issues by reinvigorating and strengthening existing community centres and establishing new ones.��I�m also focusing on �Participatory Citizenship� where I will actively involve the citizenry in the activities of the CMC��Infrastructure is another priority. I will make maximum use of CMC�s powers to ease the burden of traffic for those living and working in Colombo.� �Cultural Development is another pillar of a new and revitalized Colombo. To cater to the future demands, we have space and areas that we have already identified to turn into restaurant strips, tourist strips and for the residents to have leisure activities such as hawker streets. I�m also focusing on �Participatory Citizenship� where I will actively involve the citizenry in planning, implementation and monitoring the policies and activities of the CMC.� �I have deliberately left the description of my plans for women and children to last, because this is something especially close to my heart. In this area, among other things, I will be focusing on Maternal and Child healthcare and a nutrition package, establishing new day care centres and monitoring existing ones etc. I am happy to say that I was able to bring to Sri Lanka a subject called �Think Equal,� which is a social and emotional value-based education which begins at pre-school; much-needed in today�s society� �I will also focus on drop-in centres for street children and the homeless, family strengthening programs to prevent institutionalization of children and school entry programs to facilitate school admission with regard to children of urbanites.� �QThe New electoral system and the law have become challenges for candidates when promoting themselves. What are your views?� �Actually the new system makes it easier for candidates to campaign. Now a candidate has to campaign only within his or her Ward. The huge amounts of money previously spent on obtaining preferential votes under the Proportional Representation (PR) system is no longer necessary and we therefore have a more equal playing field with less wastage. Minority parties are still protected because this is a mixed system and each party is entitled to appoint a number of members proportionate to the total number of votes received by that party in all the wards.� �QHow confident are you that the UNP will win the LG polls and you would be elected to office?� �I am very confident. Colombo is a UNP stronghold and even in the last Local Government Elections when we were not in power nationally, we easily won the CMC.� �QIn terms of women�s rights and their inclusion, Sri Lanka has to progress more when compared to the rest of the world. What key areas still need change?� �Security, livelihood and discriminatory laws against women and female-headed households are key areas. Even at present, women go to the Middle East for a pittance. I don�t think as a Government we have negotiated well enough with regard to safety and salary of females who are employed overseas. Empowering women economically in a sustainable and viable manner � that�s something the Prime Minister has been reiterating recently. He says he will improve standards and bring in more economic avenues for women, so that they won�t have to go and struggle in the Middle East.��Security is one of the major issues due to violence against women in this country, in addition to nutrition. It�s important that the community and decision makers be more educated about the effects of violence against women. We also don�t realise how many pregnant mothers are malnourished in the far-flung villages.� ��By electing a female mayor, Colombo will be showing the country and the world that it is ready to transcend gender stereotypes and be an epicenter of progress and change���There are other social areas as well. We have a huge female-headed household rate. One in every third household is headed by a woman. Single parenting is an issue. We need to have more social welfare. Today even if a woman wants to start a small business, she can�t go to a bank, given the things that they ask for, such as collateral. We need to see how we can help women start businesses. I believe that is an area we need to concentrate on, especially in relation to women in the north and east and in the Deep South, who are suffering.� �QAs a woman who has been in the political arena for some time, what changes could have possibly taken place if more women were in politics?� �The evidence shows that female leaders typically have more compassion and empathy. They have a more open and an inclusive negotiating style. This is a generality, of course- there are many types of leadership styles, both male and female. But women have traits more in line with modern ideas of transformative leadership; empathy, inclusiveness and an open negotiation style.Having women in positions of political leadership impacts how policy resources are spent- either through gender budgeting efforts or simply, such as in the case of climate change, showing how women experience issues differently than men. Women�s leadership also helps drive direct change in structural policies including parental leave, child care and pay. Studies systematically show that female politicians are more likely to concentrate on issues that matter more to women such as day care, gender equality, reproductive rights, flex time, elderly care, children�s welfare.� ��I am aware that becoming the first female mayor brings with it huge responsibility��QDo you think the LG polls would change the political landscape and encourage more women to enter the political scene?� �Yes definitely. I have been fighting for this! One of the major things the Prime Minister did was bring in the bill to ensure that 25% women are in local Government. That was an initial bill that he passed in the new Government. I am the most elated about this. Although I brought in a private member motion asking for 30% of women, it was thrown out. After much opposition it became 25% but I am happy with it. Next we are looking at the provincial councils with the last amendment and 25% women have been added on.� �While ensuring that more women will join politics, the next has to be a quota for parliamentary seats. In Parliament, I strongly believe that it is the PR system that is depriving women of their rightful access. You need an enormous amount of money for an election. A lot of women who want to enter politics are being discouraged as they have to go through gun and character assassination. For me, affirmative action is the only way forward and 25% is not enough. That should be the minimum, but more would be even better. We need to make it mandatory and use affirmative action with regard to the electoral systems in this country. The women�s movements have to be stronger and advocate for this.� �QThe findings of the Bond issue have imposed a black mark on the UNP and a few members in the Government as well. What is your stance regarding this case?� ��I am proud that this Government has stood up against corruption and ordered a thorough investigation into this issue. The President and PM appointed a commission with wide-ranging powers to investigate and their report has now been finalized and forwarded by the PM and President to the Attorney General�s Department for their opinion.���There is no point in talking about more representation for women if women can�t do something as basic as getting from point A to point B, without being harassed��By conducting such a thorough investigation into this issue the Government has created a huge deterrent for Government servants to be corrupt or aid in corruption. This alone should be viewed as a big win for the Government.� �One of the recommendations of the PCOI is that previous instances of irregularity in bond issuance, including that in 2008 under the previous regime be investigated. It is essential that those instances also be investigated with no delay.� �QYour son�s name also surfaced regarding the issue. What are your views regarding these allegations?� �I was surprised and shocked. My participation in COPE proceedings concluded on June 26, 2015 when I ceased to be a Member of Parliament. This allegation is from a third-party conversation on August 12, 2016, by which time I had long ceased to be an MP.� �I immediately wrote to the Speaker of Parliament categorically denying any wrongdoing either on my part or that of my son and I also wrote to the Prime Minister and I said I want an investigation because I want my name cleared. In the 100-day COPE, there was no report. D.E.W. Gunasekara tried to rush and bring a report, but Sujeewa Senasinghe, Eran Wickramaratne and everyone on that committee, including the TNA members, said the investigation had not been completed, so there can�t be a report.� �It was so unfair that my son�s name was linked. I have already written to the Speaker in this regard.� ��QThe beautification project carried out by Gotabhaya Rajapakse seems to have stopped. How will you plan out a cleaner, greener Colombo?� �While it is true that Gotabhaya Rajapakse made many cosmetic changes to Colombo, our vision is both broader and deeper.� �As I have said we will focus on making Colombo a greener cleaner City. Yes we will have more parks and develop existing ones, we will have cleaner and nicer roads and pavements. We will ensure that Colombo is a place of beauty. I have already put in place the processes for green and smart planning in all City activities.� �However, the changes we intend to make go beyond the merely superficial. Under the previous regime, no thought was given to finding green and safe solutions to garbage disposal. In fact no thought was given to even finding permanent dumping places for garbage. A garbage dump was created in Meethotamulla, ignoring the many protests of local residents, ignoring studies warning against it by the World Bank and others and we all know of the consequences. The garbage landslide, the loss of lives, the destruction of homes, the displacement of families were all foreseeable, but ignored by the previous regime. Even prior to the landslide around 30 people in the area had died due to killer germs, outbreak of dengue, kidney diseases, rat fever and skin conditions.� ���The evidence shows that female leaders typically have more compassion and empathy. They have a more open and an inclusive negotiating style��We have already identified a permanent dumping ground in Puttalam, we have already started implementing projects for hazardous waste, recycling, addressing clinical waste issues, and waste to energy etc.� �Yes, Gotabhaya pulled down walls of Government buildings and �beautified� the City. We will certainly be beautifying the City also, but we will be doing so in a sustainable and truly green manner.���",dengue
Highway network of Colombo to begin soon: PM,"2018-01-11 23:27:50							33						 				17593","Construction work on a highway network designed to ease the traffic congestion in the Colombo City will begin soon, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.Mr. Wickremesinghe revealed this at a UNP Bala Mandala meeting held at Havelock City last evening.�Construction work on an elevated highway from Kelaniya to Fort will begin soon with a highway coming from Battaramulla Junction getting connected to it. In addition,�internal waterways would be made use of for transportation thus easing the burden on the roads,� the Prime Minister said.Revealing further plans for the city, he said the City of Colombo will be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) soon. �Three such power plants will be set up to resolve the energy issue in Colombo with Japan and India each funding a plant,� he explained.He said Colombo would be developed as a City which connects Kandy and Hambantota.�The previous regime boasted about their deeds of beautifying Colombo, however this has only resulted in pushing the country further into a debt trap and it is our government that has to bear the burden,� he said.The Prime Minister highlighted that this government, in addition to paying past debts,�now has the additional burden of the garbage problem. �Many thought that we will not shift the Meethotamulla garbage dump but we have shifted it to Puttalam,� he said.UNP Mayoral Candidate for the Colombo District Rosy Senanayake, speaking on the occasion, promised to turn the City of Colombo into a smart city.�Colombo will have to develop and become a modern city parallel to the Port City and I am determined to take up this challenge,� she said.She also pledged to find a lasting solution to the garbage issue and eradicate dengue in Colombo.

Sri Lanka records highest tourist arrivals in 2017,"2018-01-06 00:39:23							0						 				10304","Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka reached an all-time high of 2,116,407 in 2017, according to the latest data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.The arrival figure for 2017 represents a 3.2 growth or 65,595 more arrivals over the preceding year when the figure crossed the 2 million mark for the first time.The higher number of arrivals has been achieved despite serious set-backs to the tourism industry right throughout 2017. The first setback was the partial closure of the country�s main airport from January to April where many airlines either scaled down operations or completely halted flights to Colombo.However just weeks after the airport reopened in April, the southern half of the country experienced devastating floods that cut off access to many resort areas resulting in adverse international media publicity that had an impact on forward bookings.This was followed by an unprecedented dengue epidemic centered around the commercial capital Colombo that lasted several months which too resulted in negative reports on international media resulting in at least one country issuing a travel advisory based on the issue.Further flooding and a severe drought in the central and northern parts of the country in the latter part of the year added to the climatic woes suffered by the tourism industry during the year which according to industry sources impacted forward bookings.According to SLTDA data, arrivals in December grew from 224,791 in 2016 to 244,536 in 2017 reflecting an 8.8 growth rate which augurs well for the winter season ahead.India continued to be the top source market with 384,628 arrivals (up 7.8 percent) followed by China with 268,952 (down 1 percent) and UK 201,879 (up 7.3 percent).Of the total number of arrivals 2,085,272 reached the country via BIA in Katunayake, 5,491 via MRIA in Mattala, 10,569, via Colombo harbour, 14,099 via Galle harbour and 976 via other ports according to statistics from the Department of Immigration and Emigration.�",dengue
Honesty and Exprertise The Crucial Needs in 2018,"2018-01-03 00:22:55							0						 				1173","While�Sri Lankans have welcomed 2018 with much hopes, the Daily Mirror spoke to experts in various fields, including areas such as politics, economics, law, health, education and environment, to find out what realities lie ahead during the new year.� ��Sri Lanka shouldn�t compromise on the value of its eco systems�- Gunawardene�Adding his comments with regard to the environmental sector, Environmental Lawyer Jagath Gunawardene said that whenever there is a problem pertaining to the environment, the issue has been addressed immediately. Also, he said that currently he is focusing on biodiversity related issues.� �Commenting on what needs to be done for environmental conservation in Sri Lanka, he had the following to share with the Daily Mirror.� �Meanwhile,, there are certain development schemes that have been proposed which would compromise on the integrity of certain ecosystems which needs to be prevented�When you make an assessment of the past year, one may observe certain successes as well as failures. We have succeeded in bringing regulations pertaining to the use of polythene, but have failed in terms of asbestos where the ban on it has been revoked. So we want a stronger country, which can withstand the pressures put by other countries who have their own vested interests. So that is one area I expect the country to be stronger. Also, it is important for the country to be aware of its own vulnerabilities, not only in the environmental sector, but in a much broader scale. However, since some vulnerabilities end up as environmental issues, we should know where our vulnerabilities lie and how to overcome them,� he said.� �Secondly, Gunawardene added that as a country, Sri Lanka has been successful in getting certain areas declared as protected while opining that there are so many other areas that needs to be protected likewise. �Meanwhile, there are certain development schemes that have been proposed which would compromise on the integrity of certain ecosystems which needs to be prevented. We should take remedial action when and where necessary and prevent such unwanted activities from taking place under the guise of development; that is destroying or compromising on the value of our eco systems. That�s one of the areas that we have been currently working on and this might continue into the future� he added.� �When inquired about the laws that need to be reformed or renewed in the environmental sector, Gunawardene added that it was a long process. �Currently the Environment Act is in the process of being revamped for the past several years and so is the Forest Conservation Ordinance and the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. We need to wait and see how things would progress into the future. More than amending the laws, I believe that we need to have regulations. There is a need for two more new Acts which are pending for too long. These are; the proposed Act on Biosafety and proposed Act on controlling alien organisms. These are the things we expect to happen in the near future,� he said.� ��I hope treatment will be offered at a low cost or no cost��- Dr. WijewickremaSpeaking to the , Consultant Physician of the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) Dr. Ananda Wijewickrema opined that he expects the health sector would further improve its standards in order to offer a good service to the public. Adding his New Year wish for 2018, he said that he expected the prevalence of diseases to be low this year. �I hope that those in need of treatment would have the opportunity to receive it at a low cost or no cost. I also wish that the people will be healthy. At present there are many plans underway in the health sector. While some plans are already being implemented and are progressing, some are still in the listing. These plans will be useful for the betterment of the health sector. There are many development plans in the health sector in terms of the infrastructure, improving of facilities, staff training and etc,� Dr. Wijewickrema said.� �There are many development plans in the health sector in terms of the infrastructure, improving of facilities, staff training and etcWhen inquired about the progress of the dengue vaccine, he said that currently a group of consultants had been appointed to look into the matter. �A group of experts has been appointed to make recommendations regarding the dengue vaccine on whether to use the vaccine in Sri Lanka. However, the committee decided to wait for more evidence to emerge; a decision that was taken about four months ago. And we are glad that we made that decision with new evidence surfacing recently,� he added. These evidences will be taken into account prior to arriving at a final conclusion,� he said.� ��Procedural and institutional reform needed to overcome backlog of cases�-� Palitha Fernando, PCOne of the major issues confronting the judicial system of this country is the severe backlog of cases. This applies to both civil and criminal cases. A civil case takes a long time before it is taken up for hearing. If all those formalities are attended to by a roll court specially established for that purpose and the cases are taken up only when they are ready for hearing as in some other countries, the hearing of cases could be expedited to a very high degree. Experts in the area of Civil law should be consulted in cutting short the procedural aspects to ensure the expeditious disposal of cases.� �There is no use pressurizing judicial officers to expedite disposal when they have a heavy load of cases. That would not serve the interests of justice. Deciding upon the rights of the people is not an easy task. You cannot rush through cases. Getting judicial officers to sit till 4.00 p.m and getting them to hear cases is counterproductive. It is humanly impossible to concentrate and hear complicated legal issues when you are exhausted. A judge needs to do research, consider the evidence he has heard and write the judgment with a lot of care. I do not think the judges of today work in such an environment. Increasing the number of judges is one of the most important steps that should be taken immediately.� �Judges and officers of the Attorney General�s Department are very badly under paid. But increasing their salaries isn�t the solution. None of them have delayed work because they are underpaid. Even if their salaries are increased they will not be able to do better than what they are doing now as they are stretched to capacity and it is humanly impossible to do more.� �If the judges are to concentrate upon the backlog of cases, then the new cases would get stagnated. As I have suggested even before, it would be appropriate to appoint retired judges on contract basis for a period of one year and set them a target to conclude a reasonable number of cases. I would even suggest to have a system where a judge sits from 9.30 a.m to 1.30 p.m with a break of 20 minutes as we did during those days and for a retired judge to sit from 2.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m to conclude the backlog. We need to obtain the services of a different staff comprising workers like stenographers to sit with the retired judge. I know of judges who sat till 6.30 p.m. thinking that they were giving their best. But the poor court staff were extremely unhappy and worked under tremendous pressure. A person must be happy at work. It is only then that he would offer his maximum.� �There is no use pressurizing judicial officers to expedite disposal when they have a heavy load of cases. That would not serve the interests of justice. Deciding upon the rights of the people is not an easy taskThe situation in criminal cases is disastrous to say the least. People are punished for offences committed by them, over 15 years ago. By the present time some of them have rehabilitated themselves completely. The judicial system awakens after a deep slumber and destroys their lives and that of their families totally. Though we do not see this it is a great social problem today. Children are made to suffer due to no fault of theirs. They suddenly find their father missing at home. We need to conclude criminal cases as expeditiously as possible. I designed a scheme for the early disposal of cases related to child abuse. The scheme was funded by UNICEF. The Sri Lankan rep having read the report regarding my scheme said that if the scheme is successful it would be presented with a world award. However, to my utter disappointment it never got off ground.� �I would recommend that we reduce the number of cases in each court house. After the 13th amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka we have two High Courts. The High Court of Sri Lanka and the High Court of the Provinces. Both functions are performed by the same court. This I think should stop as early as possible. A criminal trial court should hear only criminal trials. Bail applications calling matters and any other matter should go before a separate court.� ��Forthcoming LG Elections a milestone for the country��- Purasinghe�After the establishment of the present Government back in 2015, it is praiseworthy that democratic traditions are gradually being reset in the country. There is freedom to politically criticize any person or any party. We can have hopes that the forthcoming Local Government Elections will be held fairly and transparently, said Terrance Purasinghe Senior Lecturer� in Political Science at Sri Jayawardanapura University.What makes all of us wonder about is the much confused and complicated political situation prevailing in the country. The main political forces the UNP and the SLFP that have joined hands in the unity Government are having contradictory agendas, views and opinions. When the UNP suggests abolishing the executive presidency, the SLFP wants it to remain. This kind of situation poses a question on the stability of this Government as there is no consensus between the two political parties.� �At this rate, it can be predicted that the UNP will smoothly win and have the ability to consolidate power of a majority of the LG bodies.�One of the the major obstacles the Government is confronting is uncontrollable and unhealthy party politics. When making nationally important decisions the Cabinet of ministers, comprising both UNP and SLFP members, act in a bias manner to suit the agendas of their own political parties. This is not healthy for the common good of the country. This clearly showcases the immaturity of the Sri Lankan political system. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have failed to maintain a single consensus among the cabinet of ministers.� �However, the forthcoming Local Government Elections will be a milestone for the country. As a result of the split in the SLFP, undoubtedly the benefit goes to the UNP. The vote base of the UNP is certain and unshakable.� �If someone says that the Central Bank Bond issue, where names of several UNP ministers were mentioned, would be an issue for the UNP to secure more votes, I don�t think so. People in rural areas are not really concerned about this bond issue. It is the urban middle class people who are concerned about the bond issue. What the people in rural areas care about is their welfare.� �At this rate, it can be predicted that the UNP will smoothly win and have the ability to consolidate power of a majority of the LG bodies. If the UNP gains power in the majority of LG bodies, President Sirisena will be compelled to face a very decisive situation where he will have to decide with whom he should be politically united thereafter. I think Maithripala Sirisena�s political future will be a success only if he continues the accord with the UNP.� �The practice of the Joint Opposition members in spreading racism and separatism among the people can�t be accepted. The unwavering efforts of the Joint Opposition will be futile because the SLFP Maithri fraction is much stronger than the JO members. If the split in the SLFP continues or worsens, the benefit at the next Presidential Elections goes to nobody else, but the Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickeremesinghe.�Razor sharp thinking neededIn areas like education, nature and economy���We need one clean, educated and honest Government��- Dr. Senanayake�In his comments, Chairman of Rainforest Rescue International and Systems ecologist Dr. Ranil Senanayake said he believes that the biggest perpetrators are those in the Government. �As professionals they are a set of ill-educated and irresponsible politicians who should be responsible for this situation. Therefore they don�t understand the long term repercussions. One of the major issues was giving away lands from the elephant corridors,�said Dr. Senanayake.� �The year 2017 was not good for elephants. With the inhumane killing of the Galgamuwa cross-tusker and the gradual deaths of several other elephants, the Subject Minister proposed the use of GPS collars to track elephants. While many wildlife experts disagreed with this move, a practical solution to the save remaining tuskers and elephants in the wild is yet to be proposed. Speaking with regards to using collars, Dr. Senanayake further said that collaring is not a practical solution.Issues pertaining to wildlife should be taken as part of the national development plan�Issues pertaining to wildlife should be taken as part of the national development plan. We need to have one clean, educated and honest Government in moving forward. Until we have an intelligent bunch of politicians these issues will aggravate in time to come,�he said.� ��Education Reforms Introduced sans analysis of root cause��� Dr. Nirmal Ranjith DewasiriAsked about anticipated changes in the education sector in 2018, Former President of the Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA), Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri said while there were a number of measures undertaken by the Government to reform education, they are likely to result in futility.� ��The Government has introduced various reforms in education, but personally I don�t see these measures serving any purpose. For instance, they introduced the �Langama Pasala, Hondama Pasala� (Nearest School is the Best School) concept. This concept has been introduced without analysis of the root cause. One has to admit that certain schools may receive some benefits through this project. But this is not a suitable solution to the overall concerns,� Dr. Dewasiri said.� �Authorities are deliberating reducing the number of subjects offered at the O/L exam to six subjectsThe Government introduced the programme in 2016, after identifying development of all schools as a priority need. This was also done with the objective of providing equal educational opportunities to all children. However according to Dr. Dewasiri, this is not the optimum solution to the issue of admitting students to popular schools in urban areas.� � �The issues arise as a result of the race to admit children to popular schools in urban areas. It is a problem born out of competition and this project will not address it. The pressure encountered in performing during the O/L and A/L examinations too weighs in on this problem. Therefore this is a far more complex matter that can�t be addressed with a simple policy. This solution will not have any impact on rivalry and competition among students,� he said.� �The former president of FUTA opined that during a recent meeting held to discuss the education policy framework, this subject was extensively discussed. Many experts had opined that this effort will not solve persistent issues in education. Experts present at the meeting believed that the approach to solve the issues was itself erroneous, as they had not understood the subject.� ��Authorities are deliberating reducing the number of subjects offered at the O/L exam to six subjects. What they don�t understand is such a move will not decrease the pressure or the competition among students. The change of subjects too will have no impact. The system of examination needs to change,� he stressed.� ��The entire education system is full of issues. Unfortunately those in the offices of the World Bank have a hand in the formulation of these policies, as they seem to be more knowledgeable on these issues than local experts,� he added.� �In December Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed Vice-Chancellors of all Universities to upgrade the quality of higher education instead of prioritizing construction of university buildings. Responding to this statement Dr. Dewasiri said it was easy for politicians to make such statements.� ��What are the indicators to measure the quality of education?� he countered. �The quality of education in universities is dependent on many other areas. The primary and secondary education must be of good quality. First of all issues in the secondary education system must be resolved, before we can attempt to better the quality of education in universities,� Dr. Dewasiri said.� ��Slowing down of growth a major challenge�- Prof. Abeyratne�The Sri Lankan economy has faced various fluctuations during the previous year. �While many industries are contributing to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it�s crucial that Sri Lanka has a stable economy in moving forward,� said Professor of Economics at University of Colombo Sirimal Abeyratne.� �Prof. Abeyratne added that when reviewing last year there was a slowing down of growth. �This situation has been present for a few years. This slow down is mostly in the tradable sector including the export growth. This is a major challenge. Other macro problems such as interest, inflation and the exchange rate are accelerating growth. Particularly accelerating growth in the tradable sector should be the policy focus this year,�he underscored.� �While many industries are contributing to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it�s crucial that Sri Lanka has a stable economy in moving forwardWhen asked how each sector could contribute to the GDP, Prof. Abeyratne said that the Government can promote any sector. �When the right environment is provided the investors will find the right sector,�he opined.� ���",dengue
Yellow fever: A not so colourful disease,"2017-12-29 14:33:30							0						 				2048","�While Dengue plagues the people in the Asian region, yellow fever has become Dengue�s partner in crime, severely affecting the health of those living in the African region. Though it is true that yellow fever is not prevalent in Sri� Lanka, Health Capsule is ever ready to endow you with knowledge. In this week�s edition, Prof. Arjuna De Silva, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama, speaks on yellow fever.��Yellow fever is a mosquito borne virus that affects the body�s organs, mainly the liver. The non-communicable disease is transmitted by an infected mosquito carrying the virus. The disease shows three phases: infection, remission and intoxication. The condition shares many similarities with Dengue. The symptoms displayed by a patient suffering from yellow fever are just like Dengue symptoms,� Prof. De Silva accentuated.��Turning yellow��During the infection phase of yellow fever, a patient may experience headache, fever, muscle and joint aches and vomiting, similar to the case of Dengue.�These symptoms including fever disappear during the remission phase. And during the intoxication phase, most of the body�s organs may malfunction due to damages caused by the disease. The heart, liver and kidney are some main organs that will be influenced adversely.��The characteristic symptom of yellow fever is jaundice. Due to the malfunctioning of the liver, there will be a buildup in a yellow pigment known as bilirubin in the body. Worn out red blood cells are destroyed by the liver. The breakdown of these cells result in the creation of bilirubin. Due to impairment in the liver�s metabolism, there will be an accumulation of bilirubin which causes the skin and white parts of a patient�s eyes to turn yellow,� Prof. De Silva said.��A blood test�says it all�Yellow fever is diagnosed through blood and antibody tests,� Prof. De Silva said. When a patient contracts these symptoms, a blood test can confirm the condition so that immediate treatment can be taken.How to overcome the yellow fever challengeSimilar to Dengue, yellow fever has to be treated on time. Otherwise complications may develop and even lead to fatality,� Prof. De Silva said.�A person can recover with treatment and rest. So medical care and bed rest are key factors of treatment. Prof. De Silva said the treatment includes a yellow fever vaccine. This vaccine is available in Sri� Lanka too. Just like Dengue, there is no particular cure for yellow fever. A patient may recover with time. The positive point of yellow fever over Dengue is that there is a proper vaccine against the disease.��Vaccination is key�The probability of contracting yellow fever in the island is quite nil in Sri� Lanka. However, you are under the high risk of yellow fever if you are planning to visit the African region. Therefore, it is strongly advised to get the yellow fever vaccine before migrating to regions where yellow fever is prevalent.�",dengue

Accountability of  implementing  restrictions on use of polythene,"2017-12-19 00:02:38							0						 				1004","The baseless, opposing attitude to any decision taken in favour of national interests has become a common feature among the people of Sri� Lanka. This negative attitude to any proposal put forward for the sake of proper evaluation of contents therein has caused irreparable loss to the country.� �The usual uproar seems to be spiraling against the restrictions recently imposed on the use of polythene products such as lunch sheets, bags popularly known as �silisili� bags and other polythene based products. There are two different views of opinion in this regard. While there are usual roaring by those who don�t want to bother to understand the real situation. Here are also trends of favourable response from those who view the problem analytically and understand long-term gains of the remedial measures taken by the authorities to ease the gravity of looming disaster linked with the intense use of polythene products.The need for restrictions on extensive use of polythene and polythene products and haphazard disposal manners of these items was first stressed about a decade ago in 2007 when the usage of polythene began to pose a great threat to the human life, animal world and the environment.At the time, a total ban was not imposed but the thickness of the extensively-used lunch sheets was prescribed to be of 20 micro metre considering possibility of re-using the polythene sheets after properly cleaning them and for the convenience of separating the disposed polythene sheets from the rest of the garbage.The thick polythene then existed in use posed difficulties to sort them out from other decaying waste and these thick sheets also reacted as resistant to the decaying process of other materials disposed. However, although polythene sheets of prescribed gauge were introduced to the market, the failure to follow sorting procedures stipulated with new measures rendered it unsuccessful. And subsequently, these garbage mixed with degradable polythene piled up and formed huge mountains that collapsed and killed hundreds of people.The recent outbreak of Dengue that claimed a large number of lives and sudden surge of floods in Colombo and its suburbs are other examples of menace of garbage accumulation beyond controllable level.Efforts taken to encourage polythene of lower gauge also serves as a measure of economy as large some of money spent for the import of raw materials to produce polythene sheets.Another favourable result gained in implementing the restrictions introduced in 2007 is the initiative to minimise the issuing of polythene bags to customers by the islandwide supermarket network.Despite the regularisation of polythene use, supermarkets are still major centres responsible for adding more degradable polythene to the environment. However, the managements of supermarkets have now taken apt steps to discourage their customers on the use of polythene bags.The strength and rights enjoyed by consumers in foreign countries have made them capable of forming consumer societies to halt any harmful item entering the markets. The inability of local customers to see the right and power they enjoy has left them to be constant prey to the world of trade. This has resulted in flooding our markets with substandard goods.Attractively prepared advertisements being displayed or glamorous packing and wrappers to lure young women to beautifying products are good examples that reflect consumer ignorance to the tactics of producers and traders. The instances of substandard beautifying items with intoxicant substance entering the local market are quite possible in the absence of proper regulatory measures to ban these items.�""The inability of local customers to see the right and power they enjoy has left them to be constant prey to the world of trade. This has resulted in flooding our markets with substandard goods""There are also instances of consumers being victims of market forces due to the lack of knowledge of their rights and power which allow businessmen to exploit consumers by abusing their own rights and powers. Seeking a court relief by consumers on the ban imposed in 2007 on polythene use is another example of abusing their own rights by others.Their own ignorance and reluctance to accept the favourable solutions introduced to hazardous situations faced by them have led them to experience more devastating conditions like the Meethotamulla catastrophe. After all these destruction, we are again focusing to overcome the problems generated with the use of polythene after a decade. However, baseless but organised and politician-supported protests against the attempts to minimise the use of polythene may come up as usual. Meanwhile, some may call for the impracticable total ban of polythene, plastics and allied products, to dilute the significance of the true efforts to minimise the use of polythene and plastic to a possible extent.To achieve the expected targets with the restriction on the use of polythene and plastics, the following factors must be subjected to a thorough analysis:- A careful evaluation of the comparatively high advantages of convenience and facilities gained with the coming of polythene and other non-degradable material came into use against the losses so far suffered in using these materials. And the introduction of a proper procedure for the use of less harmful polythene considering their applicability in the modern world.The extent of consumers� and producers� compatibility to the new procedures introduced with a legal effect and responsibility of the relevant authorities to prepare a suitable background to ensure the proper enforcement of stipulated procedures. And to encourage the people to sustain the compliance to new procedures. However, under the prevailing conditions, many deficiencies are visible in this respect.It is of foremost necessity to introduce the best alternatives (materials) in place of the banned materials, mainly for the convenience of consumers.� Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that there is no scientific mechanism to test the environmental friendliness of alternatives without depending on producer assurance of the quality of their alternative products.There is adequate potentiality within the country to establish laboratories, conduct tests and to do research with a minimum effort, but due to the absence of a proper streamlining of procedures, these resources remain scattered and idle.It is also important to focus on the possibility of new alternatives (bags) made using other highly non-degradable material that have not been included in the related act. This situation has opened new avenues for researchers of the allied field in universities and other scientists to refute challenges from some organised groups about the contribution and effectiveness of experts� services for the benefit of the country.The writer is a Senior Lecturer inAnalytical ChemistryFaculty of Applied SciencesSabaragamuwa University of Sri LankaFormer National Committee Member (control of polythene and associated products)��",dengue
HOW �CRISIS TOURISM� AFFECTS SRI LANKA,"2017-12-18 00:44:27							0						 				3419","Tourism as a whole is rather resilient to crisisIt has been reported in the print media, that tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka would face a downward trend in the near future. The findings have been made by Fitch Ratings and its exclusive report has come out from a deep and penetrating study. Following are the main findings of the report.��(a) Sri Lanka�s hotel industry is likely to face several impediments in the next four years as tourists arrivals to the island slows down.(b) Sri Lanka will lag behind most developed tourism destinations.(c) Sri Lanka will fall short of its 2020 target of four million arrivals by nearly 400,000 visitors, as the expected compound growth rate bring in only 03.6 million travellers.(d) Earnings from tourism is to be limited and curtailed due to slower growth in tourist spending over the medium term. This is mainly due to the inflow of low spending Asian tourists from the Indian and Chinese resource markets.(e) Mice-Tourism remains significantly under-exploited, accounting for less than 01% of tourist arrivals in 2016.(f) However, during the first three quarters of this year, tourist arrivals to the island reached 1.55 million, up by 2.9% from 1.5 million in 2016. Tourism earnings during this period has also recorded an increase.��Highlighting ,this situation in world-wide tourism trends, a research study undertaken by the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism based in Germany has unearthed the fact, through its well researched publication-�Tourism Development After the Crisis�, that the tourism industry has taken a particularly hard beating from the economic downturn in the capitalist world, explosively spreading unemployment, widespread income loss and a sudden uncertainty as to the present and future value of assets and the safety of savings.It will also affect old age pensions and life insurances and will instil dire consequences for investment and consumption. This research which covered present trends in several leading resource markets has found that large number of tourists retrenched on their holiday travel and/or spent less on their trips (cheaper rooms, fewer restaurant visits, cheap meals and drinks self supply, low budget shopping etc.).��Further, business travel, directly related to foreign trade, commerce and investments, has suffered immensely even surpassing the decline of holiday trips, excursions and adventure tours.��The adverse economic conditions, recessions and skyrocketing cost of living will force travellers, all over the world to tighten their belts. The tight consumer budgets will be obviously be spent on the necessary consumer goods, while expenditure for holidays and/or luxuries will be reduced, postponed or cancelled.The loss in wealth during the crisis will also increase saving rates and limit the growth of private consumption and tourism activities. The inevitable consolidation of public finances will require higher taxes and/or cuts in public spending, which will in turn limit purchasing power. Such dampening factors will be further aggravated by the fact that households, companies and business organizations will have to search for ways and means to readjust their balance sheets. This is certainly a time consuming job which will have detrimental effects on the�recovery process.��Another critical point determining future trends is the demand and supply-side-driven price development. This recession has made tourists highly price sensitive and it looks like this will not change for a considerable period of time, partly because of uncertainties about their future employment situation, partly in the hope of getting some last minute bargain and/or the ultimate cheapest deal, tourists have taken to last minute bookings so that prices have come under massive downward pressure, as there is an inelastic demand for the supply.��Taking into consideration the present situation, the sluggish recovery process, unpredictable uncertainties and tight travels budgets, it will be difficult for the industry to easily and rapidly return to pre-crisis levels.��In this prevailing situation, tourists prefer to travel to nearby places that are easy accessible. They will travel to close by destinations by using their own car or get into a train to reach the selected point, Choosing a holiday spot closer to home minimizes the risk of surprisingly high product prices and disappointing quality, as it is assumed that people have a significantly greater product knowledge about near educe destinations than about long distance destinations.Another factor driving consolidation in long distance destinations is that airlines, adjusting their capacities to lower demand, reduce or eliminate their flights to these destinations which then suffer from an even greater lack of demand.��Various stakeholders of tourism, foreign and domestic tourists alike and providers of services as well, are used to these booms and slums and it has been found through its own experience that they develop specific behaviours to face crises of this nature. The ongoing financial crises in the world and the recession that followed and its impact affect the different tourism categories in different ways and with shorter and longer time lags.��Wide ranging government interventions have supported demand and lowered uncertainty and systemic risks in the financial markets. However, the recovery will be slow, as financials systems remain impaired, public support schemes will gradually have to be withdrawn to reduce the huge public debt and households that suffered from a loss in wealth as a consequence of the financial crises will start to rebuild their savings stocks.��The findings of the World Tourism Organization have proved that emerging countries in the world were able to handle the crises situation better than the developed countries. Their dynamic markets and the strong increase of their domestic tourism potential softened adverse effects of the crisis.��However, 57% of international tourism arrivals still take place in the developed countries.��It is a fact that good governance is essential for successful tourism development which satisfies the desires of the visitors and the needs of the concerned local population. UNWTO has developed principles of good governance which are embodied in its �Global Code of Ethics for Tourism�.��Dengue menace and health warnings issued by respective governments, high hotel rates compared to other markets in the region, political unrest are also contributory factors to the emerging situation in Sri Lanka.��� �",dengue

Destination marketing: Need of the hour,"2017-12-07 00:26:28							0						 				704","Sri Lanka is awash with Chinese money. The Port City, Hambantota Port, Mattala Airport and the Lotus Tower are all investments by China. Unfortunately, Chinese tourists� arrivals are not eeping pace with their investment.The basic fact is that Sri Lanka lags behind in destination marketing and that is the main reason why the tourism industry is experiencing stagnant occupancy and, in the absence of a proper coordinated global media campaign, we are still attracting low-spending tourists.In addition, the ever-increasing room inventory in Colombo and the growing informal sector have also become a major threat to the hotel industry.Skills shortage remains a major challenge for the industry in the short and medium terms. This year, The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) launched its first ever Rising Star 2017/18 event, a competition designed to recognise talented youth engaged in the industry and to induce fresh blood into the industry.Women�s participationNext year, we have plans to launch a campaign to increase women�s participation in the industry which is targeting an additional 150,000 trained employees by the year 2025 to supplement the 350,000 employees who are in employment at present.In the absence of adequate conference facilities to accommodate large conferences and exhibitions, we hope that the government will continue to support high end luxury goods-retailers and promote international events to attract the growing Indian middle class to the country.Today, Sri Lanka�s hotel industry is the highest indirect tax paying industry in the region, next to India. Other competing destinations such as Mauritius, Seychelles, Maldives, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam pay a maximum of 5 percent -10 percent on top line (indirect taxes) compared to 22.5 percent� in Sri Lanka. If this trend continues, the hotel industry will out-price itself and become further uncompetitive with other regional peers.Therefore, the country�s promotional plan is critical at this juncture to stimulate demand. This year, the tourism industry started off on a bad footing facing a two-pronged attack � floods and dengue, attracting adverse world headlines.However, with active promotion by the private sector and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) in the last quarter of this year, exemplified by the recent hosting of the International Choir Games and the power boat competition, we saw a dramatic increase in publicity for Sri Lanka.�All in all, with the hosting of top British travel writers in London and successful road shows in Australia and China, the arrival of new charters and increased frequency by some Gulf carriers and the KLM, we can expect a good winter season this year.This year�s budget, too, added much needed stimulus to the industry; streamlining of issuance of liquor licenses and operating hours, reducing of excise duties on selected liquor and lowering of import duties on meat products, coupled with 1 percent tax on commission earned from online travel agents and the subsidised loan system for installation of renewable energy systems for hotels and SMEs will encourage better environmental practices for the hotel industry in general.�This year�s Budget also made it compulsory for all informal sector accommodation providers to be registered. This is welcome news for the formal sector as this will reduce the leakage of foreign exchange earnings to the country and eventually enhance tax revenue for the Government.Great expectationsWith the entry of more and more international brands to complement the local specialised brands, the hotel industry in Sri Lanka is continuously setting the bar high in terms of delivering great expectations to our customers and being able to meet them.If we can get the global marketing and communications campaign launched by early next year and continue promoting the destination effectively, possibilities of the tourism industry becoming the largest foreign exchange earner and one of the sectors to attract the largest Foreign Direct Investment to the country can be transformed into reality.[The writer is the President of The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) and the Chairman/Managing Director at Mt.

In Colombo, Vavuniya, Mulaituvu and Kalutara, we have an understanding with Prabha Ganeshan�s party to contest the elections.� ��Did you receive any invitation from former President Rajapaksa to jointly contest the elections?I am always in touch with him. I am also in touch with the present President.� ��Did Rajapaksa request you to contest under the Flower Bud symbol this time?�No. He told me, �Thonda you learned a lesson during these two years. Now you have to reestablish yourself. You do what is right for you�. Both the former President and the current President told this to me. As you know, the CWC always works with the Head of State. My grandfather Saumyamurthy Thondaman also did the same as the founder leader of the party.� Even for one day, I haven�t mentioned� a minister�s post to the President. We don�t want a minister post to serve people. We have a big trade union well entrenched in the estate sector.� ��What are the new political dimensions of the�plantation community?�Today, youngsters have come to the urban areas. They get influenced by the urban setup. Senior people know the background �how the trade union commenced, how much it contributed etc. Youngsters have shifted to urban areas. The moment they shift to urban areas, they have a different outlook. They have forgotten how the trade union commenced among other things. They think you can maintain a trade union only if you have political power. That is the latest trend. The CWC can stand alone with or without political power. For others to survive, they need some form of political power.� ��How are you planning to attract young voters again?You would see it at the end of the elections. We should never reveal plans. After the elections, I will grant you a similar interview.� ��There is a big demand by Government Ministers Mano Ganeshan and others to create a couple of more local authorities in the Nuwara-Eliya District. How do you see it?This wasn�t created by them. This was started in 1989 by my grandfather, S.B. Dissanayake and Renuka Herath. Due to some reason or other, it was put off. There was some opposition to it. There were so many negotiations later on.� �But, the present lot in the Government should be credited for pushing it faster this time. Today, they have the political strength to push for things. I appreciate it.� ��One former local Government member of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha challenged the creation of a new local body, citing the entrance to Sripada as an objection. How do you look at it?Sripada falls under the Sabaragamuwa Province. Only the entry point to the peak is within our area. For so many years, we have received Sripada processions. Both the communities go on pilgrimage to Kataragama. Both go to Thirupathi together. What is wrong with us respecting Sripada?� �Only shallow minded people create problems. It is good if both the communities can participate in it. I don�t know why they get so jittery about it. If you ask the Chief Incumbent of Sripada, he would tell you I organised the function to mark the arrival of Sripada procession grander. We respect it. We go there for blessings as well.� ��In making the new Constitution, what are your proposals to ensure the political rights of Tamils of Indian origin?Our thinking is that we are Sri Lankans. All are equal. We are a minority in certain areas. Likewise, the Sinhalese are the minority in the Nuwara-Eliya District. All have to be treated equally. Whatever right you have, I must also have. That is our stand.� ��But, what are your proposals for a political administration?Even for delimitation, it has not been done properly in certain areas. It has to be done in a manner that our representation is also ensured. In a political body, all the parties must be represented.� ��There is a demand for greater devolution of political power�for the North and the East. What would you seek?Right from the days of my grandfather, we never asked for a separate land. We live with the majority community. We have no problem with it. We are very comfortable living with the majority community. You and I go to the same place to worship. We do business together. There may be small, small issues here and there. It isn�t worth even to talk about. As far as the Sripada pilgrimage is concerned, it has been going on harmoniously for long.� ��The visit of the Head of State of India to our area is a great thing. I must thank the present Indian High Commissioner here�How do you analyze the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the estate sector this year?We were very proud of it. He is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit us. We are people of Indian origin. Yet, we are Indians. The visit of the Head of State of India to our area is a great thing. I must thank the present Indian High Commissioner here. It was made possible because of him only. It shows how much India recognizes us.� ��Do you want to be referred to as people of Indian�origin continuously?I have to say what I am. You reveal your identity. Likewise, I have to reveal my identity. You are of Aryan origin. I am of Indian origin.� ��In terms of reconciliation, how do you view the performances of the Government?It isn�t satisfactory. It isn�t up to the expectations. People brought this Government to power with huge expectations. They haven�t beenfulfilled.� ��How is the performance in the economic front?There too, we find a lot of problems. The cost of living has affected our people very much. It is the main issue.� � �",dengue
Tourism Minister assures more concessions to industry,"2017-12-01 00:36:53							0						 				1649","In addition to the concessions granted to the tourism industry through Budget 2018, the Ministry of Tourism Development has also made other specific requests to the Finance Minister. These requests include reverting to the previous excise licensing hours, credit facilities for the trade and other concessions.�This was revealed by Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga during his address at the Institute of Hospitality Sri Lanka Branch 19th Chairman�s Black Tie Dinner on November 29th at the Colombo Hilton. While Minister Amaratunga was the Guest of Honour, British High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, James Dauris was the Chief Guest at the event.The Minister spoke at length about the many challenges the industry has faced this year and the resultant slowdown in arrival figures. �At the very start of the year, we faced the challenge of the partial airport closure which went on for four months. This was followed by devastating floods in the southern part of the country followed by the dengue epidemic which resulted in many countries issuing travel advisories. All this took its toll on the arrival figures this year. We will most likely see the same number of arrivals as last year,� he said.The minister was also optimistic about the year ahead. �After much effort we are finally seeing progress in the global marketing campaign which as the industry keeps pointing out, is long overdue. One of the issues we have had is the stringent checks and balances with regard to finance and the fact that officials don�t want to take a chance given past experience. These are practical issues that have delayed the global campaign. However the digital campaign is now ready to be implemented early next year,� the Minister explained.Focusing on another challenge, Minister Amaratunga highlighted the need for skills development and proper training for hospitality industry personnel. �It is no secret that we are facing a shortage of skilled personnel for the hospitality industry. An organisation such as the Institute of Hospitality is in a unique position to help us overcome this problem by leveraging its experience and know-how acquired through 78 years of existence and a branch network spanning over 100 countries,� he said.Minister Amaratunga called on the institution to actively contribute to the national training efforts undertaken by tourism stakeholders. �I�m aware that this is already taking place but these efforts must be extended beyond the periphery and directed towards attracting the youth in rural areas that may otherwise be lost to the industry,� he said.The Institute of Hospitality is a professional body for managers and aspiring managers working and studying in the hospitality, leisure and tourism industries. It has been playing an important role in Sri Lanka�s tourism landscapesince the early �90s. Established in the 1930s in the UK,today the Institute of Hospitality has grown in to a global authority in the hospitality business and continues to play a leading role in Sri Lanka�s evolving tourism industry.British High Commissioner James Dauris and Chairman of the Institute of Hospitality Sri Lanka Branch, Thusith Samarawickrema also spoke during the event.�",dengue

Taking a closer look at   waterborne   diseases,"2017-11-17 18:31:16							0						 				1331","With the rains comes various diseases. Speaking to the Health Capsule Prof. Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama, explained the different water borne diseases and infections that are commonly present in Sri Lanka. Such diseases can spread due to the contamination of drinking water with sewage water. He further sighted examples such as dengue, gastroenteritis, typhoid, Hepatitis A and skin rashes as the most common illnesses. �There are various parasitic diseases that can happen, but the worm infestation an amoebiosis is less because of improved conditions. Cholera too can occur, but not in Sri Lanka unless it is imported,� explained the professor.� �DengueProf. de Silva stated that one of the main diseases to watch out for during the rainy season, in the current context, is dengue. Although it is not transmitted through water it is one of the most deadly illnesses that spreads during the rainy season.� �He further explained where the disease can originate. �During the rainy season dengue can spread due to the increase in breeding sites for mosquitoes. Generally the mosquito breeds in clear water, so there are sights outside the house as well as inside such as plants and gutters where the water accumulates. Recent research has shown that the mosquito is adapting and can even breed in salt water or dirty water. However the main breeding site is still the accumulation of clear water.� he explained.� �Prof. de Silva continued to explain the symptoms that are experienced. �There will be high fever, pain behind the eyes, headaches and aches in the body. The fever can even drop and return. The main problem is when patients exert themselves. Patients should take bed rest and take paracitamol. They shouldn�t take asprin or any drugs that are used for joint pains. You should do a dengue antigen test within the first twenty four hours. Even if the test or the blood count are normal initially it is important to rest and keep checking the blood to make sure the platelet count is not dropping. Because the dengue antigen test is not 100% accurate,� he said.� �Speaking of preventive measure that should be taken the professor said, �A vaccine is being made. But there are other measures that should be taken. You must make sure the environment is clean and there are no breeding sites. The Government alone can�t do that, people also have to chip in. You must make sure that you are not bitten by mosquitoes by wearing mosquito repellant whenever you leave the house and wear long clothing, keeping skin exposure to a minimum. But the main thing is to make sure that the breeding sights are destroyed.� �Prof. de Silva went on to explain about diseases that increase due to flooding. Diseases such as gastroenteritis, typhoid and hepatitis A are transmitted through oral means.�GastroenteritisProf. de Silva explained gastroenteritis, it�s symptoms and treatment, �This is the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that involves the stomach and the small intestine. It is quite a broad term and one of the main diseases that are spread during the rainy season, especially when there is flooding. The symptoms that you can experience are abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea along with fever. If it is immediate you have to take bed rest. If there is fever and no vomiting you have to give the patient liquids like jeevani. And if there is vomiting you have to admit the patient and give him/her an IV as well. Fluids and bed rest are the main treatment options and if it is a bacterial infection antibiotics have to be given� said the professor.��Typhoid�Typhoid is a bacterial illness which is caused due to bacteria called paratyphoid and typhoid. This causes fever, headaches, abdominal pain and can even cause diarrhea. Antibiotics are prescribed as well,� explained Prof. de Silva.� �Hepatitis AProf. de Silva explained,� Hepatitis A is a viral infection which can damage the liver. A definite symptom is yellow discolouration of the eyes. Others include fever, abdominal pain and weakness. There is a vaccine that is given for this condition, in addition to bed rest and fluids that are recommended. Hepatitis B is not commonly seen in Sri Lanka,�he added.�Skin RashesSpeaking of skin conditions that can be transmitted he said,�These are mainly allergies. These are skin conditions that are developed due to muddy and contaminated water. You can develop rashes and experience itching. You must avoid contact with water, wear boots and suitable clothing. If contacted, wash it off as soon as possible. Generally it is an allergic reaction. When you develop a skin infection you can apply an antibiotic cream. Asteroid cream can be used if it is an allergy�.� �PreventionSpeaking on preventive measures that should be taken the professor said, �If there is flooding it is difficult to sort out. Consume boiled and clean water, bottled water and make sure that the water source is secure. Make sure that the food that you use is not raw and is cooked well. When you have vegetables wash and cook them. You should not have things like salads otherwise there is a higher chance of getting infected�.��",dengue
Five-day Epihack Sri Lanka event enters final day; new solutions developed,"2017-11-15 10:29:41							0						 				1051","Epihack Colombo brought together 55 experts from 11 countries all over the world to take part in the international collaborative effort spanning five days facilitating an intensive environment to develop, integrate, and improve technological solutions in order to detect and reduce the impact of dengue fever in Colombo.The event required all participants to work together and create new solutions. Epihack Sri Lanka�s final objective was to develop a cutting edge participatory reporting tool with prevention strategies to battle dengue and bridge communication gaps in dengue control. This builds on the existing Mo-Buzz mobile platform used by the public health inspectors of Colombo. Government officials, health experts, and developers from Sri Lanka and the world have been collectively brainstorming and prototyping digital tools to prevent the spread of dengue. The final prototype will represent an exciting second-generation digital surveillance tool at the frontiers of technology-based global health solutions. The digital solutions created during Epihack will be open-source and accessible to all for non-commercial use. The organizers hope to empower other stakeholders to join the fight against infectious diseases around the world.The first-ever Epihack Sri Lanka was conducted in Cinnamon Lakeside hotel. Epihack Sri Lanka was organised by Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in collaboration with Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), University of Colombo Computer Society (UCSC), and the Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL).

Following are excerpts of the interview.� ��Q:�As the Governor of the Northern Province, how do you view the demand for power sharing in this province?� �It has to be viewed taking into account the history of our country. Mainly as a result of historical events, these constitutional amendments or constitutions were brought about. For example, the 13th Amendment took place because the successive Governments in the past couldn�t resolve the problem through legislative measures. The 13th Amendment provided for the setting up of provincial councils. To a certain extent, power has been devolved to the provincial councils. People are concerned both about the stability or integrity of the country and devolution. The 13th Amendment balances both. On the one hand, there is a demand for power devolution. It�s to be done. On the other hand, integrity, unity and stability of the country are to be preserved. The President has a very important role to play. Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP, in its constitutional proposals, has requested the presidential system to be retained.�Q : Is that in the present form or with certain alterations?�That is with certain alternations. But, the presidential system should remain. We will have to consider the power of provincial governors in terms of the powers of the President. The governor is the representative of the President. The President takes charge of the powers to protect the unity of the country, to ensure that provincial law making is done according to the Constitution. As the President�s representative, my duty is to work for these two purposes.One is to make sure that the activities of the Provincial Council are carried out in accordance with the laws and the Constitution of the Country. The other is to ensure that integrity of the country is preserved. You remember that Vartharajah Perumal served as the Chief Minister of the North-East Provincial Council. He, in fact, hoisted the Eelam flag. As a result, the then President dissolved the Provincial Council. We experienced such a scenario at that time. Even today, we see some extremists trying to demand something not acceptable by the country.� ��We import salt from India. Sri Lanka is an island in the Indian Ocean. We don�t want such advanced technology to manufacture salt. An investor visited the north. He wanted to start manufacturing salt. That also encountered with multiple resistance�Q : In the north where you serve as Governor, there is a huge demand for greater power sharing. What is your experience with Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran?� �It is only a slogan so far. We can see after the constitutional reforms are introduced. Until such time, it will remain as a demand only. Political agitation is present.� �Q :�Actually, what is your experience in working with him?� �Earlier, he was a judge. Now, he is a politician. As a politician, he does what all the others do. In the absence of Wigneswaran, the others will play the same role. **He hasn�t become a hindrance to my work.� �Q:�How does he collaborate with you in the discharge of duties?� �He doesn�t have any discussion with me. For the past two years, we met only once or twice. It was only for the functional duties. I think that was regarding the appointment of provincial ministers or them taking oath. I used to meet him during certain events such as celebrations. That is all.��Q : How is it when passing statutes in his Council?� �I have brought all the statutes that were passed by the Provincial Councils in the South. That is to help him. I collected all the statutes and gave them to him for his perusal. Without statutes, the Provincial Councils aren�t empowered. Devolved power can be empowered only by passing statutes. The Northern Provincial Council has passed only eight statutes. That isn�t enough.� �Q :�Does it mean the Council has failed?� �I feel so. For the benefit of the people, in an area that was severely affected by the war, the Provincial Council should work very efficiently. The Provincial Council can act in this regard only if the statutes are passed. I think they have become a failure now.� �Q :�There is the allegation that the annual allocations are underutilized there. What is your view as the Governor?� �There was an allegation like that earlier. The Chief Minister refuted that allegation. He said he was in need of more money. What I felt is that the allotted money couldn�t be spent because of contradictions. The Iranamadu water scheme could be taken for an example. It couldn�t be implemented because of contradictory and contrasting views held by the politicians. People of Kilinochchi want to use water in the Iranamadu Tank in their area itself. They argue that there is no water in excess to be used for drinking purposes. Yet, people in Jaffna are in need of safe drinking water. The Iranamadu water project is meant to supply drinking water to Jaffna people. It has been delayed for a long time because of contradictions.� �After that, there was money allocated for an economic centre in Vavuniya. It also didn�t take off because of political tussles over its location.� �Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera allocated money for a botanical garden in the north. That was also not implemented because of differences. When private investors arrive in the north, they are disgusted.� �Q :�What is the reason for that?� There is no cooperation between them. We import salt from India. Sri Lanka is an island in the Indian Ocean. We don�t want such advanced technology to manufacture salt. An investor visited the north. He wanted to start manufacturing salt. That also encountered with multiple resistance. There were agitations too. Some argued that it would affect the fishing industry. There were others arguing that it would affect agriculture.� ���The governor is the representative of the President. The President takes charge of the powers to protect the unity of the country, to ensure that provincial law making is done according to the Constitution�The governor is the representative of the President. The President takes charge of the powers to protect the unity of the country, to ensure that provincial law making is done according to the ConstitutionQ : How will such contrasts in policies with regard to politicians affect the constitution making process then?� �These politicians are used to utter slogans for political ends, not for the economic benefit of the country. They have been urging and agitating for political gains before, after and during the war. It has become part of their political psyche even at present.� �Dengue has been controlled in other parts of the country. In Jaffna, Dengue is still raging. No action has been taken so far. No politician is interested in talking about such issues. All these local authorities come under the purview of the Chief Minister. I was the Chief Minister for ten years in the Western Province. I gave leadership to my council during that time in the greater interests of people. In the north, it isn�t happening that way.� �Q : There is a demand for the pruning of the President�s power to appoint the Provincial Governors. The demand is that it should be made mandatory for the President to consult the Chief Minister. What is your view?� �Some matters have to be attended in consultation with the Chief Minister. Otherwise, devolution won�t work. If everything is done at the discretion of the Governor it wouldn�t amount to devolution. The Chief Minister has the power. He has the elected members. The elected representatives should have the right to rule the area concerned. In appointing the Provincial Ministers, I have to consult the Chief Minister. After passing statutes, they are sent to the Governor. The Governor has to check whether they are in line with the law of the country among other things.� �Q : Yet, if the Constitution is amended enabling the appointment of the governors only with the concurrence of the Chief Minister, how will that affect?� ��Concurrence does not mean approval. There can be consultation. It is not the final say. For example, there will be two or three names proposed for the post. Then, the President can decide who is to be handpicked.� ���The Iranamadu water scheme could be taken for an example. It couldn�t be implemented because of contradictory and contrasting views held by the politicians�Q : Can the Chief Minister reject the appointment during such an instance?� �According to the proposed amendment, he can reject such an appointment politically, but not constitutionally.��Q : Does it mean the current provisions related to the appointment of provincial governors will be changed in the new Constitution?� �It will be changed. There will be consultation with the Chief Minister concerned, but things won�t happen according to his wishes. The final say remains with the President.� �Q :�What is your view on the concurrent list that outlines subjects to be shared both by the centre and the provinces?� �It�s better if we can abolish the concurrent list. Yet, there are some places where both parties should get together and take decisions. The concurrent list is very important in this instance. Sri Lanka is an island. But, it�s one unit. The provinces are there. Take for example, Mahaweli River. It flows through several provinces. If the Government wants to commence a project, it will have to consult all the authorities of the riparian provinces. The concurrent list should remain in relation to certain subject areas like that.� �I don�t hear of people being harassed by the military now. Instead, they are helping the people. The military plays a huge role in development works. They have the capacity. In the north, there aren�t enough contractors. The army fills the vacuum.�Q :�What about education as a devolved subject?� �There is no big problem as such. At the moment, within the provinces, they have power to administer the education sectors. If it�s against the national policy, a question will arise.� �Q :�How optimistic are you of this constitution making process?� �The constitutional amendments are a must.� �Q :�How strong is extremism there?�It isn�t strong. But, it seems strong in the media. Extremist views are publicized highly. That trend isn�t on the surface. Ordinary Tamil people wish to coexist peacefully.� �Q :�How do you see the demand for scaling down the military presence in the north by the Chief Minister?� �During the time of the war, we needed some military strength. The same strength isn�t needed throughout the country now. We don�t recruit personnel for the military now because there is no necessity for that. During the time of the war, we were compelled to recruit those even without basic qualifications. When they say there should be a reduction of military personnel, it is reasonable.� �If the presence of the military is an obstacle in the way of people, it is to be curtailed. We have to find out whether there are obstacles.I don�t hear of people being harassed by the military now. Instead, they are helping the people. The military plays a huge role in development works. They have the capacity. In the north, there aren�t enough contractors. The army fills the vacuum. They play a role in the eradication of Dengue. In fact, they helped when there was a blood shortage at the Jaffna Hospital. The army personnel donated their blood. Who benefited? The Tamil people benefited.�There is a reluctance among Tamil people to donate blood.The Sinhalese are used to donate blood.� ��Yet, people in Jaffna are in need of safe drinking water. The Iranamadu water project is meant to supply drinking water to Jaffna people. It has been delayed for a long time because of contradictions.� �After that, there was money allocated for an economic centre in Vavuniya. It also didn�t take off because of political tussles over its location.� �Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera allocated money for a botanical garden in the north. That was also not implemented because of differences�Q :�Is it because of a caste issue, which was reported in the media earlier?� �The caste issue is strong there. In fact, the caste factor is accepted by the religion, culture and tradition of that society. That is the biggest problem. According to our system, the caste system isn�t approved. Yet, it is in practice even within the Sasana (Buddhist clergy). In Hinduism, it is accepted. It is very serious.� �Q :�How has it affected public life there?� �One thing is blood transfusion. We see the segregation when it comes to the use of burial grounds. There is demand for separate playgrounds due to the presence of the caste issue. Villages are also segregated according to the caste system.��Q :�Is it becoming like in India?� �Yes. There is no legal recognition though.��Q :�Has it hampered development work?� �It will affect even the economic activities. Land owners are mostly high caste people. The others don�t have land. High caste people don�t live in Sri Lanka now. They are in the South or outside the country.���",dengue

Govt. will go through a process of self criticism,"2017-10-31 09:20:08							16						 				2959","The government will go through a process of self criticism in order to determine where it went wrong and rectify whatever shortcomings, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.The Prime Minister made this remark after releasing a report on the government's achievements during the past two years.Mr Wickremesinghe said the government has not been able to secure a 5.5 per cent economic growth it expected to achieve as a result of floods, drought, Kolonnawa incident and dengue during the year.However he said changes brought about in the economy had endured an economic growth of 4.5 percent. "" Country would have ended up with a 2.5 percent growth if not for economic reforms brought about by the government' he said.He said any party from any part of the world was welcome to buy over a stake of the Trincomalee Port. �One should remember that the Trincomalee Port is going to play a major role in the region soon. The Indian Ocean is going to be a region which will have a vast growth and Trincomalee has to be a part of it"" he said. At the same time he said Sri Lanka will have to work with India as the subcontinent will account for 40 of the growth of the Indian Ocean' the Prime Minister said.Responding to the criticism that this government has failed to bring in infrastructure development as the previous regime did, the Prime Minister said this government does not intend to burden the people with more debt. ""We don't want to dump money like the previous regime but will go on with developing after securing the economy"" he said.""The economy is central to every thing we have achieved. Without a strong economy we would not have been able to build houses, ensure that working people are getting decent wages. The progress report we put out today very clearly states that Sri Lanka is on the right track towards a better future ' he added.

Dengue  strikes  again!,"2017-10-31 00:43:23							0						 				1643","Tightening our belts before�The threat of Dengue is a dark shadow looming in the Sri Lankan horizons, waiting to strike as soon as an opportunity presents itself. At the time of writing as many as 162952 cases of dengue have been reported; an all time high. Though the number of dengue patients has been declining since the end of July, as per the data provided by the Epidemiology Unit, the public have raised their suspicions regarding this figure because they feel it can rise given the wet weather experienced in most parts of the country. The Daily Mirror contacted Dr. Prachila Samaraweera of the National Dengue Control Unit to clear the doubts regarding the magnitude of the threats associated with the rise in dengue.� ��Yes, we have identified a slight possibility of an increase in dengue in the coming few weeks, with the rain favouring the breeding of the mosquito. We are currently taking action to minimize the spread of the disease in areas which are at a higher risk. For an example, we carried out dengue prevention programmes in Jaffna following an increased number of patients and we�ve had less patients being reported afterwards,� she replied.� �Samaraweera also said that the authorities have observed an increase in Dengue cases around this time of the year in previous years as well. The data obtained from the Epidemiology Unit, showing the spread of Dengue cases throughout the year over the past few years also reveals that even though the highest number of cases is reported around 25-30 week of the year, there is a slight peak after around 42 weeks.� �two monsoon seasonsTo quote the research paper published in 2017 on the �Effect of Climatic Factors and Population Density on the Distribution of Dengue in Sri Lanka�, by P.D.N.N. Sirisena and the others, �With two monsoon seasons in Sri Lanka, the absolute number of dengue and severe Dengue cases peak twice annually. The first peak occurs in June/July that coincides with the South Western monsoon due to the rainfall that starts in April. The second peak occurs between the end of the year and early January next year which is associated with the North Eastern monsoon that occurs from October to December�. This also indicates a possibility of an oncoming rise in Dengue cases.� ��After the epidemic proportion dengue outbreak that we experienced during the middle of the year, being aware of a possibility of Dengue making a significant comeback is of utmost importance. By anticipating the event, we can be better prepared, thus minimizing it�s damage. What can we do to prepare for this challenge?� �� Always be alert, and watch out for possible mosquito breeding places during this rainy season,� cautioned Dr. Samaraweera. She also advised to give special attention to work places and schools, as well as residences and the surroundings, since these are the places where one spends most of the time during the day.���As most of our readers are already aware of, contracting of Dengue needs fulfilling of three criteria. First, there should be a carrier, who has the Dengue virus in his bloodstream. Then there should be the mosquito that can transmit the virus by first biting the carrier and getting the infected blood into its body. The third criterion is for the infected mosquito to bite a healthy uninfected person, releasing the virus into his or her bloodstream.� �detecting an outbreakWhen it comes to the prevention of dengue, in addition to destroying the mosquito breeding grounds, it�s important to prevent the mosquitoes from getting infected from the diseased carriers, so that they can�t spread the disease further, said Dr. Hasitha Udalagama, Resident House Officer at the Base Hospital Nikaweratiya. �The best thing to do is being alert about fever in endemic areas, thereby enabling early detection. When a patient is identified with a certain community (village, scheme, street, work place etc.), measures should be taken to limit the transmission from that person. These measures include keeping that person inside a net for about 5 days, using repellents and taking other measures to prevent mosquito bites in the neighbourhood and eliminating breeding sites. Reporting the cases (notification by health professionals) is vital in detecting an outbreak,� he further explained.� �The objective of this article is not to unduly alarm our readers with a dire warning of an impending threat of Dengue. Rain is only one factor amongst many that contributes to the rise in Dengue cases. When it comes to the spread of Dengue many other external factors like temperature, humidity and urbanization have been found to positively correlate with the spread of Dengue. Therefore, with so many factors contributing to the disease, no one can predict exactly what would happen in the future regarding the dengue situation. Does this mean that we should cross our arms and allow fate to decide when disaster should strike next? We should not forget that among the uncontrollable things like rains or the winds, there are modifiable factors. These things which are under the control of the average human like you and I have the greatest impact on the spread of Dengue. By reducing mosquito breeding grounds and by minimizing the spread of the disease through the carriers, we can lessen the impact of the demon waiting to strike. In other words, we may not prevent the hazard, but by being prepared and working together, we can certainly impede it�s progression towards disaster.� ��",dengue

Dengue has always been amongst the deadliest diseases we face in Sri Lanka. And Epihack Sri Lanka aims to stop it.Epihack is described as, a �five-day hackathon bringing together public health professionals, IT developers, IT designers and government officials to create an open source digital solution to health communication and surveillance of dengue fever with the hope of reducing the disease�.However, this is different from the typical hackathons we see. This is a hackathon that encourages collaboration rather than competition. Thus, all the teams work together to build a sustainable solution, and it�s not just IT developers that collaborate together. Epihack also invites health professionals to participate in the process.It�s also a global event that�s been held in various countries. Some examples are Tanzania, Myanmar, Albania, Brazil, Thailand, Laos and more. Now, it�s coming to Sri Lanka on 6th November 2017.The goal of Epihack is to not only develop prototypes but also ensure they bring about sustainable outcomes. This is why they invite both technology and health professionals along with other stakeholders. One project is �Guardians of Health� by Epitrack, which came about after Epihack Rio 2015. This was an app used to detect public health emergencies and outbreaks. It utilized crowd-sourced reports to monitor symptoms and health conditions in different areas. Three years later, Epitrack has expanded into a young startup and launched a new app called �Flu Near You!� to track and fight the flu.Another project is Afyadata from Epihack Tanzania in 2014. This was built by the Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS). It�s used to collect, submit, receive and/or track feedback of health data.

Are the people of Colombo North subhumans?,"2017-09-26 01:39:14							3						 				2833","�It�s with utmost distress that I write this letter to your esteemed newspaper with the hope that it will catch the attention of the rulers, who seem to treat the people of Colombo North as �sub-human beings�. Indeed there is no one to hear the painful stories of the distraught masses, where the poorest of the poor live and die. I have lived in this part of the city for over 60 years and things have never been so wretched �Let me only point out some glaring debacles:� �1. The road starting from Tobacco Company Junction at Kotahena and going along Aluthmawatha is being dug-up for several months by a company involved in the Water Supply Project. It seems that this company lacks competence to avoid setting off several major and minor leaks all along, of which the Water Board doesn�t care a copper cent. So, the good, drinkable water streams, down the roadway, turn the place into a mud hole and cause a great wastage which we citizens have to pay for ultimately. This tragedy has befallen several roads in Kotahena, Mutwal and Mattakkuliya. Further, deep wells have been dug along Aluthmawatha Road, St. James Street, Walls Lane, Madampitiya Road etc. and those involved in the work seem quite helpless and clueless. The areas have become veritable death traps with totally devastated road surfaces. The Mattakkuliya-Farm Road Junction is in a mighty mess with leaks everywhere. Leaks have sprung up in several well-laid roads about which the digging sub-contractors and the Water Board care the least. �2. Indeed such widespread water collection spots (clean water) make a cruel mockery of the Government�s much proclaimed Anti-Dengue Campaign. �3. Rarely do the Water Board workers (looking pathetically incompetent) try to patch up the one or two leaks after months of disrepair. They dig and then discard the remaining excavated sand and tarred blocks blissfully onto the pavement and vanish (St. Mary�s Road/Centre Road Section). Or, they dump the stuff at the entrances to the by-lanes.�Farm Road�Leaks have sprung up in several well-laid roads about which the digging sub-contractors and the Water Board care the least�4. Just travel along Aluthmawatha Road or several other roads in Colombo North. The �dug out� sand, stone and other debris are thrown along the pavements giving rise to enormous dust clouds, seriously polluting the breathable air - making everyone suffer from eye, throat and chest problems. �5. Now comes the stunner! The Electricity Board too has been engaged in the digging done with a vengeance with scant regard for what lies underneath. The result is that, all along the roads, pipelines are broken, sending out gallons of precious water. These �rivers� then flow for several days, at times for weeks, until the Water Board sends its nondescript team. It seems that the Electricity Board is readily absolved of their wanton destruction. �6. Samata Sarana is a school and a home to 400 inmates from pre-school kids to very elderly people. The disaster is hellishly apparent opposite this great institution, which was once visited by Secretary Hilary Clinton. The children and the elderly have to wade through mud holes or walk along bathed in dirt and dust. Thus, we see the numb rules treating these helpless citizens like sewage rats. �7. One positive aspect of �our benevolent rulers� is the modernized roadway which was commissioned from Mattakkuliya Farm Road, along Centre Road, stretching for 1km or more. The company that carried out this mega project should be complemented. All lamp posts are ready for use. For more than a year now this road remains unlit. Is this a dark side of efficiency? �8. My plea to the rulers is this; follow the example of Patali Champika Ranawake, on behalf of the hapless people of Colombo North. Tie up your shoe laces and walk along the roads and lanes of this part of the city. You can transform the tragedy that has been highlighted, into a resounding victory within a week; as the Ranawake did. But with the shabby mind set of the rest from top to bottom the much hyped dream of a megapolis will only end up as a Necropolis (a place where dead people are buried). To translate the ideas of a megapolis to reality, technical and managerial competence backed by a sincere political is a �sine qua non�. ��Aluthmawatha Road�So, the good, drinkable water streams, down the roadway, turn the place into a mud hole and cause a great wastage which we citizens have to pay for?��9. People witnessing these unfolding and increasing disasters in the North of the city, as never seen before post independence incidents, would like to know whether there are subject Ministers assigned to each of the failed and failing Boards, Local Bodies and Departments (including the Environmental Police) to ensure that there is - some semblance of governance leaving aside the much hyped �Good Governance�?�10.

It will discuss how to advance the contribution of tourism to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and define the actions of the Organization for the period 2018-2019.�Sri Lanka is being represented at this meeting by the Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga who was bestowed with the honour of being elected as a vice chair of the UNWTO General Assembly by the Committee on South Asia. �This appointment shows the recognition that Sri Lanka has gained as an upcoming tourism destination. It will help me to portray Sri Lanka and its unique attractions to the leaders of world tourism. It is indeed an honour and I will leverage this appointment to put Sri Lanka in the world tourism spotlight,� said Minister Amaratunga. Sri Lanka Tourism has fought multiple battles throughout this year starting from the airport closure for four months, to the devastating floods in the south to the garbage crisis followed by the dengue issue, all of which have been negatively highlighted by the�international media.��These unfortunate events which were beyond our control have obviously had a negative impact on arrivals this year and it is only now that there is a conducive environment for inbound tourism.�Despite all this it is indeed reassuring that arrivals are beginning to pick up once again and we are very confident of achieving our targets for this year,� noted Minister Amaratunga, adding �I hope there will not be any other disruptions in the next�four months.� Meanwhile Secretary-General, World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) Dr. Taleb Rifai, described the 22nd UNWTO General Assembly as a �A unique opportunity to get the sector united towards the common goal of making tourism a true driver of sustainable development.��Minister Amaratunga was also a panelist on the high-level debate on tourism and SDGs. A special session on smart tourism, the celebrations of the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development 2017, the conversion of the UNWTO Global Code of Ethics into an international Convention and current trends of the tourism sector are included in the agenda of the 22nd session of the UNWTO General Assembly. The Assembly will also discuss an action plan and key priorities of the Organization for the next�two years.",dengue
Hemas Wattala offers top level care against dengue for high risk pregnancies,"2017-09-13 11:11:28							0						 				278","�Among the 2,000 plus dengue patients treated at Hemas Hospital Wattala in the past three months, several critical cases were high risk pregnancies that got even more complex as the patients advanced in their pregnancies having contracted the dengue virus.One such case was of a pregnant female who had abandoned the idea that she would one day become a mother. Her past health history of three miscarriages, pregnancy induced hypertension and diabetes, hypo thyroidism plus a rare blood disorder called �Factor Eight�, contributed to her being warned medically that the likelihood of her ever carrying a baby to term - was slim. At 35 years of age, considered �elderly primal� was not in her favour, however desperate she was to have a child. So when she discovered she was pregnant for the fourth time, she was anxious that this should be a viable pregnancy.Dr. Indra Wadinambiarachchi at the Out Patient Department (OPD) at Hemas Hospitals, immediately suspected dengue and prescribed the dengue antigen test, on a routine visit of another patient who at 36 weeks pregnancy complained of a mild sore throat and fever. She was surprised when diagnosed as having dengue, particularly since a test done a few days prior at a neighborhood laboratory had told her other-wise.Both pregnancies, considered very high-risk, highly complicated and very rare, became the responsibility of the team of medical and healthcare specialists at Hemas Hospital in Wattala.�Dengue plus at the advanced stage of eight months of pregnancy and a pregnant woman with acute blood disorder plus other complications who had contracted dengue, was the challenge that the team had to manage - the health of the mother and her baby.As the mothers recovered from their delivery, Dr. Rasika Herath, Consultant Gynaecologist discussed how serious their conditions were. All necessary investigations were carried out without any delays, with Consultant Haemotologist, Dr. Visakha Ratnamalala also part of the team that supervised the delivery. �From the ward doctor to the Consultants � Gynae, Heamotolgy, Paediatric were present at the times of delivery, given that one patient had a legacy of acute blood disorder and the other having a low platelet count, high pulse rate and fluid leakage caused by acute dengue. Both situations were near fatal.Dr. Sunil Fernando, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist also worked tirelessly and meticulously in planning the care of a number of pregnant women who were diagnosed with dengue, over the past few months.�Our experienced team of maternal-fetal healthcare specialists, in collaboration and with direction from the consultants, ensured safe and effective perinatal and post natal care� explained Hemas Hospital Wattala Medical Services Manager Dr. Upul Ilangasinghe.�Often, patients are simply monitored more carefully while their pregnancy proceeds normally,� he continued. �However, in these two critical cases and in most times, our team was able to quickly diagnose, prescribe the specific tests, treatments and courses of action and developed an effective care plan that suited the mother�s specific needs, and offered the best chance of a successful outcome�.Dr. Ilangasinghe concluded that timely diagnosis is an attribute of experience which is the key driver to the successes at Hemas Hospitals. �From the OPD to the ward doctors, the respective consultants, from the pool of over 200 consultants that see patients at Hemas Hospitals, to the teams of nurses, paramedics and all hospital staff, stay committed to the most successful healthcare practices and outcomes,� he summed up.Hemas Wattala Director/General Manger Dr. Lasantha Karunasekara stated: �This amply demonstrates the commitment, dedication, skill and passion of the entire hospital team, from consultants down, towards the patients visiting Hemas Hospitals. Managing high risk patients across all specialties with great outcomes have become a routine to our staff now. As the only hospitals in the region with international accreditation following stringent patient centric processes, including a world standard central supply sterilizing unit, contributing to almost zero infection rates to surgery, has all contributed to the our�success journey.��",dengue
There weren�t enough tears to wash away all the sorrow,"2017-09-09 00:00:25							0						 				1145","A good father is one of the most unsung, unpraised, unnoticed and yet one of the most valuable assets in our society�- Billy GrahamWhen I was entrusted with the task of writing in memoriam of my father, I wondered if I would be able to do this wonderful person justice as to me it seemed impossible to sum up the remembrance of him to a few paragraphs.�I doubted I would be able to contain all the emotions I was trying so hard to bottle up and get on with life; for in a society such as ours what choice do we have. Due to this reason I kept coming up with excuses to postpone the task and tried to justify it to my mother.�However, it dawned upon me one night while I was reminiscing my wonderful childhood and the years gone by, that postponing this further was a lapse on my part, no matter what the reason behind it was.�On the 5th of June this year my beloved father bade us farewell. There aren�t enough tears that could wash away all the sorrow that overcomes me when I realise that such a wonderful human being and the back bone of our family is no more.Hailing from a middle class family Leslie Sherington Wickramasinghe was born on the January 14, 1943 to Pudias Wickramasinghe, a Station Master during the British Colonial Era and Nancy Wickramasinghe.�He was the eighth child in a family of ten and the seventh son. Despite losing his father at the tender age of three and a childhood that saw its share of hardship, he was never one to give up in life. A trait he carried successfully till the end of his days.�As the youngest child in the family I knew my father to be a strong, multi-talented and successful man who was well established; a hero to many and an individual highly respected by all.�I did not see his initial struggles in life nor the hardships he faced supporting a wife and two young daughters while climbing the ladder, earning respect and a good reputation because of the precision in his work and dedication. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a father like him not only because he was a brilliant Surgeon who worked with great devotion to his cause in saving lives and ensuring his patients received his undivided care but also because as a father he gave us an upbringing which kept us in touch with reality, taught us the value of earning our accomplishments and the importance of taking responsibility for our actions.�He always told us that money is not everything and that integrity and respect earned in society outweighed all material riches.If he did not approve of something he never hesitated to express it and if someone had disappointed or betrayed his trust he did not feel the need to hide his dissatisfaction. He was a man of generally good judgement and although we failed to see it then, his judgement on good or bad affiliations have proved to be of great accuracy to this day.�No matter whom it was or how a person had wronged him; there was never a day I heard him say that anyone deserved whatever wrong had come upon them. He was not a revengeful man and believed that natural justice would take its course. Being an extremely devoted son he never neglected his duties towards his mother and carried a deep sense of gratitude and love towards her to his last days.If there ever was a reason that could create an enemy out of my father; it was an attempt to harm his family. He was our defender and our protector.After retirement and away from the stress of service at the National Hospital we began to see a much more laid back and relaxed side to my strict disciplinarian father. He began to really enjoy life and it was a great disappointment when he suffered a fall resulting in a fracture in 2008.�I will never forget the look of concern and worry in his eyes on his way to the hospital and although he said very little, his expression was easy to read for those who knew him well enough.�That was a turning point and from then on it was with extreme difficulty that we watched the once active and energetic man gradually slow down over the years. He was however a fighter and through many medical ups and downs managed to recover even when some medical experts seemed to give up hope.�He was a great example of someone who loved life despite whatever the situation and never lost the will to live, no matter what obstacles life threw his way. Even in the hardest of times his was a spirit that could not be broken.He would wait eagerly every evening for me to get back home after work and never ran out of topics to exchange information with me, be it regarding politics, current affairs or our mutual love of music.He would give me his opinion on all life�s decisions and advise me in the best way possible. Rest assured, most of that advice has proved to be the most sensible advice I have ever received.On the Wednesday before he was hospitalized, I came home after work and after having our usual evening chat he told me that I don�t hug him anymore like I used to. I hugged him tight and neither of us had to say a word. It was as if time stood still. We had both fallen asleep and I woke up about an hour later to find him asleep hugging me tight.He was rushed to hospital on Monday morning and was back to normal within a few hours. We were told he could be discharged in the evening. The consultants� follow up inspection did not happen till two days later and the days that followed are probably the worst and most traumatic days in my life and those I avoid looking back on.This task entrusted was indeed one that I hoped I would never have to face. It is one that given the choice, each and every one of us would avoid till the end of our days. However, as time flies by we have to face the inevitable truth. Those we love will one day part from us.My father was a man who left his mark on the world. He was an asset to our country and to his profession. His service was always tireless. Especially during the 90s, when Sri Lanka was severely affected by the civil war and many bomb blasts. Efforts towards ensuring that those affected were given prompt and the best care possible remained his priority. His care didn�t stop at the hospital and he managed to save me and restore me back to health while keeping me in the comfort of our home when I fell victim to dengue fever.�Time revealed that his role as a husband and father and his responsibilities towards his family which he never neglected were those that were most appreciated. This also carried a valuable lesson for every one of us.�When he left us that day, he left behind a family that will carry him in their hearts and grieve his loss till the end of their days.-Beloved daughter Sheahana Wickramasinghe",dengue
Dengue Killer and Maduruthala Dhoopa hit market chasing away mosquitoes�,"2017-09-06 11:06:30							1						 				588","�Two fine solutions to provide protection from the dengue epidemic that has hit hard Sri Lanka bringing about the highest death rate recently, have been introduced to the market by Irahanda Weda Gedara.�Dengue Killer� spray consisting of essence of �Pangiri� and �Sera� can be purchased from the island wide super markets now. As many current mosquito repellent lotions are chemical-based, they tend to cause skin cancer. Enriched with a pleasant fragrance of sera, Dengue Killer based on natural essence of sera and pangiri has been introduced to by Irahanda Weda Gedara which has secured the customers� trust for many decades in order to impose a practical remedy on such a harmful factor. Apart from its major function of overthrowing the threat of mosquitoes, Dengue Killer avails itself of its capacity to destroy germs.��Maduruthala Dhoopa�, the anti-mosquito product is the second solution invented by Irahanda family to prevent one from facing the dengue catastrophe. Maduruthala Dhoopa, designed to attack mosquitoes, is manufactured using �Heen Maduruthala� which is known as �Thulsi� in India and which was used to repel mosquitoes by the traditional Sri Lankans for generations. It can banish not only dengue, but also all other mosquitoes. This is a plant dedicated in the name of the god, and the daily use will dismiss all the harmful effects inside the house. As the anti-mosquito Maduruthala Dhoopa is solely produced with leaves of �Heen Maduruthala�, it contains no poisoning on the human body. Therefore, it can be safely applied even in a context involving children without any risk unlike other mosquito coils found in general market.",dengue
Sri Lanka Police marks the 151st anniversary,"2017-09-04 01:43:54							0						 				1358","September 3 was the historic day, on which Police was formally established in the isle of Sri Lanka. When making reference to the world history in relation to Police, Sri Lanka Police history is considered as one of the longest. Sir Robert Peel, who is known as the father of Modern Policing, established the Metropolitan Police in England in 1829 and it is considered as the first formally established Police in the world. 37 years after its establishment, Sri Lanka Police was established in 1866 as per the Ordinance No. 16 of 1865 and today marks its 151st anniversary.� ""Police University will be established in order to obtain higher education on Police Science and Criminal Justice ""�A systematically evolving Policing method can be observed in every developed society. The chronicles of Mahawamsa also records that during the reign of King Pandukabhaya (437 - 367 B.C.), there had been a position named, �Nagara Guththika�, which had similar duties of Police even under the monarchical system of ancient Lanka.Further, the establishment of a rural administrative system and building the city of Anuradhapura as the administrative centre had begun during the same period. Later on, various kings took measures to maintain order among the citizens and it has been recorded in the history that King Udaya II (887 - 898 A.D.) had established a proper Gamsabha system. ��The Police Service was informally established in Sri Lanka by the British as a means of providing a security measure through patrolling for ensuring safety of the warehouses of Colombo harbour in 1795. Later on, the need for a formal Police service came up both due to the inadequacy of the prevailing Police Vidhane system to prevent various picaresque acts and due to various appeals made by the public officers highlighting the importance of a proper Police service. ��Consequently, Sri Lanka Police Service was informally established around 1832, subsequent to the division of Colombo area into 15 Police zones and the attachment of 10 Police Sergeants, 05 Police Constables and 150 peons. Afterwards, Police stations had been established in other areas such as, Galle, Negombo and Kandy. ��As the first Sri Lankan Superintendent of Police, Mr. Lokubanda Dunuwila, who was holding office as Uva Disawe at the time, was appointed the Superintendent of Police in Kandy. After the official establishment of the Police Service as per the Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, G. W. R. Campbell, the Chief Superintendent of Police, was appointed the first Inspector General of Police and the appointment of Sir Richard Aluwihare the first Sri Lankan Inspector General of Police in 1947 is a turning point in the history of Police. He has rendered an immense service towards the endurance of Police and the welfare of Police Officers. �The first incident of sacrificing a life by a Police officer, while he was on duty for maintaining law and order, had occurred at Uthuwankanda, Mawanella on Monday, 21stMarch, 1864. ��While conducting an operation carried out to arrest a suspect named, Deekirikevage Saradiel, the Police officer named Sabhan was shot by another suspect, Mammale Marikkar and had faced death in a brave manner. ��Through the establishment of an organised Police Service after adopting the Police Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, it becomes evident that the commencement of maintaining the register of Police war heroes had helped the establishment of an organised policing method. ��It can be mentioned with pride that Sri Lanka Police is the leading institution for protecting Law & Order among the oldest public institutions in Sri Lanka. ��With profound respect, we should commemorate the demise of 3,117 Police officers, who had valiantly sacrificed their lives for ensuring the safety of lives and property of the public and the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. �		September 3 was the historic day, on which Police was formally established in the isle of Sri Lanka.�			Sri Lanka Police was established in 1866 as per the Ordinance No. 16 of 1865�			The first Sri Lankan Superintendent of Police was Lokubanda Dunuwila�			G.

It has been recorded in history that the Martial Law had been first imposed on Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces by the then Government and that power had been delegated to the Police to provide security. ��Further, the Police had performed their duty to minimise the loss of lives and property with minimum facilities and strength during many violent situations erupted before the period (1948-1971) of forming of Sri Lankan Republic.During this time, the first Woman Police Constable was killed and it is worth commemorating the demise of 15 female officers, who sacrificed their lives during the war against terrorism. �In addition to that, Sri Lanka Police had fought at the risk of their lives together with tri forces for the territorial integrity of the motherland during the thirty years of war with terrorism and internal tensions that had erupted in the southern area of the island. �The Sri Lankan Police which serves � 24 hours to protect lives and property of each and every citizen consists of about 87,000 officers and 484 Police Stations. ��Expeditious steps are being taken to increase this organisational structure to 600 functional Police Stations. Special attention has been given by the government under the leadership the of President, Prime Minister, Minister of Law & Order and Inspector General of Police in this regard. �The Sri Lanka Police, which faced significant challenges during the most recent 50 years out of its 150 year period, have also achieved innumerable victories. Specially, during the time of war and post-war period, combating crimes had been carried out successfully. ���Apart from the above, it is one of the responsibilities of Police to contribute to the duties performed by the other public institutes.�Furthermore, new targets have been set for achieving the development of public welfare. Accordingly, ��	�	It is expected to increase the current trend of solving property crimes. ��	Adopting new technology for analysing circumstantial evidence. �	Getting fingerprint comparison results within a short period of time using a fully automated computer programme. �	Computer programmes which have been designed to analyse criminal reports would help achieve this target. ��	Arrangements have been made to bring down the number of fatal accidents and severe property damage further by 10%. To achieve this target, �	�	Paying more attention to preventing road accidents, especially in sparsely populated areas. ��	Measures are taken to conduct traffic management duties by having constant vigilance by the side of main roads and byroads which have been developed. ��	Priority lines to promote public transport are expected to be introduced to reduce road traffic and accidents. ��""Police serves 24 hours a day to protect every citizen consists of about 87,000 officers and 484 Police Stations...""

To achieve this target, �	Establishing a Special Police Division and continually carrying out operations for the prevention of narcotics by coordinating with the other relevant government institutions. ��	Directing those who are addicted towards rehabilitation. �	Eradicating the use of tobacco products. ����	The programme of establishing mobile Police stations named �Gamata Policiya� had been implemented covering a period of one month, enabling the public to receive services from the Police easily. Concurrently, Police officers had rendered their services to implement the programmes with the village community under the themes of religious, educational, cultural, health, sports and public affairs. During such events, steps had been taken to make an enormous contribution to environmental protection for idyllic surroundings and to provide constant contribution to eradicate dengue.	�	Steps have been taken to provide speedy solutions to the problems that the Police officer had been facing for a long period of time.

Majority  voices approval  as a nation prepares to drop nondegradables,"2017-09-01 00:03:43							2						 				1335","Polythene has become a big part of our lifestyle in the recent past. If you were to walk in to any Sri Lankan household there is a high chance that you would find a bag filled with polythene bags in the kitchen; a sight that many of us are familiar with.�The shopping bags we get are often used to help us carry things.If you were to visit a company lunchroom during the lunch hour you would most probably see employees unwrapping their lunch sheets or opening rigifoam boxes before they tuck in to the rice and curry within. So when the Government announces that polythene lunch sheets, rigifoam boxes and shopping bags are to be banned from September 1, one would expect that it would be quite difficult to get rid of something that has become such a reliable, dependant and almost essential part of our lives. Thus The Daily Mirror set out and spoke to pedestrians going about their day to inquire about how prepared they are for the polythene ban. What we found out was that although people thought the reduction of the use of polythene is a good step taken, the alternatives that are available at present are insufficient to non-existent. Many of them aired the view that it is the Government�s duty to ensure that more environmentally friendly alternatives be made available in the market. ���A correction needs to be made regarding the situation we face�-Viraj Priyan (35) RagamaIt�s obviously a good thing to ban polythene and there are alternatives such as paper. We would have had to do this.We have to rectify the situation that has culminated to what it is today. But we have to use the correct process and there has to be a proper plan. Where I come from, the garbage isn�t collected nor is it put on a side. Right now there isn�t a proper system in place.In addition to this, polythene is a big industry and generates a lot of money. I myself was in this industry. In the recent past we have started to collect plastic and polythene and put it through a process of recycling.You observe in bus halts and train stations how plastic and polythene items, that are thrown away, have accumulated.This is because there is no place to dispose them. Steps to reduce the use of such items should have been taken earlier. If this was done there wouldn�t have been such a problem. After observing the issues associated with the polythene and plastic, I stopped working in the industry recently and found employment as a PLC.���Plastic was something that came recently, we didn�t have it those days.- Dhiyawansa (57) ColomboIt�s a real problem and a nuisance to prepare for such a thing. Because there is no place to keep the plastic. Sometimes it isn�t collected, so some of us end up burning it although it is very harmful to the environment.Those days this problem didn�t exist because we never used polythene. We used paper, cloth and other decomposable material. Polythene is a recent product and it has caused so many problems for us and the environment. �������It is a good practice to stop using polythene��-Rohana (35) Nuwara EliyaIt would be a good practice to stop using polythene. As of now, people are just throwing their trash on the road.Nowadays you don�t see people maintaining discipline; they are just throwing their rice packets and lunch sheets on to the road. Then the garbage collects in mounds and contributes to the spread of dengue.Practically we don�t see any alternatives to the issue right now.�������There isn�t a problem because I have other options at my disposal�-Ahmed (47) MalwanaI am more or less prepared for this because there are other things you can use such as cloth, papers and banana leaves.All these are decomposable things. For me there is no problem. ����������Our country can benefit from this�-Rohitha Perera (49) PanaduraIt is a good move. There are other alternatives such as paper and other decomposable materials that we can use. This is something that our country needs. It isn�t only for the Government, it is good for all of us.���������There aren�t any immediate alternatives that are available at the moment�-Chamika (35)�MOUNT LAVINIAThis is a really important step taken especially for our country. The problem is that the availability of lunch sheets and shopping bags is so high that it has become a part of our lifestyle. However alternatives like lunch boxes and hotpots aren�t widely available.There are very few alternatives available to us. A few days ago I went to buy one of those lunchboxes, but I couldn�t find a proper one. And to carry that around is another problem. You can even use banana leaves, but are these leaves available everywhere? I am not well prepared for this, but we will have to be prepared when the time comes.�����Practical problems can surface from what is viewed as a good solution�-Jeevani Fernando (32) MoratuwaThe main problem is the absence of a proper way to recycle plastic. �There is no solution for this main problem.And practically speaking there are no alternatives. We will have to move to things like banana leaves and cloth bags, but are those things so easy to find? I�m not prepared for this change.There are so many practical problems that come with this. And to carry lunch boxes and lunch baskets along with our handbags is another issue for us. It is a good step, but the change brings along with it a fair share of problems.����",dengue
Build climate-resilient health systems,"2017-09-01 00:00:59							0						 				1293","They must adapt to rising global temperatures�Climate change is happening. In recent years average temperatures across the globe have increased, with significant impact on humanity�s most precious resource � the environment. Water systems are under stress. Food sources are being imperilled. And areas once considered safe for settlement are being threatened and erased. ��The implications for human health are many. Climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods, exacerbating almost all public health risks, from food-borne disease to malnutrition and heatstroke. It impacts the spread and abundance of disease-carrying vectors such as mosquitoes threatening the re-emergence of once-prevalent illnesses from scrub typhus to dengue. And it can create a range of outcomes that compromise public health in one way or another: Rising sea levels or prolonged drought can displace communities; scarce resources can trigger instability and conflict; and a decline in agricultural output can aggravate and entrench poverty. ��The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the South-East Asia Region is particularly vulnerable. In recent years the Region�s 11-Member countries � all of them low- or middle-income � have faced public health challenges from diverse climate-associated events and processes, including glacial lake-outburst floods, cyclones and rapidly eroding coastlines. These and other phenomena are likely to be exacerbated as global temperatures rise. Economic losses associated with climate change, meanwhile, are already affecting the development aspirations of millions of people Region-wide, and with it their ability to secure health and well-being. As the Sustainable Development Goals emphasize, health, both determines and is determined by poverty and its attendant conditions. ��Though the problem of halting and reversing climate change is bigger than any one country, mitigating its health-related impact is both possible and necessary for all. Across the Region, health systems should be able to anticipate, respond to, cope with, recover from and adapt to climate-related shocks and stresses and do so in a way that advances health equity and ensures that no one is left behind. There are several ways to do this. ��Most critical is maintaining high-level awareness and resolve to take action. In each of the Region�s Member-countries health authorities should be fully cognizant of the specific climate-associated health risks they face and draft national plans accordingly. At the same time, cross-sectoral collaboration should be established with a range of key ministries, ensuring climate-associated health concerns are addressed across diverse policy areas. ��Climate change is already transforming life as we know it, and will continue to do so as global warming advancesHealth systems� service delivery should likewise be evaluated and augmented. This could include integrating meteorological information with climate-sensitive health programmes to better anticipate shifting disease burdens. It could include enhancing disaster risk reduction and emergency preparedness to better manage the threat of extreme weather events. And it could also include scaling up the technical and professional capacity of health workers to better prepare for and deal with climate change�s health-related outcomes. ��Climate-resilient infrastructure and technology has much to offer. All health facilities, for example, should have contingency plans to ensure essential services such as water, sanitation and electricity are maintained during extreme weather events. Similarly, new facilities should be planned, sited and built as per projected climate risks such as storm surges or cyclones. Technologies that provide early warning of extreme weather events should be integrated into emergency preparedness systems, while mobile communications that can reach appropriate audiences should be obtained and utilized. ��To facilitate these investments, climate and health financing should be adequately assessed, mobilized and secured. This means looking for opportunities to integrate the principles of climate resilience into everyday health system strengthening, whether related to health personnel or basic infrastructure. It also means identifying and accessing funding that can build resilience through more targeted initiatives such as expanding surveillance or retrofitting health facilities. ��Similarly, new facilities should be planned, sited and built as per projected climate risks such as storm surges or cyclonesMember countries across the South-East Asia Region are working to make this happen. In recent years a range of innovative measures have been implemented Region-wide to protect and improve health as climate change takes effect. This must continue. It must also be scaled up. WHO South-East Asia Region is committed to facilitating this process, and ensuring Member countries across the Region are able to cope with one of humanity�s greatest challenges. ��There is, after all, no other option. Climate change is already transforming life as we know it, and will continue to do so as global warming advances. Though the risks to human health are many, the means to take action are available to all. By building climate-resilient health systems, countries across the South-East Asia Region can stay on track to achieve the SDG goal of health and well-being for all, and also safeguard their many public health gains. Adapting to change can be difficult; the need to do so is clear. Climate resilience is a principle all health systems must embrace. ��",dengue

The truth is that there still remains a strong possibility of yet another outbreak of dengue looming round the corner with the next inter-monsoon and North East monsoon scheduled to commence in October and December respectively. Therefore, the public has a tremendous role to play in ensuring that preventive measures- carried out during the recent outbreak of dengue- are continued with more effective into the future as well. ��It wasn�t long ago that many hospitals witnessed a difficult situation when they tried to accommodate the increasing number of dengue patients in hospital wards, that were already crowded beyond capacity. As the situation worsened with the increasing number of dengue patients admitted for treatment, many hospitals were compelled to make arrangements for temporary wards that could accommodate more patients. According to statistics at the Epidemiology Unit, a staggering 40, 625 dengue cases were recorded for the month of July alone, which is also the highest record for this year. It should also be noted that 144, 052 dengue cases have been reported since January this year. ��However, health officials who spoke to The Daily Mirror commented that they have observed an improvement in this trend since the number of dengue patients being admitted to hospitals have reduced significantly. The number of patients has dropped to 16, 481 in the month of August. ���""There are two types of mosquitoes that transmit the dengue virus, namely Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus""�Preventive measures need to be carried out rigorously��Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Assistant Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Dr. Haritha Aluthge noted that the dengue epidemic is currently subsiding countrywide. He said that as far as the hospital set up is concerned, most of the wards, which were temporarily set up, are now being closed. Therefore, he said that the dengue situation is comparatively getting less challenging than earlier. However, he warned that the latest outcome, with regard to dengue, shouldn�t be taken for granted. He explained that this is mainly because the next peak season regarding dengue would commence in December with the onset of the monsoon rains. Therefore, he said that the cleaning up operations need to be continued with as usual and done�more rigorously. ���The Ministry of Health needs to be alerted, so that it can continue with the cleaning up operations and the preventive measures against dengue. What really happens is that the authorities take preventive measures against curbing dengue only when the epidemic is increasing. It�s important to continue with these measures routinely until dengue starts peaking in December /January. If not so, we will experience a similar situation where an increased number of dengue cases will be reported again. ��Currently, the cases being reported are clearly reducing, especially in Colombo and Gampaha where a high number of dengue cases were reported. Even the wards at the National Hospital were closed down following the decrease in the number of patients. This also includes the Infectious Diseases Hospital and other peripheral stations where the temporary wards have been closed down. However, it�s crucial to carry on with the preventive measure without failure in order to keep the epidemic at bay,� Dr. Aluthge added. ��		Activities such as garbage segregation and proper disposal and the cleaning of the surrounding environment shouldn�t be stopped simply because the case load is decreasing			The most prevalent mosquito type during the last few months was the Aedes aegypti			Currently, the cases being reported are clearly reducing, especially in Colombo and Gampaha	�""We have identified high risk Grama Niladhari (GN) locations within the MoH areas""�Fourteen high-risk districts identified�to dateAccording to the Consultant Community Physician attached to the National Dengue Control Unit Dr. Prachila Samaraweera, currently there is a significant reduction in the number of patients being reported on, with cases dropping to sixty percent. �We have still identified fourteen high risk districts which include, Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Ratnapura, Kegalle, Kandy, Matale, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Vavuniya and Kalmunai. With the onset of the North East monsoon, the Northern and East Provinces will be faced with the high risk of spreading dengue. We have declared the second, National Mosquito Prevention Week from September 20 � 26 covering all MoH areas of the country. We have identified high risk Grama Niladhari (GN) locations within the MoH areas. We are planning to cover all premises that fall within the purview of these GN Divisions. Routine inspection, identification and removal of dengue mosquito breeding grounds, pest control, health education and taking legal action against those who don�t maintain their surrounding environments clean will be the focus during this programme,��Dr. Samaraweera said. ��Accordingly, she said that the Presidential Task Force, including all the ministries that fall under its purview, Public Health Inspectors, the Tri Forces, the Police, local authorities, the Ministry of Health and the public, together will have to cooperate and work together in order to make the National Mosquito Prevention Week a success. While acknowledging that the number of patients in hospitals is reducing, she also noted that the current weather pattern and the garbage collection procedures practiced at present have contributed to this, to a certain extent. �We should bear in mind that there could be an outbreak anytime. Therefore, we can�t stop the activities we have commenced. Activities such as garbage segregation and proper disposal and the cleaning of the surrounding environment shouldn�t be stopped simply because the case load is decreasing,� Dr. Samaraweera said. She said that in the recent past, the public and the media had extended support to help control the outbreak. She emphasized on the need to keep up with the good work in future as well. ���""We have declared the second, National Mosquito Prevention Week from September 20 � 26 covering all MoH areas of the country""Source reduction; the ultimate goal of removing mosquito breeding sitesWhen inquired about the current situation of the hospital, which was full of dengue patients, Consultant Physician of the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama said that the number of cases has reduced significantly. He stated that this is the result of the combination of efforts put together by the Ministry of Health with the involvement of all media groups, Government and Non-Government organizations and the general public. However, Dr. Wijewickrama said that people shouldn�t be complacent regarding this situation because after the October monsoon, a rise in the number of dengue cases is expected. �Unless we carry on these preventive programmes and continuously stress on the need to do so, a situation similar to what happened in June and July could repeat in December. If we continue to focus on source reduction, especially on the removal of mosquito breeding sites, we can reduce the risk of dengue spreading to a great extent. There are two types of mosquitoes that transmit the dengue virus, namely Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. ��Since mosquito breeding sites increased alarmingly this time, the number of mosquito larvae found in many places also increased rapidly. This situation was mostly witnessed inside houses. The most prevalent mosquito type during the last few months was the Aedes aegypti which is a household mosquito that breeds around or inside residences. That is why we receive many cases where patients are from the same family. Therefore, it is a public responsibility to keep their houses devoid of mosquito breeding sites. Keeping the surrounding environment clean should also be done as a regular habit rather than doing it as a preventive measure when there is an outbreak,� Dr. Wijewickrama concluded. � ���""According to statistics at the Epidemiology Unit, a staggering 40, 625 dengue cases were recorded for the month of July alone, which is also the highest record for this year""",dengue

Many went back spiritually healed and others leaving behind their worries at her feet. ��It was amazing and true when it happened at the annual festival of St. Anne where she appeared symbolically at Thalawila with thousands of devotees flocking to see and hear their gentle shepherd, Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis and Rt. Rev. Noel Emmanual, Lord Bishop of Trincomalee and a visiting Bishop from Jordan, Rt. Rev. Lord Bishop Maroon Lahm who led the Holy Mass.

�Free� Health Insurance for school-goers?  Channelling public funds for private profit...,"2017-08-29 00:00:11							3						 				2780","On August 22, 2017, the Cabinet approved a proposal submitted by the Minister of Education to introduce an insurance scheme for all school-goers between the ages of 5 and 19 years. The proposed insurance scheme, from last November�s budget proposals, is expected to cover 4.5 million students from all schools, including government, private (non-aided and aided), pirivena, and international schools, at an annual cost of Rs.2,700 million to the government. �The insurance scheme would be implemented through the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC), subject to an annual premium of Rs. 2,348 million. Benefits will include a maximum of Rs. 100,000 for hospitalization; a maximum of Rs.10,000 for outpatient care, Rs.100,000 for the �sudden death of a pupil,� Rs.75,000 for the �sudden death of a parent,� Rs.100,000 for �total disability� and Rs.50,000 to 100,000 for �partial disability� (Official Government News Portal of Sri Lanka 2017). In addition, and according to a recent national newspaper report, children with critical illnesses would have coverage extended to Rs.100 million for a range of diseases and procedures. ��This means that the govt would pay premiums to SLIC to cover a population that is less likely to make claims on insurance. The health insurance industry is notorious for �cherry picking� users for coverage, as reflected in the proposed insurance planThe insurance scheme, which promises to eat up a substantial proportion of the education budget, is being embarked upon with little or no public consultation, and raises questions at multiple levels. �Do we need a health insurance plan for schoolchildren? �Most striking is that this insurance plan is aimed at the most healthy population across the life cycle. Apart from the minority of school-goers who may suffer from chronic and/or critical conditions, the rest will need little inpatient and outpatient care.This means that the government would pay premiums to SLIC to cover a population that is less likely to make claims on insurance. The health insurance industry is notorious for �cherry picking� users for coverage, as reflected in the proposed�insurance plan. �Are there better ways to promote health among schoolchildren? �Rather than wasting colossal amounts on an insurance scheme, the government could invest these funds in the School Health Programme (SHP) implemented by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Ministry of Education. The programme addresses primary prevention and seeks to promote health among school-goers. Most children, apart from a section of (privileged) children in international schools, are �covered� by the programme. Among its objectives are: promoting a healthy and safe school environment to facilitate learning; protecting children from communicable and non-communicable diseases; screening children for early detection and correction of health problems; improving the nutritional status of schoolchildren; and enhancing community participation in the promotion of school health activities (Ministry of Health 2016). ��There is already an effective system in place to implement the programme, albeit under resource constraints. As a whole, the preventive sector receives a paltry allocation from the budget. According to data from the Institute for Health Policy (2015), the share of total health expenditure spent on the preventive health sector, which encompasses the School Health Programme, declined from 10% to 5% between 1990 and 2014. Although the allocation for the proposed insurance scheme is to be drawn from the education budget, it will channel scarce funds from the public sector to private healthcare companies. �Rather than wasting colossal amounts on an insurance scheme, the govt could invest these funds in the School Health Programme (SHP) implemented by Health Ministry in collaboration with the Ministry of EducationDo we agree with principles of health insurance? �Health insurance has its basis in separating the purchasing and providing functions of a health system (or the �purchaser-provider split�). Drawing on neo-classical economics, this separation is thought to make health systems more cost-efficient as healthcare providers compete for service provision, keeping quality high and costs low. However, information asymmetries and �market failures� result in just the opposite - high cost services of questionable quality. �The �purchaser-provider split� converts healthcare into a commodity that could be bought and sold in the market. In this instance, the user (school-goer) will access a private provider whose services would be paid for by the government through the SLIC. The entrance of an insurance company to administer government-funds means that users will be made vulnerable to the vagaries of the health insurance market. �Health insurance schemes almost always involve some level of spending on the part of users in the form of premiums (regular payments to be paid for an insurance contract), co-payments (a fixed amount to be paid for a covered service) or deductibles (part of the claim that is to be paid by the user). These payments are thought to prevent users from �abusing� the service. ��Sri Lanka�s publicly-financed and-delivered �free� health system is the antithesis of the health insurance model. The government is both the �purchaser� and the �provider� and there are no user-charges at points of delivery. One may argue that the public health system is far from �free.� Indeed, users do pay out-of-pocket for private services owing to deficits in the public system, a direct consequence of the government�s failure to invest in the system. ��The proposed health insurance scheme may cover some of the deficit services in the private sector. However, unlike our �free� health system, health insurance schemes dictate which services will be covered, to what extent, and for which populations.�The entrance of a private insurance company to administer government-financed insurance means that users will be made vulnerable to the vagaries of the health insurance market��As an example, if a child enters a public facility with dengue haemorrhagic fever and then requires intensive care, the parents may need to pay, at most, for tests in the private sector. However, under the health insurance model, when a child enters a private facility, the company will reimburse claims for specified benefits, which may not cover all aspects of care. ��Private health insurance companies are well-known for finding loopholes to reject claims from users. Moreover, as we see in the proposed insurance scheme, there are caps on claims. Further, we are not informed about the co-payments and deductibles that may apply. Even if the scheme extends the limit for critical illnesses, it may cover only specified conditions. �Do the experiences of poor countries support introducing private health insurance? �Health insurance has had some success in resource-poor settings where the purchasing function has remained in the hands of government (e.g. Thailand). However, outsourcing administration of the purchasing function to the health insurance industry, as the Sri Lankan government intends to do, will result in rising healthcare costs for the government. �The Maldivian government introduced a health insurance scheme in 2008 to about a quarter of its population and followed this up in 2012 with a comprehensive government-financed health insurance scheme extended to the entire population in the form of a �public-private partnership.� Per capita expenditure on health increased from an already high US$ 710 in 2012 to US$ 1996 in 2014 as compared with US$ 369 in Sri Lanka in 2014 (WHO 2013; WHO 2016). The World Bank, which supported health insurance expansion in the Maldives, now designates the Maldivian government�s healthcare financing strategy as fiscally unsustainable (World Bank 2014). ��Where governments have established multiple pooled-funds to cover different populations, for example, India, Nigeria, and numerous Latin American countries, inequitable access has been a major concern. State-subsidized insurances packages for economically disadvantaged users often lack comprehensiveness, leaving swathes of the population uncovered for some conditions. On the other hand, wealthier formal sector workers receive superior health insurance benefits while contributing substantially to their plans.The proposed insurance scheme for school-goers in Sri Lanka may look good on paper, but the government would not be as willing to cover premiums for other populations, which will certainly cost more. �Why the push for health insurance? �Health insurance has been a key element of the health sector reforms backed by the World Bank since the 1980s. At present, the World Bank, World Health Organization, and the United Nations support health insurance as a financing strategy under the�Universal Health Coverage� framework. Notably, the latter � now a mantra in global health � elides the question of public or private provision, and confers on governments the limited role of ensuring�coverage.� ��In Sri Lanka, successive governments of all party hues have supported the introduction of insurance in recent times. The Mahinda Chinthanaya vision for the future anticipated all citizens to be �covered by at least one health insurance programme, sponsored by different stakeholders including private employers, government insurance schemes and commercial insurances� (Department of National Planning 2010:150-3). The National Health Development Plan 2013-2017, put together when President Sirisena was Minister of Health, contained plans to introduce government-financed health insurance by 2017. �The promotion of health insurance has little to do with advancing access, whether at global or national level. In Sri Lanka, state-supported expansion of private healthcare continues with the health sector identified as a key area for foreign investment. Under pressures of debt-servicing and a balance of payment crisis, the government is keen to please the World Bank and IMF who would like to curb public expenditure. Indeed, the shift toward insurance in domestic policy has run in parallel with two World Bank-supported health sector development projects. �Health insurance receives support from business elites who anticipate a killing if national health insurance is extended to the entire population. Evidently, SLIC embarked upon this venture as part of its �corporate social responsibility� efforts. However, we all know that CSR projects always go hand in hand with efforts to expand markets for private accumulation. As SLIC �Chairperson Hemaka Amarasuriya noted in an interview with a newspaper (August 25), the company is looking to expand this scheme, based on its success, to a nationwide health insurance scheme. �As the health insurance industry gains a foothold, healthcare costs for the government would rise, diverting more funds from the resource-starved public system. As healthcare becomes increasingly commodified, the (manufactured) demand for health services would increase, expanding markets for the multinational healthcare/insurance industryDangers ahead �Governments in Sri Lanka have thus far displayed reluctance to undertake outright privatization of the health sector as �free health� holds wide public appeal. Instead they have (rhetorically) supported the �free health� policy while adopting an insidious strategy of privatization by investing insufficiently in the public system and providing massive fiscal incentives for private healthcare expansion. Despite these efforts, the out-of-pocket spending associated with private healthcare has restricted private healthcare expansion to rural and remote areas. The introduction of health insurance would remove existing impediments by providing (limited) �financial risk protection� to those who cannot afford to pay for private healthcare. �As the private sector expands, companies will entice healthcare workers away from the public system, a trend that has already begun in Colombo. As the private health insurance industry gains a foothold, healthcare costs for the government would rise, diverting more funds from the resource-starved public system to the private healthcare/insurance industry. As healthcare becomes increasingly commodified, the (manufactured) demand for health services would increase, expanding markets for the multinational healthcare/insurance industry. �It is clear who stands to gain and lose from this health insurance scheme. Its introduction and the government�s broader privatization agenda must be resisted to protect �free health� and ensure comprehensive healthcare access for coming generations. �(The writer is attached to the Department of Community and Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jaffna) �",dengue

Colombo University on an environmental mission,"2017-08-25 00:00:06							0						 				872","On April 14 (2017), when the man-made Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed killing 31 people, the entire nation mourned. Environment experts aired their views on what to do and what not to do. Everybody blamed the politicians and as usual it became a political issue, with various parties being subject to blame. Compensation was paid and temporary solutions were found by moving residents from affected areas to a safer place. Meanwhile long term plans were discussed in Parliament to shift the garbage dump from Meethotamulla to Muthurajawela and Puttalam. Unfortunately the decision-makers hadn�t considered the impact on the environment when dumping garbage at Muthurajawela. Garbage shouldn�t be dumped at Muthurajawela for the sake of the environment. �Floods in the South�Before dust the settled in Muthurajawela another calamity took place. This time the nature played havoc by causing continuous rains for three days. The rains led to floods, mainly in the South. Apart from the 202 deaths, the damage to properties and livelihood exceeded a couple of billion rupees. The entire country rallied round to support the victims. The corporate sector, the media and religious leaders played huge roles. One notable event was highlighted in the process. The students of the Jaffna University collected school books and visited the South, distributing them among the schoolchildren whose books were taken away by the floods. We shouldn�t forget that the mental wounds which were created by the war haven�t healed. These acts of kindness and generosity will be remembered for a long time. The Sri Lanka Army in Jaffna, under the leadership of Major General Mahes Senanayake (present Army Commander), played a huge role in organizing the travel of the undergrads from Jaffna to the South. ��Dengue epidemic�Generally health issues crop up after a flood. This time the dengue has so far killed 350 people. More than 100,000 people have suffered from dengue. Unless quick action is taken, the number of deaths will rise. The dengue mosquitoes are flying all over the island and now this disease has become a national issue and is considered an epidemic. Given this situation the academic staff of the Department of Zoology and Environment Sciences of the University of Colombo, headed by Prof. Wipula Yapa and Prof. Mayuri Wijesinghewith, the blessings of the Vice Chancellor Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake and the Dean of the Science Faculty Prof. K. R. R. Mahanama, initiated a shramadanaya (A campaign where participants provide their services free) at the university premises on the 27th July 2017. Those who participated not only cleaned the premises, but also took an initiative to counter dengue with the use of medicinal plants. They were able to create an awareness on how the improper disposal of polythene and plastic can aid the spread of dengue. The entire Faculty of Science, the University of Colombo and School of Computing (UCSC) supported the shramadanaya. ��Shramadanaya and BEEZ�Prof. Mayuri Wijesinghe, who organised the shramadanaya, received the support of all the students. Charuni Pathmeswaran was the link between the academic staff and the students. The Vice Chancellor provided a huge boost by deciding to close the Science Faculty at 1.00 pm so that students could take part in the shramadanaya. It�s rarely that the Science Faculty halts lectures unless it�s absolutely necessary. The newly elected student body of Base for Enthusiasts of Environment Sciences and Zoology (BEEZ) under the leadership of Amayaa Wijesinghe (President) sprung into action. They had obtained the medicinal plants for a symbolic tree planting session and also organised a specially designed picture postcard to carry the message �Say No to Polythene�. One star class hotel was kind enough to provide refreshments for all (300) participants. Kavinda De Zoysa, an Alumnus of the University of Colombo, donated plants while Sampath Bank sponsored the event. ��Say no to polytheneProf. Yapa who is the brainchild of the initiative �Say No to Polythene� is heading the awareness campaign. Through this initiative he hopes to reduce the use of polythene and plastic. He has had several discussions with like-minded people to find answers to how a reduction can be made in the use of polythene and plastic. He is of the opinion that all super markets should charge a reasonable price from the customers for �Silisili Bags� (Polythene bags) to discourage the use of polythene. For supermarkets to implement this the Government must intervene. Otherwise it won�t happen due to various reasons. At this very moment Prof. Yapa is conducting a research on how to produce a somewhat stronger paper bag at a low cost to replace polythene bags. He is also earmarking bank branch networks to promote the concept �Say No to Polythene� among customers. ��Medicinal Plants to Counter DengueThe initiative taken to counter Dengue by using �Nature�s Friend�-the plants- is the brainchild of Prof. Deepthi Wickremasinghe. Wickremesinghe had discussions with Prof. Yapa to make a joint effort with the view of countering Dengue. Prof. Wickremasinghe has collected several scientific data and statistics from programmes initiated by the leading organizations in other parts of the world on mosquitoes and Dengue. Her findings have made others become aware of the importance of the local plants such as Daspethiya (Marigolds), Pangiri (Citronella), Sera (Lemon Grass), Heen Maduruthala (Holy Basil), Kuppamania (Catnip) etc. During the discussions she made it a point that these plants not only have the potential to repel mosquitoes, but also can contribute to the �Green Cover� (even in the small way) and add value to the landscape (specially the use of Daspethiya). ��Green University�The Vice Chancellor during his address to the students thanked Prof. Yapa, the academic staff and BEEZ for initiating such an important event (Say No to Polythene and Counter Dengue) and requested students to get more involved in University activities mainly for the benefit of the environment. He reminded the students how he spent forty years with the University of Colombo-first as a student, afterwards as a lecturer and now as the Vice Chancellor. He said that his goal is to turn the University of Colombo in to a �Green University� by the year 2020. He has already started working towards realizing that goal. He requested students to protect the nature and the environment and help make the country a better place for future generations to live in. Prof. Mahanama, the Dean of the Science Faculty, in his address elaborated on the future plans of the university for the benefit of students. He requested them to obtain the maximum benefits from the facilities provided and work towards the betterment of the society. He also said that plans were being made to build three buildings to provide students with more facilities. He assured that none of the buildings will have a harmful effect on the environment.���Prof. Yapa in his speech thanked the Vice Chancellor and the Dean for playing an active part in the shramadanaya. He also thanked the academic staff and the students of the Science Faculty for extending their fullest cooperation to make the event a success. He highlighted the activities of the BEEZ, which is turning itself in to a beehive of activity. �He also said that there are several environmental programmes in the pipeline and that they will be commenced within the next few months. He paid a tribute to AdeZ Sri Lanka (Link Children to the Nature) for joining hands with this shramadanaya campaign and requested them to continue the good work in the future too. ��Mission of the ProfessorsIt�s amazing to see how three university professors (Prof. Yapa, Prof. Mayuri and Prof. Deepthi) have taken initiatives to counter Dengue at low cost. Any person in Sri Lanka can implement these programmes in any part of the country. Sadly these professors aren�t prestigious award winners hence they won�t grab �media attention. This writer humbly request the media (TV and Print) to interview them so that more information can be obtained from the learned professors for the benefit of the general public. Prof. Wijesinghe set up the momentum for the entire university by bringing together all the students and other members of the faculty body towards a worthy cause. Prof. Wickremesinghe has already started her campaign with the students using medicinal plants. They hope to plant trees in 50 schools in the Colombo District. Prof. Yapa launched his campaign �Say No to Polythene� with a specially designed picture postcard. The first card was presented to the Vice Chancellor just before the shramadanaya. Whoever who buys a card will pledge to reduce the consumption of polythene. All proceeds from the sale of cards will go to implement the green programmes, organised by the BEEZ. ��The University of Colombo is one of the best or perhaps the best university in the country. The students are given the freedom to implement programmes under the guidance of a lecturer without compromising on their studies. Despite loads to study, the undergrads of the University of Colombo are committed to complete their mission. However, for this they need the support from all quarters. Any long journey has to start with the first step. �Say No to Polythene� started in �July this year. As President Kennedy once said, �It may take one day, one year or one hundred years to complete, but the main thing is to start�. Forty years ago, when we were youth, practically every youth smoked cigarettes for fun, but it is not so now. They are aware of the repercussions. There is also a political will to stop smoking and the authorities have specified the penalty if a citizen is caught smoking in public. Polythene consumption can be reduced by educating the general public, but Government support is a must. ��Save the nature and environment�If we don�t act now and save the environment, we will be forced to learn lessons on damaging the environment by paying a heavy price. Global warming has come to stay. No one needs to mention that it�s an unwelcome guest. We aren�t that blind not to observe the repercussions of �climate change and global warming. Danger signals are already present and as adults we have a moral duty to work towards saving the environment. If we fail in our attempts the future generation will curse us for not protecting the nature and the environment. The time has come to give back what we owe Mother Lanka. All the polythene and plastic that we have used so far and what we are going to use in the future will remain for centuries (except for biodegradable ones) though our average lifespan is between 70-75 years.

Also, the public opinion is as such that he is guilty for these allegations because he is evading investigations,� it said.It said the minister had created chaos in Sri Lanka�s medical education by sacrificing it to the business community, by being biased towards the SAITM, misusing public funds to takeover the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital and voluntarily ignoring to gazette minimum standards of the medical education which were set by the Sri Lanka Medical Council.The JO said the Minister had failed to adequately respond to the Dengue epidemic and created a financial loss to the state by influencing to purchase a rejected medicinal drug for breast cancer.

Administrative expenses increased 30.56 percent YoY to Rs.3.32 billion, which Pathirage mainly attributed to the opening of the new city hotel Movenpick under the group�s leisure arm.Due to the group�s increased borrowings and the high interest rates in the economy, finance expenses rose to 39.64 percent to Rs.1.26 billion, while net finance costs increased 27.69 percent YoY to Rs.947.93 million.Insurance contract liabilities changed to Rs.237.22 million from Rs.30.78 million YoY, due to funds being transferred from the �Life Insurance Fund� to the �Shareholder�s Fund� of Softlogic Life Insurance PLC, which contracted Softlogic�s profit margin during 1Q18.The group�s tax expenses during the quarter also rose 132 percent YoY to Rs.230 million.The group�s asset base at the end of 1Q18 stood at Rs.102.71 billion, up from Rs. 101.63 billion at the start of the financial year.The three months saw Softlogic�s long-term interest bearing borrowings falling to Rs.27.94 billion from Rs.29.66 billion, while the short-term borrowings increased to Rs.7.14 billion from Rs.6.33 billion.The tight monetary policy conditions saw long-term public deposits at the group�s financial arm increasing to Rs.4.04 billion from Rs.1.99 billion within the three months, while short-term public deposits fell by a similar amount.The financial services profits after tax (PAT) for 1Q18 fell 1.41 percent YoY to Rs.276.66 million, while revenue increased 18.9 percent YoY to Rs. 2.53 billion.Similar to all other healthcare service providers that enjoyed high profits during the quarter due to the dengue epidemic, Softlogic�s Asiri Hospitals chain too contributed strongly to the group with Rs.427.12 million in PAT, up 44.29 percent YoY.Despite the high interest regime, retail operations posted a Rs.222.80 million PAT, up 138.38 percent YoY. The country�s main festive season in April may have contributed to higher spending on Softlogic brands.The opening of the new hotel, which has yet to hit its full stride, nearly quadrupled leisure and property segmental losses after tax YoY to Rs.227.46 million. The segment�s revenue increased 126.06 percent YoY to Rs. 450.09 million.�What requires improvement is the leisure sector�s macroeconomic fundamentals, but occupancy rates are moving in the right direction at our hotels which will ensure those start-up costs are recovered much faster than projected,� Pathirage said.The information technology segment�s PAT fell 16.77 percent YoY to Rs. 106.19 million, while revenue fell 11.70 percent YoY to Rs. 4.17 billion.Pathirage said that the disruption of the Nokia business contributed to lower sales, although new Nokia handsets running on the Android operating system have now been launched.

"Dengue: All talk, no show","2017-08-16 00:03:23							0						 				2277","What happened to the huge outcry that prevailed in the country a few weeks ago against the killer disease, dengue? The entire government was agog with finding solutions to the rapid spread of the disease days ago while media too had focused its full attention towards the same end. There seems to be a considerable let up now in the flurry of activities that had been aimed at the eradication of dengue mosquitoes apparently because of the slight reduction of the number of dengue cases and more attractive political issues such as the Ravi Karunanayake saga coming to the fore. ��Despite the Colombo National Hospital having closed last week the special dengue ward it had opened last month claiming that there was a decline in the number of dengue patients admitted to the hospital, the reports from the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry do not paint a rosy picture on the situation. The number of cases reported in the last two months (June and July), according to the Epidemiology Unit had been 25,222 and 37,837 respectively and this points to a fifty percent increase of the killer disease last month compared to the previous month. ��However, there is a progress in the situation this month with the number of cases reported hither to standing at around 5,000, and at this rate the number to be reported at the end of the month would be around 15,000. One can argue that this is a drastic reduction in the spread of the disease compared to last month but one should not be blind to the fact that this month�s number is equal to one fourth of the total number of cases reported last year and to half the number reported in 2015. Therefore it is too early for the country to take solace or rejoice over any success in the prevention of the disease or in the eradication of mosquitoes. ��The country, including the government has a habit of being carried away by the media hypes and media, in turn have a habit of forgetting any important matter once it gets a new topic. And thus the eradication of mosquitoes seems to have taken a back seat now. No shramadana campaigns for cleaning the premises of various institutions were heard of, no fumigation in any area was seen for the past few weeks, with the hullabaloo over the garbage disposal receding and new topics taking over. ��We witnessed the same situation in respect of floods as well. When the Kelani Ganga devastated the lower Kelani Valley areas in May last year, we witnessed many pundits waxing eloquent on the reasons of flooding and how to minimize or prevent floods for good and also on helping victims. So many high level meetings were held where politicians put forward so many plans to prevent recurrence and rehabilitate the affected areas and the people. However, it is public knowledge that nothing happened until the next flood threat was announced by the Disaster Management Centre in May this year. ��The relative decline in dengue cases reported this month might be attributed to the absence of rain in the densely populated Western Province. With the next round of inclement weather, we might face a similar or worse situation, if the authorities let up on the preventive and eradication measures against the killer epidemic. � ��",dengue
Invest in the future and donate to Project Little Hearts,"2017-08-12 00:03:41							0						 				1279","ealth is a primary need in any society. Sri Lankans are fortunate to enjoy a free health system in the country. People who have really benefited from the system will vouch for it. Unfortunately most of them don�t think that they need to speak about it because they are already served with this facility. In other words they have taken this service for granted. The best example is the children who were treated for heart disease and critical illnesses at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH). Since 2005, over 10,000 children have undergone catheter based interventions or diagnostic procedures at LRH. Since 2007, over 7000 children have undergone cardiac surgeries. All these procedures were done totally free, but the actual cost could have varied from Rs. 30,000 to over one million a procedure. This is the full side of the half-filled glass of water. Unfortunately there is an empty side which is almost equal to the full side. An equal number of children with heart diseases or critical illnesses are added to the waiting lists as the hospital doesn�t have adequate facilities to treat all children in need. They occasionally make their voices heard when they ask for financial assistance to seek treatment in the private sector or overseas. Most of them continue having their names in waiting lists and even without their knowledge eventually lose their beloved child. Certain losses can be accepted, but the preventable loss of a child can�t be accepted under any circumstance. Who will say no to it, if it can be prevented by improving infrastructure facilities? ���Improving infrastructure facilities ��Project Little Hearts was initiated with only the sole objective of minimising the number of preventable childhood deaths in Sri Lanka. Approximately 375,000 children are born annually in Sri Lanka and around 3000 of them leave this world even before reaching their first birthday. Out of this, about 1500 deaths can be prevented every year through improvement of infrastructure facilities to treat heart diseases and critical illness in children. Considering the geographical, infrastructure and population characteristics of Sri Lanka, the best and most cost effective intervention is to expand the facilities to treat such children at the LRH, the premier public children�s hospital which provides free treatment to children from all districts of Sri Lanka. The first step in addressing the issue is development infrastructure facilities. Little Hearts is a project initiated to construct and commission a ten (10) storey Cardiac and Critical Care Complex to provide necessary infrastructure facilities for such children. ��The proposal for this building came up in 2013, with the expansion of the cardiac complex at LRH. It was initially planned as a four storied building to accommodate the need to perform 2000 surgeries and 1000 catheter based interventions to treat all children with heart diseases in Sri Lanka. However, considering the limited space available and other requirements of the hospital, the building was later expanded to a ten storeyed complex with addition of Medical Intensive care unit, Neonatal Intensive care unit and training facilities required in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Planning is done by the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB). The Ministry of Health and Department of National planning has provided necessary approvals. Land has been allocated according to the master plan of the hospital. What is left now is the raising of funds and the construction. ����Our target is to raise Rs. two billion that�s required for construction and commissioning of this Cardiac and Critical Care Complex at LRH. If we have charged Rs. 120,000 from all 17,000 patients who have undergone treatment for their cardiac condition at LRH, we could have easily built this complex. But as treatment was given totally free, today we have to seek public support to expand the facility. Two billion is a colossal amount of money to raise this facility, but if we all get together and donate whatever we can, we can raise even double that amount in no time. We need only willingness to donate and to do it without a delay. Everyday that we delay the project, we lose about 4-5 children. Imagine the public�s interest in saving 5 children getting drowned or being caught up in a fire. In such a situation, everybody will do his/her part without a delay. That is because they see the need themselves. These children die at different places due to different reasons. Only we know that they have died due to heart disease. Therefore, you need to believe in us. Don�t wait until it happens to your own child or your grandchild as it may be too late. ��Mr & Mrs Pathirana with their baby operated at LRHThose who found true happiness�On the day, when Mrs. Rubasinghe, a retired Clerk, first saw the television program in Derana TV, she realised this need. Her child, who is now a medical student, was treated at LRH in 1992. She called more than 60 people in her list of contacts and requested from them to donate. The following day she arrived at LRH and made a personal donation of Rs. 25,000 to the project as a person who had reaped the benefits of free health care. She wanted the system to improve and save more children. ��Mr. Thabrew�s granddaughter was about to celebrate her first birthday. He thought that the best gift that he could give to her granddaughter was to save another child in her name. He donated Rs. 10,000 and received a certificate under her granddaughter�s name in recognition of his efforts to save a child. ��Tehan Dhanushka is a first year student in management faculty at Wayamba University. He has saved Rs. 10,000, from the money he raised by giving tuition to school children, with the view of doing something for the benefit of children. The moment he came to know about the project, he came to LRH and donated it to save another needy child. ����""All top corporates are spending millions on CSR projects. The best CSR project one can carry out is one that will save the life of a child. People who will benefit from this project are the average people working in those corporates""�Mr. and Mrs. Pathirana had their first baby and on the first day itself came to know that the baby had a heart problem. They were helpless as it was a complex condition and the baby was just a newborn weighing even less than 3kg. She was operated at LRH and discharged from hospital. When they came to know about the project, they immediately visited the hospital and donated Rs. 300,000, not because they had enough spare money, but because they came to realise the need to improve such facilities in the government sector. ��At the till donation campaign called �Till Parade�, children arrived from morning till late evening and donated their Tills to save another child. Within a day it was possible to collect over Rs. 1.4million through till donations alone. Some children had collected money to buy toy cars, �dolls or compute games. But they decided to donate all what they had to save another child. They have realised that saving a life is more precious than a car or a doll or a computer game. The happiness that they have experienced by making the donations will last for many decades in their hearts unlike the mental satisfaction they get from a car or a doll.Prisoners at Welikada Prison are a category in our society without any income. After realising the importance of helping the project they have worked out a way to offer support. The only thing that they can donate is their food which they get from the government. They have decided to donate the cost of their meals for a single day to the Little Hearts Project. This clearly proves that if there is a will, there is a way. ��The way forward..We need only one million people in Sri Lanka to donate Rs. 100 per month for 2years to raise this amount. We have facilitated that through Dialog and Hutch mobile companies. Any user can send a text message typed REG<Space>LH to 77100 and register for donation. Individually, what can you do with Rs. 100, but if we all work together we can save 1500 critically ill children. Can you imagine the power of masses? Why not be one of them?�Mrs. Rubasinghe, Mr. Thabrew and Tehan don�t belong to the highest income group in Sri Lanka. But they have a heart to give. Having money and giving money are two different things. People who give are the ones who know the happiness and benefits of giving and therefore will continue to give. Once this facility is constructed, we can treat 10,000 children who have heart disease and critical illnesses, annually. In 20 years we can save 200,000 lives. So to initiate the process we need only Rs. 10,000 per life. We need 200,000 people like Tehan, Mr. Thabrew, Mr and Mrs. Pathirana and Mrs. Rubasinghe, who will give something back to the society. If you are one of them, you can visit any BOC branch or visit our website and donate Rs. 10,000 to save a life. You need only a heart to donate. If you have a heart, you will have enough money to donate. ��All top corporates are spending millions on CSR projects. The best CSR project one can carry out is one that will save the life of a child. People who will benefit from this project are the average people working in those corporates. So what you donate is actually donated to look after �your own staff�. It may not be the average worker and his child. We have seen enough and more instances where critically ill children from the most affluent families die due to lack of facilities in that country. When your child is critically ill even if you can hire an air ambulance, you might not be in a situation to move him out. However much money you have, you can�t get a cardiac transplant in a developed country if you aren�t a citizen in that country. This highlights the need to improve such facilities in our own country, not only to help the poorest of the poor, but to serve all strata of the society if a need arises. We need only 200 companies to donate 10million each. Is your company within that top 200? ��Ways to contributeWe have facilitated almost all the possible ways to donate for the project. Those who are willing to donate Rs. 100 per month can donate using their Dialog or Hutch mobile. Just type REG<space>LH and send a SMS to 77100. Mobitel users can use M Cash to donate. �Those who wish to donate online using their credit cards or Sampath Vishwa portal, can do so using our secure website www.littlehearts.lk/donations. �If you wish to donate cash, you can either deposit it in our account no 79738633 at BOC by visiting one of the branches of Bank of Ceylon. You can also make donations at any Keels Super outlet islandwide. ��We request children to donate their tills at any BOC branch nearest to them. They will be happy to accept your till. ��If you work in a corporate, you can organise the donation of a day�s salary or the funds set aside for CSR projects. You may also consider donating a fraction of you profit from each item sold by your company. If your corporate or organisation has a big heart and is ready to donate 200 million, we can name one floor after your company. ��Tehan Dhanushka, a student in Wayamba University, donating moneyIf you need any further information or request letters please call us at 0766411730 or email us info@littlehearts.lk. ��We have seen parents selling their houses, tractors or whatever they have to seek treatment for their children. As a society, if we can get together, we can prevent it happening to our own brothers and sisters. This isn�t only a donation to save another child. It may be your own child or your grandchild who gets treated following a heart disease, dengue or pneumonia in this unit. It will serve the whole country as almost all children with heart diseases and critical illnesses are transferred to LRH. By helping to construct this unit you assure a safe childhood to your loved ones. Do you want to wait for others to do it and risk the life of your beloved child? Imagine that your child gets a critical illness and is brought to LRH. How will you feel if we have to say sorry because we can�t provide intensive care treatment as all ICU beds are occupied? Imagine your situation when you have to witness your beloved child leave this world due to lack of critical care facilities. It has happened in the past and happening at present, but don�t let that happen at least in the future. Donate today to prevent it happening in the future. ��",dengue

July tourist arrivals down 1.8%,"2017-08-08 10:04:22							0						 				1355","Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka this July fell 1.8 percent to 205,482 tourists compared to July 2016, as the Chinese tourist boom, which pushed up the market growth during the last off-season, petered out, bringing to question whether even the revised 2.2 million tourist arrival projection for this year will�be met.Sri Lanka�s largest regional market in Western Europe expanded 3.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) to 80,896 tourists, despite the two traditionally largest markets, the UK and Germany, both fell 1.6 percent and 1.2 percent YoY, attracting 23,553 and 10,835 tourists, respectively.French arrivals grew 4 percent YoY to 11,390 visitors, while Dutch arrivals grew 22.9 percent YoY to 11,990 tourists.East Asian arrivals fell 3.8 percent YoY to 41,264 tourists, weighed down by Chinese arrivals that fell 7.1 percent YoY to 28,445 tourists. The Japanese market grew 10.8 percent YoY to 4,025 tourists.Arrivals from South Asia meanwhile fell 4.2 percent YoY to 40,769 tourists, due to a fall in arrivals from the Maldives, Bangladesh and other neighbours, in spite of arrivals from India increasing 4.8 percent YoY to 29,006 tourists. The Middle East market contracted 13.1 percent YoY to 16,163 tourists, while arrivals from North America increased 6.1 percent YoY to 10,875 tourists and arrivals from Australasia fell 2.4 percent YoY to 7,958 tourists. Inbound visitors from Eastern Europe fell 18 percent YoY to 6,127 tourists.For the first seven months of 2017, arrivals to the island grew by 3.6 percent YoY to 1.22 million tourists. For the remaining five months, arrivals would have to grow by nearly 12 percent YoY to reach the 2.2 million arrivals target of the government. The state had until a fortnight ago held on to a 2.5 million tourist arrivals projection for the year, despite the lack of any large-scale tourism promotional efforts. Many stakeholders are now blaming the widespread prevalence of dengue as the cause for the decline, despite the government until this June insisting that dengue played no role in visitor levels this year. For the first seven months, arrivals from Western Europe increased 8 percent YoY to 411,230 tourists, while South Asian arrivals fell 3.8 percent YoY to 272,853 tourists and East Asian arrivals fell 4.6 percent YoY to 261,561 tourists.��Dengue: No cause for alarm, ministry tells tourists�Since the dengue epidemic has been successfully brought under control, the tourists visiting Sri Lanka need not be alarmed or distressed over the situation, a Tourism and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry statement said.�Though the Western Province area was affected with the disease, it is under control now with the efforts of creating dengue eradication and awareness programmes and Colombo is now being cleared of garbage and the cleaning of drainage systems is also taking place,� the statement said.�The number of dengue cases has decreased sharply by 40 percent since mid-July due to planned and systematic efforts by the respective state authorities in the recent weeks,� it added.The ministry therefore urged the travellers to resort to correct sources of information to find out the latest updates on the disease, such as the Health Ministry website and all Sri Lanka missions abroad.��Sri Lanka Tourism will continue to update the progress and is confident that there is no cause for alarm,� the statement said.��",dengue

The �today� and �tomorrow� of Sinhala,"2017-08-08 00:02:17							0						 				1195","The Cumaratunga Munidasa Sisuvarama, organised by the Cumaratunga Munidasa Foundation, was held for the sixth consecutive time on July 25 (Tuesday) at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Centre in Colombo.Poetry strikes us in roughly the same way that the movies strike the Americans. In both instances, we are so overwhelmed by the first time we heard or saw them; which American can�t think of their archetypal saviour, the cowboy, without remembering the films of John Ford (The Searchers), and which Sri Lankan can�t think of the rabbit, probably the most cartoonish animal out there, without thinking of Cumaratunga Munidasa�s �Ha Ha Hari Hawa� and the many renditions of it? �The great achievement of a movie, I think, is the great achievement of a poem; both take us back to those triumphs, defeats, broken hearts, and so much more besides that we had undergone when we first encountered them. A film is like a language, after all; it�s built, sustained, sometimes even improved on through nostalgia. But nostalgia alone isn�t enough. What is needed, now more than ever before, is a set of discerning people to transform that nostalgia into a living, breathing entity. The Sinhala language is a case in point. It nourishes us, and then appeals to us to perpetuate it. �I know, have talked with, and have conceded to those doomsday prophets (whose numbers are increasing, disturbingly) who predict the end of the Sinhala language as we know it. Underlying their prediction are certain irrefutable facts, prime among them being the virtual erasure of its spoken/written dichotomy by popular culture. �It�s one of the greatest ironies of our time, but when mass media (journalism, advertising, television) discovered our mother tongue, it wasn�t liberated. It was stunted. Rather badly. Probably that�s why it�s hard to come across young poets writing in Sinhala, not because they don�t have the ideas but because they don�t read. It�s a contemporary dilemma, since by refusing to read, they refuse to take forward what underpins all those poems which nourished�their childhoods. �For that reason, a scholarship program aimed at recognising academic achievement in Sinhala has to take note of certain realities. Firstly, not every student who achieves distinctions in that subject actually continues to �study� it. More often than not, these students are compelled to take to another subject once they reach their A Levels (with science and commerce being the preferred options). Secondly, the scholarship as such, while monetary at the outset, must aim for more than the usual incentives such schemes are built on, not least because a language can�t be limited to academia and is probably the only subject that lives and breathes on its own outside academia. �In 2012 the Cumaratunga Munidasa Foundation began one such program. That year was special; it marked the 125th birth anniversary of the Foundation�s figurehead. Together with the National Savings Bank and Ada Derana, each winner was given a monthly bursary of 1,000 rupees, a 100,000 rupee bank deposit, and a laptop. Named Sisuvarama, the program was unique for one reason. It targeted the Ordinary Level exams, knowing that not all high achievers at that stage in their education follow it up as the years pass by. The organisers of Sisuvarama were spot on there, since almost all the scholarship winners have subsequently moved into other harder subjects. �That was five years back. Five years later, more specifically two weeks ago (July 25) at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Centre in Colombo, the Foundation held its scholarship ceremony for the sixth time, in commemoration of Cumaratunga Munidasa�s 130th birth anniversary. It was an ill-chosen day: the petrol strike was on. Such a mundane issue, however, couldn�t overwhelm what I took from this Sisuvarama. ���""The problem with the contemporary world is that it separates the academic from the social. We are goaded into categorising the likes of Cumaratunga as writers, poets, forgetting that they were less the intellectuals they are cut out to be""�The stories behind this year�s winners merit mention here. Of the seven, three come from Galle, two from Panadura, one from Minuwangoda, and one from Colombo. The three winners from Galle (Sandamini Paranavithana, Thiwanka Ruvishani, and Yasamini Anuththara) all attended Sanghamitta Balika, and all three come from backgrounds which, while certainly not cosmetic or extravagant, nurtured their love to read and to write. Roshani Dhanushika (from President�s College, Minuwangoda) took an interest in the subject after she began to be taught by capable teachers from Grade Eight. Pasindu Buwaneka de Silva (from Isipathana College), had to write his paper while recovering from dengue at the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Angoda. Vimukthi Abhishek (from Nalanda College) started entering essay competitions from Grade Three, while Thisari Walawage entered her present school (Visakha Vidyalaya) from the Grade Five scholarship and studied in the English�medium thereafter. ���Of the people who spoke that day, Professor Wimal Dissanayake struck me the most. In the space of half an hour, Professor Dissanayake dwelt on an otherwise hackneyed topic: the place for modernity in tradition. Mercifully, he wasn�t concerned about bringing modernity to tradition, rather the other way around and that by delving into how the man at the centre of the event ensured that we did not forget who we were while engaging with the rest of the world. �Aluth aluth da nothanana jaathin lova nonagi,� Victor Ratnayake quoted Cumaratunga Munidasa for me as he lamented how today�s composers have forgotten the past. What�s true for our composers is true for those who will wield our mother�tongue tomorrow. �The problem with the contemporary world is that it separates the academic from the social. We are goaded into categorising the likes of Cumaratunga as writers, poets, or the more derogatory deshiya buddhimathun, forgetting that they were less the intellectuals they are cut out to be than the national revivalists they actually were. �Reading �Kumara Gee�, I cannot help but conclude that Cumaratunga Munidasa, much as he loved the language of the Sinhalese, loved it less than he loved his nation and his people,� Malinda Seneviratne wrote, and I agree. To me, and to my countrymen, his legacy can�t be rationalised by linguistics or semantics or sociology. He was more, much more, than anything those terms can ever convey. ���When Nanda Malini resurrected not just Cumaratunga but also Tibet S. Mahinda and Wimalaratne Gamage in her collection Handahami, she gave out some of the most memorable lyrics we had heard as children. I could feel a thin film of tears across my eyes as she sang �Ha Ha Hari Hawa�, that romantic tribute to the rabbit which Titus Thotawatte took as the title song of his version of Bugs Bunny. The film opened up when I realised that Titus had been an ardent follower of Cumaratunga; as a member of the Hela Havula, he was the first in our cinema who tried to do away with those Sanskrit impurities his guru had strived to erase. It opened up even more when I remembered that my childhood had been adorned by a popular culture (including Dosthara Honda Hitha) which stood for what my country spoke, in one voice. That voice went back to one person, one name. The connection was hard not to make. �That is why Sisuvarama is so important to me, to my country, to everyone interested in Sinhala. A language, by its definition, sweeps across demographics and social barriers. It survives despite them because it�s a living, breathing entity. But I am upset by how we tend to our own language less and less, particularly those of us who are entranced by modernity and the modernist discourse on nationality. ���The fact is that we don�t read our own books, our own stories. The fact is that we market our �aptitude� for our language without nourishing ourselves in our literature. By forgetting grammar and syntax, artists dabbling in Sinhala today are doing a disservice to our language. They are little more than anchorless ships, a point which crops up when considering that they are hailed by some as �revolutionaries.� Well, so were James Joyce and Jean-Luc Godard, but unlike their counterparts today, they were aware of the work done before them, which prepared them for what they did. �All this is rooted in a rotten circle that goes around and around; those who grow up in Sinhala-speaking families lose their interest in it, enchanted as they are by pop culture, while those who grow up in a more westernised environment abandon it to devote themselves to English theatre and literary circles. (This strange dichotomy, between those who neglect Sinhala despite their vernacular backgrounds and those who take to English because of their non-vernacular backgrounds, baffles me.) But by that I don�t bemoan modernity, as some do. The truth is that modernity and nationalism can and do cohere, and as scholars like Benedict Anderson have observed, the latter can be more unifying than the cosmopolitanism we teach our children today. �The Cumaratunga Munidasa Foundation has clearly taught us some lessons in that respect. Relevant for our time, relevant for all time. What they are, we know. All we need to do is take a leaf from them, and from those seven students who won this year, and try to define ourselves based on how much we understand what defines us. It won�t be easy, but my guess is that it won�t be too difficult either. �",dengue

Dismay As Sri Lanka Battles Inadequacies In Implementing Dengue Vaccine,"2017-08-04 13:08:28							2						 				4231","It has become nothing but humdrum when it comes to warning the general public in taking precautions against dengue. Something that we all know, despite every measure being taken, is that the disease can�t be eradicated overnight. This has to be said in the backdrop of the inevitable number of citizens falling victim to dengue everyday. So the situation has now aggravated and more attention is being paid to dengue cures and treatments. What has become really important is to find light at the end of the tunnel and that amounts to a medically curative method.� �The good news is that the world�s first licensed dengue vaccine, approved by the World Health Organization, is available and now in use as a treatment for dengue. The vaccine is currently been used in 18 countries. It�s also available in Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand apart from being used in other continents. The licensed dengue vaccine is a live attenuated recombinant tetravalent vaccine which is given on a 3 dose series on a 0, 6 and 12 month basis. The vaccine is recommended for people in the age range of 9 - 45 years in dengue endemic countries.�Perspective of Medical Personas �According to Professor in Medicine Arjuna De Silva, attached to the Faculty of Medicine in Ragama, the dengue vaccine seemingly is an effective method to help control dengue in the country. �The vaccine is WHO approved. The vaccine has an overall effect against all four dengue serotypes. This seems to have highly probable positive effects to help treat dengue patients and so far has been reported safe. Also 7 of the Asian countries have implemented the vaccine,� Professor De Silva said.�While a vaccine for dengue seems so essential for a country like Sri Lanka-which is now battling a dengue crisis-declaring the use of this vaccine has not been simple, hence the delay in it being used in medical� practice in the country. For the record around 300 dengue related deaths have been reported.A dengue patient receives treatment at a government hospitalWhen the reasons for the delay in the dengue vaccine were inquired from the GMOA Secretary, Dr. Haritha Aluthge, he stated that the vaccine is yet to be studied and trial tested. Aluthge said that it is only then that it can be approved for medical use in the country. He said that such trials and tests are essentianl as a possible risk entails the implementation of a new vaccine. �Before the vaccine can be used on patients, a trial test has to be done to ensure safety. We should also refer to the trial tests done in other countries. The vaccine has to be studied and trial tested before it can be used medically. There is a procedure to follow with regard to the National Medical Regulatory Authority (NMRA) of the country before approving a vaccine. The vaccines should be affirmed in terms of cost effectiveness as well. We should also consider the success rate of the vaccine in other countries. Generally the procedure to introduce a new vaccine to a country is something that takes time. We can�t use Sri Lankan patients as guinea pigs,� he warned.Reports reveal that Sri Lankans have flown to Singapore on various occasions to get the vaccine. While opulent citizens may be able to get vaccinated, the less affluent have been left without such an opportunity in obtaining the vaccination. These happenings have led to the questioning about the delay in the use of the vaccine in Sri Lanka given that it�s already being used in a country like Singapore.But according to Dr. Aluthge, the results of the vaccine can change from country to country. That is why trial tests are necessarily. �The dengue vaccine is a new vaccine which hasn�t been used on patients for a long time. The vaccine doesn�t have a history of being used in medical practice for more than 20 or 30 years. So it�s a risk. There are instances where medicine that works for one country hasn�t proven successful in another. So a trial test has to be done on a scientific basis before officially introducing the vaccine to a country. It has to be decided whether the trial is going to be performed islandwide or in a selected province. There is an advisory committee with regard to national vaccines. The decision to be made with regard to this vaccine is up to this committee. Rather than talking about this topic while being in the dark, it�s better to obtain approval for the vaccine through a methodical manner,� he said.��On behalf of the GMOA, what I can say is, if the vaccine is to be implemented, it has to be done using a scientific basis with respect to the laws of the country and it has to be done without unnecessary delay. The vaccine has to be passed as a national policy following the act of the NMRA with its approval,� he further said.Straight from the Source� �The� approached Sanofi Pasteur, to obtain details of the vaccine. Sanofi Pasteur is the vaccines division of the French� multinational pharmaceutical company, Sanofi , deemed as one of 4� companies that produces the vaccine for yellow fever globally.Spokesperson for Sanofi Pasteur referred to background details of the vaccine which include the countries that have used the vaccine. The overall effectiveness of the vaccine in treating the dengue disease was specified. �Sanofi Pasteur dengue vaccine is the culmination of over two decades of scientific innovation and collaboration, as well as 25 clinical studies in 15 countries, involving 40,000 volunteers, around the world. Currently approved in 18 countries including Brazil, Mexico, Australia and Singapore, the dengue vaccine has been proven to be efficacious against all four serotypes that cause the disease. Pooled Phase III clinical study results among at-risk populations of 9 + years old, over a 25-month period, showed that the vaccine can prevent 8 out of 10 hospitalizations, 9 out of 10 of severe dengue cases and has an overall efficacy of 65.6%,� the spokesperson said.The vaccine has an overall effect against all four dengue serotypes. This vaccine so far has been reported safe - Professor, Arjuna De SilvaWhen the company spokesperson was asked about their approach with the vaccine to Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan response to the vaccine proposal, the spokesperson stated that the company had submitted an application to the NMRA for approval in June last year. The NMRA in response had informed the necessity of the assessment of surveillance data during a time period of one year from countries where the vaccine was implemented before it (vaccine) can be approved. �We submitted an application to obtain marketing approval to the Sri Lankan regulatory authorities in June 2016. In March 2017, the NMRA informed us that they would like to assess post-marketing surveillance data from countries in which the vaccine has been used for a period of 1 year before making a decision on approval of the vaccine. Sanofi Pasteur responded to the queries of NMRA in a letter dated April 4th, 2017 and provided long-term safety and efficacy data from clinical trials involving over 35,000 subjects and post-marketing safety surveillance. Since then, we have been closely engaged with the NMRA and await their decision on approval of the vaccine for use in Sri Lanka,� the spokesperson further said.Generally the procedure to introduce a new vaccine is something that takes time. We can�t use Sri Lankan patients as guinea pigs - GMOA Secretary, Dr. Haritha Aluthge�The spokesperson stressed on the vaccine�s performance and effectiveness accentuating its safety and high efficacy. �We have long-term data on the safety of our vaccine for 6 years post vaccination from a Phase IIB efficacy study involving 4002 subjects and for 5 and 4 years respectively from two phase III studies conducted in 10 dengue-endemic countries inAsia and Latin America involving more than 31,000 subjects. The results consistently showed a continued reduction of hospitalized dengue cases. In addition, 2 Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Reports have been published in between a 6-months interval since the post-marketing approval. These include safety data collected by Sanofi Pasteur from worldwide sources, since the vaccine�s approval in December 2015 till 07 December 2016, and do not warrant any significant Regulatory Authority actions.(e.g., restrictions in approved indications, suspensions or withdrawal of a marketing authorization, new contraindications for use, new or strengthened warnings),� the spokesperson said.The company believes that the vaccine will help make a difference in the dengue situation in the country, all the while assuring its safety and efficacy. �The long-term data on our vaccine and the post-marketing safety surveillance reassure us of the long-term efficacy and safety of the vaccine.This new tool will have a significant impact on our fight against dengue, when used along with other dengue control measures.Sanofi Pasteur stands ready to provide the vaccine to Sri Lanka and believes that this vaccine, coupled with other preventive measures, can make a difference in Sri Lanka in fighting this terrible disease,� the spokesperson added.A much provoked inquiryThe question of the delay with regard to the implementation of the vaccine in Sri Lanka is a much provoked inquiry in many a mind. But in actuality this query must be rephrased to questioning the suitability of the vaccine to be used on Sri Lankans. The question, �Are we ready for the dengue vaccine to be used in Sri Lanka?� was addressed in the Weekly Epidemiological Report issued by the Epidemiology Unit for� March 18- 24 2017� It accentuated the necessity to approach the implementation of a vaccine program using a scientific approach. The report stressed that the current disease surveillance system in Sri Lanka is inadequate to assess dengue transmission dynamics at a national and sub national level. �The current surveillance system doesn�t capture morbidity data from out-patient departments, laboratories and the community. Therefore the patients who don�t get admitted to hospitals, particularly those with mild symptoms or clinically unapparent infections are unlikely to be reported and aren�t reflected in the morbidity figures. From the inpatients too, a proportion of cases may be missed from hospitals in different parts of the country. Consequently, under reporting is a significant problem with the routine surveillance mechanism currently in place,� the report reveals.The importance of an assessment to evaluate the vulnerable ages and the serological extent of dengue transmission has also been highlighted in the epidemiology report, in attempts to recognize the state of the dengue burden. �It is important that we have an understanding of the sero-prevalence of dengue in the country or at least in the high- risk areas like western province or in the Colombo district. In this back drop, a community based descriptive study of dengue sero-epidemiology in the Colombo district is being carried out by the epidemiology unit. Age-specific dengue sero-prevalence in the metropolitan, urban and rural populations in the Colombo district will be assessed in this study,� the report states. The study will prove helpful as age-stratified sero-surveys are currently deemed as the best way to select populations suitable for vaccination. When this is directed at a sub national level, it will help guide vaccine decision making. The Epidemiology Report stated that this knowledge is acclaimed important for evidence based effective control and as preventive strategies for future introduction of the vaccine. The outcome of this study is said to be important in accurately sizing up the dengue dilemma and preventing it from wreaking havoc in the country.� �Vaccine Technicality� �Referring to the Weekly Epidemiology Report (Vol.44, No.12) issued by the Epidemiology Unit for the time period between March 18-24, 2017,� one dengue vaccine has been registered in several countries while there are several other vaccines for dengue being developed at the moment.� �When it came to effectiveness of the vaccine in the trials, it has varied from each individual and also the country. �Vaccine efficacy varied from country to country in the studies, ranging from 31.3% in Mexico to 79% in Malaysia,� the report states.� It was also further explained in the report that age and various scientific reasons such as sero-prevalence affected the effectiveness of the vaccine. Age and sero-positivity have depicted a higher correlation in the trials.� �It was further reported that during vaccine studies, an instance of an increased risk of hospitalization for dengue was seen particularly in the age group of 2-5 year olds. There have been several hypotheses to suggest the cause with regards to medical science, but nothing has been confirmed. This result led to the decision of vaccinating patients starting from the age of 9 years. The sero-positivity or sero-negativity of a dengue patient seems to have an effect on an individual�s response to the dengue vaccine. �Vaccination may be ineffective or may theoretically even increase the future risk of dengue illness in those who are sero-negative at the time of first vaccination regardless of age. If this is the case, even in high transmission settings there may be an increased risk among sero-negative persons despite a reduction in dengue illness at the population level,� the report further states. A different report revealed that vaccine efficacy was high against dengue types 3(71.6%) and 4 (76.9%) in comparison to dengue types 1 (54.7%) and 2 (43%). Vaccine efficacy was observed to be high in sero-positive individuals in comparison to sero-negative individuals. In the Asian trial of the vaccine, the efficacy for sero-positive individuals was 74.3% whereas the efficacy was 35.5% for sero-negative individuals. The Latin American trail begged to differ with higher efficacies with sero-positive acquiring 83.7% and sero-negative efficacy being 43.2%.The current surveillance system doesn�t capture morbidity data from out-patient departments, laboratories and the community� The Weekly Epidemiological Report also stated that mathematical models have been developed under various assumptions to predict the impact of dengue vaccines when administered in a routine immunization programme. The cost-effectiveness of the vaccines were also considered at in the modelling comparison. �As the cost of vaccine procurement and delivery was unknown, the analyses were presented as costs per fully vaccinated person. One DALY averted was valued at around US$ 2000 based on benchmarking the costs against alternative interventional strategies being carried out to prevent dengue. Against this benchmark, in settings with sero-prevalence in the range of 50%�90% at age 9 years, vaccination was predicted to be cost effective if the total cost of fully vaccinating one person were less than US$15�40 in the public health perspective. It should be noted, however, that the modelling comparison results were based on regional indicators and should be used as a substitute for country-specific analyses to effect local decision-making.�WHO has specified on the target groups for the vaccines. �In defining populations to be targeted for vaccination, prior infection with dengue virus of serotype, as measured by sero-prevalence, should be approximately 70% greater, in the age group targeted for vaccination, in order to maximize public health impact and cost effectiveness.� A different report stated that vaccination of populations in between the recommended age groups with sero-prevalence in the range between 50-70% is acceptable, but the impact may be lower than the desired level while the vaccination of populations with sero-prevalence below 50% is not recommended.� �The Weekly Epidemiological Report further stressed that positive effects can�t be expected from the vaccine alone and that it should be considered part of a dengue control mechanism. �Dengue vaccination introduction should be carried out as a part of comprehensive dengue control strategy, including well-executed and sustained vector control, evidence based best practices for clinical care for all patients with dengue illness, and strong dengue surveillance,� the report stresses.However it was also noted that though the dengue vaccination may be introduced as part of an overall dengue control strategy, it�s not expected to make a significant impact in the wake of an outbreak.� ��The debate regarding the vaccine was taken to the streets when the Dailymirror� made inquiries from the public to note down their opinions. This was mainly because we think that ultimately it�s the general public that must be the beneficiaries of a medical scheme that�s put to use. Citizens expressed a rainbow of views that included a dislike for the vaccine as well as those who supported it. Some opined that the implementation of a vaccine for dengue would be a good step while others harboured fears regarding the safety of the vaccine.� ���I completely agree with the implementation of a dengue vaccine. But I also think that the vaccine should be reinforced along with medical recommendations of a doctor,� said Wathsala. ���I am all for the implementation of a dengue vaccine under safety assurances. I think it will prove beneficial as a treatment for dengue which is a dreadful disease,� said Manosha Fernando� ���No, I don�t agree with a vaccine. Implementation of a vaccine isn�t child�s play. It could lead to dangerous consequences. Rather than approaching a vaccine, I think that there are many other actions that must be taken to suppress the dengue condition in the country. Though these vaccines are said to be used in countries like Singapore, we can�t ignore the fact that they are developed countries unlike Sri Lanka. So the success of the vaccine here is questionable. But if the vaccine is approved by doctors, then it could be a considerable step,�� said Christaline Fernando�The fact that the vaccine is being used in other countries is assuring. After all, most of the medicines used in Sri Lanka are from other countries as well. In any case, the vaccine would be a good thing. It would be good for the children,� said Ishan Perera� ���As a mother of two daughters, I am concerned for their safety, so I don�t agree with a vaccine if it isn�t approved by the Health Ministry and medical professionals. My daughters just recovered from dengue and I know the severity of the disease, but even so I won�t opt for a vaccine unless it�s approved medically in Sri Lanka,� said Niranjala��",dengue
Public officers should have courage to say �No� to the minister -Jinasiri Dadallage,"2017-08-04 00:15:37							0						 				2535","In a recent interview, senior civil servant Jinasiri Dadallage spoke about the public sector of the country.

However, before this institution was established, these information was communicated through several sections of the Prime Minister�s Office. Today, this institution has been formed incorporating all those sections. When we receive a complaint over some issue, we direct it to the relevant institution and follow-up to see if justice is meted out accordingly.�QDoes the Constitution provide legal authority to other entities coming under the purview of PM�s Office to give orders and follow-up the work of other state institutions?There is a possibility to follow-up action. No legal condition is required for it. It is managerial access. When people request something from the Prime Minister, it is this office that manages it. When we forward such requests to relevant institutions, we inform them of follow-up action. Then, the relevant institution is held responsible for looking at the problem.�No provision is made to pass the buck. We live in a country where poor people are directed to various institutions when they come in search of a solution to their problems. Government servants should have a responsibility on their part. The public service is established to attend to the needs of the citizens.�QAre you of the opinion that officers in the government service have no such accountability?One of our objectives is to improve accountability. When a citizen comes to us in search of a solution, we have two answers: either we are capable of solving it or we are not. If the problem cannot be addressed, then its legal position should be explained.�Accountability is one of the principles of good governance.

Has the change brought about expected results?�The appointments, promotions and transfers in the public service are done with the knowledge of the Public Service Commission. For instance, no political appointment can be made. Some politicians say the Public Service Commission has not done any work because they cannot make appointments according to their whims and fancies. As a former Public Administration Secretary, I am aware that the only power a Secretary has is to recruit drivers and peons (KKS).�Q Although the nominal situation is as such, the practical situation is different, isn�t it? There are reports of political interferences on numerous occasions�Not really. There may be political revenges. The other thing is that we cannot ignore factors like �politics.� It is the people who appoint their representatives. So it is not necessary to ignore their views. But, it can be done only on certain matters. The other thing is that we witness a �mixture� in the field of public administration.�The chairmanship of divisional development committees is held by a politico of the area; in some instances a Cabinet Minister.�I have worked with Ratnasiri Wickramanayake, Sarath Amunugama and Karu Jayasuriya for a long time. Once, I was ordered to transfer the officers of the Colombo Municipal Council, but I refused to do such a thing without any valid reason. At last that transfer could not be done. The officers should have that kind of courageIt is only through politics that we find if correct decisions are taken. In such a process, government officers are influenced to some extent. If not so, bureaucracy will reign supreme. Or else, the politician has no right to transfer a person elsewhere saying �he is not my man.��QDo you think government officers exercise sufficient independence to refuse such political involvement?They should have the ability to do so. If there are no such things, it means the officer concerned has no courage. The Ministry Secretary should have the courage to point out a wrong decision. I have worked with Ratnasiri Wickramanayake, Sarath Amunugama and Karu Jayasuriya for a long time. Once, I was ordered to transfer the officers of the Colombo Municipal Council, but I refused to do such a thing without any valid reason. At last that transfer could not be done. The officers should have that kind of courage.�Q It has been revealed that government officers are inconvenienced in performing their duties at the provincial level because LG polls were not held, especially in the case of garbage disposal and combating the Dengue epidemic. What are your thoughts?�Officers are entrusted with a huge responsibility. When politicians are present, the work is being done with double engine. It is true. I see managerial loopholes. Those who work in local government offices need to hone their managerial skills.�For instance, if the local government office informs a date, time and venue for garbage collection, the whole problem could have been solved. I lived abroad for a long time where these types of issues are barely heard of.�What we lack is knowledge on garbage management. This will be successful if it is done with the politicians and officers of the Divisional Secretariat.�QDoesn�t regime change affect the duties of government officers?�Then, the people should cast their votes to change the policies. For instance, there was a peoplisation policy in the past. Later came the privatization policy.�When there are permanent policies, they will rust. Consider the state of Socialist China today. The other thing is that if the parliament passes some policy, the successive government is compelled to implement them.�QA new constitution is being devised amidst many disagreements. Will it be successful?�The constitution is an essential constituent to a country. If there are any loopholes in the existing constitution, then it has to be changed.�There is a big hue and cry over the new constitution. What I am going to say about this matter through a managerial access is that a constitution should not be made without addressing certain changes in the present administrative pattern. For instance, we should change the constitution only after resolving the administrative problems in provincial councils.�Devising a fresh constitution would not be difficult if we ensure these institutions function properly.�",dengue
Dismay As Sri Lanka Battles Inadequacies In Implementing Dengue Vaccine,"2017-08-04 00:00:13							0						 				3136","It has become nothing but humdrum when it comes to warning the general public in taking precautions against dengue. Something that we all know, despite every measure being taken, is that the disease can�t be eradicated overnight. This has to be said in the backdrop of the inevitable number of citizens falling victim to dengue everyday. So the situation has now aggravated and more attention is being paid to dengue cures and treatments. What has become really important is to find light at the end of the tunnel and that amounts to a medically curative method. ��The good news is that the world�s first licensed dengue vaccine, approved by the World Health Organization, is available and now in use as a treatment for dengue. The�vaccine is currently been used in 18 countries. It�s also available in Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand apart from being used in other continents. The licensed dengue vaccine is a live attenuated recombinant tetravalent vaccine which is given on a 3 dose series on a 0, 6 and 12 month basis. The vaccine is recommended for people in the age range of 9 - 45 years in dengue endemic countries.�Perspective of Medical Personas �According to Professor in Medicine Arjuna De Silva, attached to the Faculty of Medicine in Ragama, the dengue vaccine seemingly is an effective method to help control dengue in the country. �The vaccine is WHO approved. The vaccine has an overall effect against all four dengue serotypes. This seems to have highly probable positive effects to help treat dengue patients and so far has been reported safe. Also 7 of the Asian countries have implemented the vaccine,� Professor De Silva said.��While a vaccine for dengue seems so essential for a country like Sri Lanka-which is now battling a dengue crisis-declaring the use of this vaccine has not been simple, hence the delay in it being used in medical �practice in the country. For the record around 300 dengue related deaths have been reported.A dengue patient receives treatment at a government hospitalWhen the reasons for the delay in the dengue vaccine were inquired from the GMOA Secretary, Dr. Haritha Aluthge, he stated that the vaccine is yet to be studied and trial tested. Aluthge said that it is only then that it can be approved for medical use in the country. He said that such trials and tests are essentianl as a possible risk entails the implementation of a new vaccine. �Before the vaccine can be used on patients, a trial test has to be done to ensure safety. We should also refer to the trial tests done in other countries. The vaccine has to be studied and trial tested before it can be used medically. There is a procedure to follow with regard to the National Medical Regulatory Authority (NMRA) of the country before approving a vaccine. The vaccines should be affirmed in terms of cost effectiveness as well. We should also consider the success rate of the vaccine in other countries. Generally the procedure to introduce a new vaccine to a country is something that takes time. We can�t use Sri Lankan patients as guinea pigs,� he warned.�Reports reveal that Sri Lankans have flown to Singapore on various occasions to get the vaccine. While opulent citizens may be able to get vaccinated, the less affluent have been left without such an opportunity in obtaining the vaccination. These happenings have led to the questioning about the delay in the use of the vaccine in Sri Lanka given that it�s already being used in a country like Singapore.�But according to Dr. Aluthge, the results of the vaccine can change from country to country. That is why trial tests are necessarily. �The dengue vaccine is a new vaccine which hasn�t been used on patients for a long time. The vaccine doesn�t have a history of being used in medical practice for more than 20 or 30 years. So it�s a risk. There are instances where medicine that works for one country hasn�t proven successful in another. So a trial test has to be done on a scientific basis before officially introducing the vaccine to a country. It has to be decided whether the trial is going to be performed islandwide or in a selected province. There is an advisory committee with regard to national vaccines. The decision to be made with regard to this vaccine is up to this committee. Rather than talking about this topic while being in the dark, it�s better to obtain approval for the vaccine through a methodical manner,� he said.���On behalf of the GMOA, what I can say is, if the vaccine is to be implemented, it has to be done using a scientific basis with respect to the laws of the country and it has to be done without unnecessary delay. The vaccine has to be passed as a national policy following the act of the NMRA with its approval,� he further said.�Straight from the Source ��The �approached Sanofi Pasteur, to obtain details of the vaccine. Sanofi Pasteur is the vaccines division of the French �multinational pharmaceutical company, Sanofi , deemed as one of 4 �companies that produces the vaccine for yellow fever globally.Spokesperson for Sanofi Pasteur referred to background details of the vaccine which include the countries that have used the vaccine. The overall effectiveness of the vaccine in treating the dengue disease was specified. �Sanofi Pasteur dengue vaccine is the culmination of over two decades of scientific innovation and collaboration, as well as 25 clinical studies in 15 countries, involving 40,000 volunteers, around the world. Currently approved in 18 countries including Brazil, Mexico, Australia and Singapore, the dengue vaccine has been proven to be efficacious against all four serotypes that cause the disease. Pooled Phase III clinical study results among at-risk populations of 9 + years old, over a 25-month period, showed that the vaccine can prevent 8 out of 10 hospitalizations, 9 out of 10 of severe dengue cases and has an overall efficacy of 65.6%,� the spokesperson said.��The vaccine has an overall effect against all four dengue serotypes. This vaccine so far has been reported safeProfessor�Arjuna De SilvaWhen the company spokesperson was asked about their approach with the vaccine to Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan response to the vaccine proposal, the spokesperson stated that the company had submitted an application to the NMRA for approval in June last year. The NMRA in response had informed the necessity of the assessment of surveillance data during a time period of one year from countries where the vaccine was implemented before it (vaccine) can be approved. �We submitted an application to obtain marketing approval to the Sri Lankan regulatory authorities in June 2016. In March 2017, the NMRA informed us that they would like to assess post-marketing surveillance data from countries in which the vaccine has been used for a period of 1 year before making a decision on approval of the vaccine. Sanofi Pasteur responded to the queries of NMRA in a letter dated April 4th, 2017 and provided long-term safety and efficacy data from clinical trials involving over 35,000 subjects and post-marketing safety surveillance. Since then, we have been closely engaged with the NMRA and await their decision on approval of the vaccine for use in Sri Lanka,� the spokesperson further said.�Generally the procedure to introduce a new vaccine is something that takes time. We can�t use Sri Lankan patients as guinea pigsGMOA Secretary, Dr. Haritha Aluthge�The spokesperson stressed on the vaccine�s performance and effectiveness accentuating its safety and high efficacy. �We have long-term data on the safety of our vaccine for 6 years post vaccination from a Phase IIB efficacy study involving 4002 subjects and for 5 and 4 years respectively from two phase III studies conducted in 10 dengue-endemic countries inAsia and Latin America involving more than 31,000 subjects. The results consistently showed a continued reduction of hospitalized dengue cases. In addition, 2 Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Reports have been published in between a 6-months interval since the post-marketing approval. These include safety data collected by Sanofi Pasteur from worldwide sources, since the vaccine�s approval in December 2015 till 07 December 2016, and do not warrant any significant Regulatory Authority actions.(e.g., restrictions in approved indications, suspensions or withdrawal of a marketing authorization, new contraindications for use, new or strengthened warnings),� the spokesperson said.�The company believes that the vaccine will help make a difference in the dengue situation in the country, all the while assuring its safety and efficacy. �The long-term data on our vaccine and the post-marketing safety surveillance reassure us of the long-term efficacy and safety of the vaccine.�This new tool will have a significant impact on our fight against dengue, when used along with other dengue control measures.Sanofi Pasteur stands ready to provide the vaccine to Sri Lanka and believes that this vaccine, coupled with other preventive measures, can make a difference in Sri Lanka in fighting this terrible disease,� the spokesperson added.�A much provoked inquiry�The question of the delay with regard to the implementation of the vaccine in Sri Lanka is a much provoked inquiry in many a mind. But in actuality this query must be rephrased to questioning the suitability of the vaccine to be used on Sri Lankans. The question, �Are we ready for the dengue vaccine to be used in Sri Lanka?� was addressed in the Weekly Epidemiological Report issued by the Epidemiology Unit for �March 18- 24 2017 �It accentuated the necessity to approach the implementation of a vaccine program using a scientific approach. The report stressed that the current disease surveillance system in Sri Lanka is inadequate to assess dengue transmission dynamics at a national and sub national level. �The current surveillance system doesn�t capture morbidity data from out-patient departments, laboratories and the community. Therefore the patients who don�t get admitted to hospitals, particularly those with mild symptoms or clinically unapparent infections are unlikely to be reported and aren�t reflected in the morbidity figures. From the inpatients too, a proportion of cases may be missed from hospitals in different parts of the country. Consequently, under reporting is a significant problem with the routine surveillance mechanism currently in place,� the report reveals.�The importance of an assessment to evaluate the vulnerable ages and the serological extent of dengue transmission has also been highlighted in the epidemiology report, in attempts to recognize the state of the dengue burden. �It is important that we have an understanding of the sero-prevalence of dengue in the country or at least in the high- risk areas like western province or in the Colombo district. In this back drop, a community based descriptive study of dengue sero-epidemiology in the Colombo district is being carried out by the epidemiology unit. Age-specific dengue sero-prevalence in the metropolitan, urban and rural populations in the Colombo district will be assessed in this study,� the report states. The study will prove helpful as age-stratified sero-surveys are currently deemed as the best way to select populations suitable for vaccination. When this is directed at a sub national level, it will help guide vaccine decision making. The Epidemiology Report stated that this knowledge is acclaimed important for evidence based effective control and as preventive strategies for future introduction of the vaccine. The outcome of this study is said to be important in accurately sizing up the dengue dilemma and preventing it from wreaking havoc in the country. ��Vaccine Technicality ��Referring to the Weekly Epidemiology Report (Vol.44, No.12) issued by the Epidemiology Unit for the time period between March 18-24, 2017, �one dengue vaccine has been registered in several countries while there are several other vaccines for dengue being developed at the moment. ��When it came to effectiveness of the vaccine in the trials, it has varied from each individual and also the country. �Vaccine efficacy varied from country to country in the studies, ranging from 31.3% in Mexico to 79% in Malaysia,� the report states. �It was also further explained in the report that age and various scientific reasons such as sero-prevalence affected the effectiveness of the vaccine. Age and sero-positivity have depicted a higher correlation in the trials. ��It was further reported that during vaccine studies, an instance of an increased risk of hospitalization for dengue was seen particularly in the age group of 2-5 year olds. There have been several hypotheses to suggest the cause with regards to medical science, but nothing has been confirmed. This result led to the decision of vaccinating patients starting from the age of 9 years. The sero-positivity or sero-negativity of a dengue patient seems to have an effect on an individual�s response to the dengue vaccine. �Vaccination may be ineffective or may theoretically even increase the future risk of dengue illness in those who are sero-negative at the time of first vaccination regardless of age. If this is the case, even in high transmission settings there may be an increased risk among sero-negative persons despite a reduction in dengue illness at the population level,� the report further states. A different report revealed that vaccine efficacy was high against dengue types 3(71.6%) and 4 (76.9%) in comparison to dengue types 1 (54.7%) and 2 (43%). Vaccine efficacy was observed to be high in sero-positive individuals in comparison to sero-negative individuals. In the Asian trial of the vaccine, the efficacy for sero-positive individuals was 74.3% whereas the efficacy was 35.5% for sero-negative individuals. The Latin American trail begged to differ with higher efficacies with sero-positive acquiring 83.7% and sero-negative efficacy being 43.2%.The current surveillance system doesn�t capture morbidity data from out-patient departments, laboratories and the community��The Weekly Epidemiological Report also stated that mathematical models have been developed under various assumptions to predict the impact of dengue vaccines when administered in a routine immunization programme. The cost-effectiveness of the vaccines were also considered at in the modelling comparison. �As the cost of vaccine procurement and delivery was unknown, the analyses were presented as costs per fully vaccinated person. One DALY averted was valued at around US$ 2000 based on benchmarking the costs against alternative interventional strategies being carried out to prevent dengue. Against this benchmark, in settings with sero-prevalence in the range of 50%�90% at age 9 years, vaccination was predicted to be cost effective if the total cost of fully vaccinating one person were less than US$15�40 in the public health perspective. It should be noted, however, that the modelling comparison results were based on regional indicators and should be used as a substitute for country-specific analyses to effect local decision-making.�WHO has specified on the target groups for the vaccines. �In defining populations to be targeted for vaccination, prior infection with dengue virus of serotype, as measured by sero-prevalence, should be approximately 70% greater, in the age group targeted for vaccination, in order to maximize public health impact and cost effectiveness.� A different report stated that vaccination of populations in between the recommended age groups with sero-prevalence in the range between 50-70% is acceptable, but the impact may be lower than the desired level while the vaccination of populations with sero-prevalence below 50% is not recommended. ��The Weekly Epidemiological Report further stressed that positive effects can�t be expected from the vaccine alone and that it should be considered part of a dengue control mechanism. �Dengue vaccination introduction should be carried out as a part of comprehensive dengue control strategy, including well-executed and sustained vector control, evidence based best practices for clinical care for all patients with dengue illness, and strong dengue surveillance,� the report stresses.�However it was also noted that though the dengue vaccination may be introduced as part of an overall dengue control strategy, it�s not expected to make a significant impact in the wake of an outbreak. ���The debate regarding the vaccine was taken to the streets when the Dailymirror� made inquiries from the public to note down their opinions. This was mainly because we think that ultimately it�s the general public that must be the beneficiaries of a medical scheme that�s put to use. Citizens expressed a rainbow of views that included a dislike for the vaccine as well as those who supported it. Some opined that the implementation of a vaccine for dengue would be a good step while others harboured fears regarding the safety of the vaccine. ����I completely agree with the implementation of a dengue vaccine. But I also think that the vaccine should be reinforced along with medical recommendations of a doctor,��said Wathsala. �� ���I am all for the implementation of a dengue vaccine under safety assurances. I think it will prove beneficial as a treatment for dengue which is a dreadful disease,��said Manosha Fernando ����No, I don�t agree with a vaccine. Implementation of a vaccine isn�t child�s play. It could lead to dangerous consequences. Rather than approaching a vaccine, I think that there are many other actions that must be taken to suppress the dengue condition in the country. Though these vaccines are said to be used in countries like Singapore, we can�t ignore the fact that they are developed countries unlike Sri Lanka. So the success of the vaccine here is questionable. But if the vaccine is approved by doctors, then it could be a considerable step,��said Christaline Fernando���The fact that the vaccine is being used in other countries is assuring. After all, most of the medicines used in Sri Lanka are from other countries as well. In any case, the vaccine would be a good thing. It would be good for the children,��said Ishan Perera ����As a mother of two daughters, I am concerned for their safety, so I don�t agree with a vaccine if it isn�t approved by the Health Ministry and medical professionals. My daughters just recovered from dengue and I know the severity of the disease, but even so I won�t opt for a vaccine unless it�s approved medically in Sri Lanka,��said Niranjala ���",dengue
LIBERALISM WITHOUT DEMOCRACY,"2017-08-02 01:20:35							0						 				1942","The worst thing about Hambantota is Trincomalee. The Chinese are not our neighbours; we have no border with China and thus no deeply inscribed history of incursions and annexation; there is no Chinese minority on the island and China never intervened in our conflicts or supported cross-border terrorism. The real danger about Hambantota is that the Indians, whose underbelly is Tamil Nadu, will feel it necessary to redouble the squeeze on this puppet government which is greedy, bankrupt and spineless. This is not the UNP of President Premadasa, the author of �Golu Muhuda�, who sent back the 70,000-strong IPKF. ��The real battleground is Trincomalee and the surrounding North and East, which is 18 miles from Tamil Nadu. That�s the decisive looming battle. If, as the Sri Lankan PM has promised the Indian PM in writing (Minister Malik Samarawickrama signed the MoU for GoSL), the Trinco oil tank farm, the �development� of the Port, and the Mannar�Trinco/Mannar-Kilinochchi highways are given to the Indians, ETCA signed, and the North and East granted quasi-federal powers through a Constitutional change, this island would permanently lose control over its Northeastern periphery-cum-buffer. As a state, we would become geopolitically smaller and more vulnerable to our giant neighbour. ��In Mexico, the Zapatistas led by the enigmatic, iconic Subcommandante Marcos in his ski-mask, began their almost bloodless armed uprising on the day in 1994 that NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was signed�and the existential threat posed by NAFTA to Mexico was far less than that posed either by ETCA or the acquisition of Trincomalee by India. Where are the 21st century Puran Appus? ��Meanwhile, have you noticed that every major, mainstream political formation in Sri Lanka had controversies in the past several weeks? The TNA had a problem with the NPC and Wigneswaran; the UNP members of the Cabinet lined up for and against UNP Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe�s stout defence of Sri Lanka against hostile UN officials; Weerawansa�s NFF rocked the JO boat by criticizing participation in the Steering Committee on constitutional change; the SLFP and UNP contradictions are growing; and the official SLFP has dissenters who are threatening to quit the government in the next few weeks. These are but symptoms of the crisis spreading. ��A Sinhala language journalist, a young university graduate with an honours degree, interviewed me extensively the other day for a periodical. As I criticized the government for the shutdown of the local authorities, she quietly interrupted me to say that her kid brother had died of dengue because fumigation by the local authorities had stopped-- adding that another youngster, a student of Moratuwa University, had been turned away by the hospital as his platelet count had not yet descended to the level that is now deemed necessary for admission to overcrowded hospitals. The lad returned to his boarding and died the next day. ��How many more people will die of diseases and manmade disasters when the government succeeds in postponing Provincial Council elections, with the attendant crippling of the essential health and welfare functions carried out by those elected authorities? Taken together with the non-holding of local authorities� elections, the postponement of provincial council elections will paralyze the state system from the waist down. The System isn�t working�and it�s the government�s fault. ��A sagacious government usually calls an election of some sort to let off the steam, divide the opposition and retard its momentum. This government has postponed local government elections for over two years and continues to do so, while preparing to postpone the Provincial Council elections as well. This further delegitimizes the government while continuing to channel dissent onto the streets rather than into the polling booth. ��What are the roots of the crisis? ��Polarizing policies: the policies of the government are not those which lend themselves to a stable consensus or even equilibrium between the two wings of the government. Instead the policies are so far out in right field that the constitutional policies sharpen the contradictions between the UNP and official SLFP; the economic policies have led to a backlash from the SLFP unions, caused a visible fissure within the official SLFP and will a probably trigger a breakaway in a few weeks; the external policies (e.g. Geneva) have led to open dissent even within the UNP. ��Polarizing personalities & discourse: Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and a handful of Ministers (Mangala, Kiriella, Rajitha, and Fonseka) have a confrontational style and discourse which causes polarization in and out of parliament and triggers a backlash from the most diverse social sectors, from secular radical students to fundamentalist Buddhist clergy. The government is creating its own siege. ��Bipolar disorder and the crisis of the model: the so-called unity government is bipolar and there is a Cold War between the UNP and the �official� SLFP centering on the very model of the state itself, with the UNP pushing for the abolition of the executive presidency and introduction of de facto federalism or at least the dilution of the unitary state, while the SLFP by contrast argues for the retention of the unitary state and the executive presidency and advocates moderate constitutional amendments, not complete replacement. ��Crisis of representation and legitimacy: The results of the August 2015 general election have not been respected and have been tampered with, post facto. The UNP obtained 106 members, the SLFP running on a platform against a coalition with the UNP, won 95. Instead of mirroring this verdict, a coalition was formed with the UNP through top-down manipulation. Adding insult to injury, the 52 members of the Opposition who remained faithful to their August 2015 mandate were not recognized as the Parliamentary Opposition and the 16 member TNA holds the post of Opposition Leader. �As the government moves to implement its polarizing policies, protests will proliferate. A single violent death or crippling at the hands of the government, and protests from below will render the place chronically ungovernable. The Rajapaksa administration functioned as that well-known post-Cold War phenomenon, an illiberal democracy. However, if the regular holding of elections and the respect for a functioning, competitive two party system is the hallmark of a liberal democracy, then the Yahapalana administration is either (a) more liberal than it is democratic or (b) is neither liberal nor democratic. ��While neoliberalism can be implemented in the developed West within a liberal democratic system and the fallout contained within it even as it causes social crises, in the global South by contrast, the neoliberal economic agenda can be taken to the extremes that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe wants to, only within an undemocratic political system. In countries of the global South, economic free-market fundamentalism cannot accommodate an untrammelled political free market; it needs the shutdown of a competitive political marketplace. ��A single violent death or crippling at the hands of the government, and protests from below will render the place chronically ungovernableThis is why the PM and his cohort of co-thinkers are attempting to wrest power through Constitutional change. This is why the TNA and not the JO is the official Opposition, and Sampanthan, not Dinesh, is the Opposition Leader. This is why the UNP hopes to enable land sales to multinational corporations through quasi-federalization of Provincial Councils.This is why the Tamil Diaspora is more of an ally for the UNP than is the SLFP. This is why Ministers are bought up with Diaspora �black money�. This is why there is a creeping institutional coup and choke points within the State apparatuses are being occupied by pro-UNP, pro-US-India personnel, encircling and besieging President Sirisena. This is why the war winning military is seen as an enemy and the Geneva resolutions have been co-sponsored. This is why local government and Provincial Council elections will be repeatedly postponed. This is why goons, the police and the STF are unleashed to suppress student and trade union dissent. None of this will end well. ��",dengue
Brand new system of governance  in the offing - Ranil,"2017-07-29 03:13:47							0						 				1075","The premier speaking at the 17th Dudley Senanayake memorial lecture� reveals that the constitutional assembly will have to take some important decisions in the near future��Many suggest that we return to the Soulbury Constitution�- Prime minister Ranil WickremesinghePrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday indicated thatSri Lanka may usher in a new system of governance as per the new constitution as circumstances don�t allow the country to return to a West Minister system which existed until the 1970s. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these comments at the Dudley Senanayake memorial lecture organized by Dudley Senanayake Foundation together with Friedrich Naumann Stiftung Fur die Freiheit at Temple Trees. The premier said the constitutional assembly will have to take some important decisions in the near future.� ��Many suggest that we return to the Soulbury Constitution, but it may be difficult to return to this system of governance which existed until early 1970s. I say this because the parties have committed themselves to the maximum devolution of power unlike those days where the Government agents represented the state at the village level. However, today, there is a provincial council system. One has to consider the relationship between the periphery and the provincial councils. How do we share power between them? These are important issues. In a devolved government the first thing to be considered is the relationship between the central executive and the provincial executive,� Wickremesinghe said. ��Areas under discussion are the executive presidency and how to increase the power of Parliament, so that it could control the government. How to steer a government that is under the control of Parliament?. There are some parties who want the executive presidency to be abolished and others who want it retained. There are some others who want to return to a system based on Soulbury Constitution,� he added. ���""Around the past ten years we have seen the strengthening of the presidency""��Around the past ten years we have seen the strengthening of the presidency. We saw the strengthening of the presidency, expect during the time I was the Prime Minister under President Kumaranatunga. Since 2005 the presidency has been strengthened at the expense of Parliament. The House actually suffered. As a result the country fell into a deep debt. The debt the country has to repay has exceeded Rs 4 trillion. We found the chief justice being removed without going through an impeachment process. There was no resolution to remove the Chief Justice. We saw Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka being put in jail. We thought then that we should do away with the Executive presidency. That brought many forces together and a constitutional assembly was subsequently appointed. Before doing that the 19 amendment was brought in and some powers of the executive presidency were removed. We will have to see whether there should be a Parliament controlled government and what are the powers which an executive president should hold, whether the Prime Minister is directly elected or should we go for the US style where the party which obtains a majority of seats in Parliament gets to appoint the premier, or the Prime Minister is appointed through a confidence vote. Then we have to think of the electoral system. Are we to adopt the New Zealand system where 60% percent of the seats are elected under first past the post system and the rest are named under the electoral lists? These are the issues we have to discuss and decide upon. ���""I say this because the parties have committed themselves to the maximum devolution of power unlike those days where the Government agents represented the state at the village level""�Six sub committees of the constitutional assembly have submitted their reports Thereafter an interim report will be presented to the assembly and, after a debate, a final decision will be taken,� Wickremesinghe further said. �The Premier paid a glowing tribute to his predecessor the late Senanayake and recalled how he got to know the late leader in the 1950s when he was just a student. �During the time of Late Dudley Senanayake there was a different model of government. The late President Jayewardene proposed the introduction of an executive presidency in the 1960s, but Senanayake opposed it. Senanayake maintained that the existing system was best for Sri Lanka. Senanayake resigned from the UNP earlier in the 1950s and late Sir John Kotelawala became the leader of the UNP. He returned to politics later and led the UNP to victory in 1960 and in 1964 during which Sirimavo Bandaranaike�s government was defeated in Parliament when she tried to introduce a press council bill. Senanayake led the UNP to victory in 1965. Then came the Kalutara resolution where UNP accepted democratic socialism as a style of government,� he recalled�Pix by: Kushan Pathiraja��We don�t want a repeat of 1953�- State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene�State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene, in his speech, compared the times of Premier Senanayake-who took full responsibility for the unfortunate incidents in the 1950s-with the period when the previous regime existed when he payed tribute to the late leader. He said the following in his speech. He also lauded the current premier as well.� ��First and foremost on behalf of the Dudley Senanayake Foundation I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe for accepting our invitation to be the guest speaker at this event. Sir, we are truly humbled by your presence, inspired by your words and I can�t think of a more fitting person to invite to deliver the keynote speech in memory of the late Dudley Senanayake. I say this cause I believe that you share the same principles and values as the Late Prime Minister. No matter what obstacles and pressures that you have faced and experienced, you haven�t let that experience compromise your principles in any way.� �Your style of governance is much aligned to that of President J.R. Jayewardene. However your liberal values and democratic ideals are quite similar to that of Dudley Senanayake. But the similarities aren�t only restricted to values and ideals, but stretch to certain decisions and action you have taken throughout your career. �Senanayake was a man of principles. He was not hungry for power, nor did he allow ambition to drive him. He had a genuine love for his country and his people. Take for example the crossover of Deputy Prime Minister C.P. De Silva to the opposition in 1964. It led to the toppling of Bandaranayake�s SLFP government which resulted in an election that saw the UNP win with a comfortable majority.Senanayake promptly offered the post of Prime Minister to C.P De Silva for he believed that it was solely due to C.Ps defection to the UNP that resulted in their win at the elections. Seldom do you find a politician who would offer his opportunity- to serve in the highest post of the land- to another, especially after a win. In a similar fashion, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, as the Leader of the United National Party took a step back and supported the then General secretary of the SLFP Maithripala Sirisena to come forward as the common candidate for the Presidential Elections in 2015. ���""No one has come forward to take responsibility for the death of Roshan Chanaka, Thajudeen, LasanthaWicramatunge and Eknaligoda and countless others""�The civil disobedience against the UNP Government in 1953 saw an escalation of violence, sabotage and destruction of government infrastructure across the island. The clashes that erupted between the police and demonstrators resulted in 10 casualties. The very next day Dudley Senanayake resigned as Prime Minister. As Prime Minister he saw it as his duty to take responsibility for their deaths. He couldn�t bear the fact that 10 valuable lives were lost under his tenure.� �Fast forward to 2013, to the town of Rathupaswela. Residents of the area demonstrated against a factory they believed was contaminating their ground water supply. The then government sent in the army to quell the demonstrators and as a result 3 young persons died of gunshot injuries. Till this day no one from the previous regime has come forward to take responsibility for the loss of those innocent lives. Similarly no one has come forward to take responsibility for the death of Roshan Chanaka, Thajudeen, LasanthaWicramatunge and Eknaligoda and countless others who went missing during the time of the conflict. �From 2013 we come to the present times where we are experiencing a very similar environment to that of the Hartal in 1953, with civil disobedience, trade union action and demonstrations becoming a daily occurrence. They have caused much hardship to the general public. Doctors are striking for reasons that aren�t related to their profession while an upsurge of dengue hospitalizes more than 100,000 patients and leaves 300 dead. Students who take advantage of the free education that is provided to them by the state- through taxes paid by you and I- are demonstrating against private universities and blocking roads and challenging the police. The trade unions are threatening to disrupt work in their respective field.� �All this has caused inconvenience and placed a huge burden on the public, so much so that some are questioning whether �yahapalnaya� works? Critics have gone further and state that democracy doesn�t suit a country like Sri Lanka. They say they wish to see the previous regime back in power, clearly not thinking things through. But this is the sentiment of many. It�s time for tough action. Obviously we don�t want a repeat of 1953, but tougher action within a legal framework must be taken against elements that are determined to create social unrest for their political gain.� ���""They say they wish to see the previous regime back in power, clearly not thinking things through. But this is the sentiment of many. It�s time for tough action""�Israel I believe, has a good method when dealing with trade unions. while trade unions in Israel are very powerful, however by law, they are bound to give notice to the state 14 days prior to the commencement of a strike. This gives the state two weeks to negotiate and redress the issues of the unions. �Ladies and gentlemen What I have mentioned before are but a few examples of Dudley Senanayake�s character that we can all learn from. It weren�t power and prestige he was seeking, but how well he can use the power of his office to serve his country and his fellow man. Abraham Lincoln once said and I quote �Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man�s character, give him power�.� Dudley Senanayake never misused his office for his personal benefit. Even when his health was failing, he insisted that his doctors fees and travel expenses� be paid by his personal funds and not by the funds allocated to the Prime Ministers office by the state. He never surrounded himself with armed guards and back-up vehicles, rather he preferred to drive on his own. This is the conduct of an outstanding statesman that present day politicians should aspire to. �I believe we shouldn�t measure the character of a leader by the power he or she retains, or by the number of years they remain in power, but by the principles they live by and by their actions. Dwight D Eisenhower once said, � The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it�s on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office.� he said in his speech.���Dudley was a remarkable orator�- D M Swaminathan Chairman Dudley Senanayake memorial Trust�Minister D.M Swaminathan too began by stating that there are similarities between the late Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake and the current Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe. But he said that there was only one difference and that was Senanayake was an old Thomian while Premier Wickremesinghe is an old Royalist. Swaminathan made these comments in a lighter vein.� �Paying a glowing tribute to Senanayake, he said the late Prime Minister was a member of BAR after completion of his studies but that was before taking up politics. �He was a remarkable orator and had a character of his own compared to the others in Parliament at that time like the late Colvin R De Silva, Dr N M Perera and S W R D Bandaranaike. Premier Senanayake was once stopped by a traffic constable and he congratulated this constable for upholding the law. This is why he scored more than other politicians during his time. ���""Premier Senanayake was once stopped by a traffic constable and he congratulated this constable for upholding the law""�While mentioning that Senanayake was an eligible bachelor, Swaminathan went on to relate a story as to how the late leader got about looking for a suitable bride at the Ratwatte Walauwa in Balangoda. �While the Senanayakes were having Watalappan for dessert, after dinner, the parents asked Senanayake�s opinion of the young lady they came to meet. Then Senanayake replied to his parents saying �hari shook, hari shook� (very good very good when translated to English). Then his mother wanted to reconfirm Senanayake�s opinion on the bride as she wanted to make sure that her son will soon bring the young lady to to their home. She posed the question and Senanayake again gave the identical reply.� Senanayake�s mother was happy. Then Senanayake said �no amma I referred to the watalapan when I said �hari shook hari shook�. There would have been a UNP SLFP joint government if late Senanayake married that young lady from the Ratwatte Walvuwa,� Swaminathan said in a lighter vein.��""The parents asked Senanayake�s opinion of the young lady they came to meet.

At the time Sunday Lankadeepa sat down to interview the minister, there was a protest being staged against SAITM in front of his ministry. Following are excerpts of the interview done with Dr. Senaratne.��	I believe the GMOA is suffering from a headache	This country is in this state because �of low politics	It�s the union members who destroy their own unions	It�s not important to me what vociferous people have to say about dengue or the constitution	The �doctors �who were in the GMOA those days were leaders�Do you think that the SAITM problem is over? ���I can�t say that we have sorted out this problem to the very end. ����The reason? ��The problem regarding the Neville Fernando hospital has been sorted out to a large extent. Right now we are working on appointing a board to aid the functions of the hospital. This hospital should start functioning as a government teaching hospital from 1st August. All the necessary arrangements are being made for that. In the mean time a chairperson has to be appointed to the Medical  Board. I expect to finalize these matters with SAITM. We hope to fulfill the promises �we have made in connection with sorting out the SAITM issue. ����What is the reply to the question regarding the standards SAITM has to maintain? ��The minimum standard that SAITM must maintain has been sent to the Attorney General�s Department. I will gazette the particulars immediately when they send me back the translation. Once these issues are sorted out SAITM can function as an institute that offers a standardized education. But �there is another question connected to the SAITM issue. ���What is that? ���At present two batches of medical students graduated from SAITM. We are expecting to give them a special training in government hospitals. ���Why will they be given a special training? ��These two batches didn�t receive enough clinic training due to the lack of sufficient patients. We expect to give them a six month training and subject them to an interview. It�s only then that we will register them in the Medical Council. ����People are saying that the Neville Fernando Hospital wasn�t acquired.Then, What has been acquired? ����People say that the Neville �Fernando Hospital been leased out for 10 years. � ��Mad? Where is such a thing stated? ����The problem regarding the Neville Fernando hospital has been sorted out to a large extent. Right now we are working on appointing a board to aid the functions of the hospital.��The GMOA says so? ��I believe the GMOA is suffering from a headache. We are functioning in the manner of a working government. This institute is not a GMOA. �There is a system in which a government works. How can someone talk about a lease when an institute has been taken over by the government? �These people can�t make statements the way they want. When the Indo-Lanka �peace accord was signed, it was said that people from one province will need visas to enter another province. When a Provincial Council was formed there were views that it would be a separate country. People said things like this. This country is in this state because �of low  politics. So called intellectuals who promote low quality politics �are not viewing things through a professional eye. They are viewing things through the eyes of politics. They engage in baseless talk.���Their main slogan is to nationalize SAITM ��Whose is that slogan? ����It belongs to the force that�s opposing SAITM ��There are two parts to this. There is no need to have discussions with the President, Prime Minister and us if their motive is to nationalize SAITM. �����Does that mean that the government has no expectation to nationalize SAITM ? ��The answer very clearly is no. Our idea at present is not to privatize anything. The government is sticking to its stance that it won�t bring any private institution under state ownership. ����But those who protest against SAITM reverberate that this institute should be privatized. This is their slogan. � �That slogan belongs to students. The Peratugami Party and JVPers support these slogans. It is difficult to function a government with these parties. If their slogans are worth anything they should have won. Has the JVP won a seat so far at any election?. Were they able to obtain even a second place? ����I believe the GMOA is suffering from a headache. We are functioning in the manner of a working government. This institute is not a GMOA. �There is a system in which a government works��JVP won 10 seats by contesting in the election alone. In second election they won 16 seats. That was possible due to the election system introduced by President J.R. Jayewardene. What else can be said about them? The Peratugami Party will face this problem even �in the future. There�s no need of a government, if we govern the country considering the wishes of parties which obtains less than 1% or 2% of the votes. ����You are trying to conveniently forget the history associated with you where you tried to safeguard a private medical college because you were the leading person behind the struggle to nationalize the Colombo North Medical College. ���On that day.... You must study the content in my speeches on that day. Recently they posted my �speeches on their web site. One thing that I have �stated in these speeches is about the qualifications of the students recruited to this college. The next one is that the degree offered at the Colombo �Campus should be offered to students at the Colombo North Medical College. That was the clear standpoint of �GMOA and the Government Dentist Association. JVP and the Inter University Students� Union supported the slogan to nationalize the Colombo North Medical College. I didn�t have a great need even during that period to �nationalize institutions. ����The GMOA alleges that you are making attempts weaken the GMOA. ��The GMOA is already weakened. About a thousand specialist doctors have left the GMOA. A Union  of Specialist Medical Officers has been already established. There  are other  Medical Unions in addition to the GMOA. There is a Medical Officers Union in the JVP too.They also attend meetings. They are working well with them. Then there is another Medical Officer�s Union which bears some other name. They all were there. ����But You played a game here. ��No. I was invited to attend their meetings. So I used to attend every meeting of the  unions. I attended the meeting of �the Nursing Union organised by Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera. I also �participate in the Nursing Union meeting organised by Saman Rathnapriya. I participate in the meetings of every �Labour Union. I participate in all Union Meetings when I am invited. That is the duty of the Minister of Health. I don�t care about factions. They must solve these issues by themselves. They must know how to keep their unions altogether. On that day,they tried to weaken my union. That �was the UNP Government. I defeated it. I did it by doing things independently and professionally. I �carried on a sole union.That union is still going strong, alone. You should know how to administrate �your union properly. No minister can destroy a union. It�s the union members who destroy their own unions.���You as Health Minister have failed to avert the dengue tragedy from turning onto a menace. ��Okay, then please tell me the name of a minister who has succeeded in his battle against this dengue menace. Going on these lines, the health Ministers of America, Singapore and Malaysia have also failed in addressing the dengue issue. The position of dengue in these countries is worse than here. Look at countries like Vietnam and  Laos. These are nations which administer a communist regime. If so, ministers of �these countries must also fail. ����Are you saying that your have succeeded? ��If the ministers can control dengue, then there is no need to do anything. Then I can control dengue from here and stop all other duties. A person must have some brains to ask this question. ����I have referred this question to the Minister of Health in this country. ���What is the programme initiated to control dengue? Does that programme come under the Ministry of Health? Every  where plans are carried out to clear waste and this is done under a national programme. We don�t have to do all these things. We can control it like in Malaysia. We can control Malaria like that. ����Q So doesn�t the Health Ministry have any connection with dengue? Where is larva? Where is �bacteria? You promised to bring these. ��Everything has already been brought. The relevant minister is coming. He will discuss matters with us. Am I right? We are going to hold discussions with the Australian Minister during the Presidential Election. These programmes can�t be implemented immediately. But we must seek long term solutions to this problem. What are the long term solutions and how can we keep a check on this problem on a day to day basis. Bacteria has offered the only �solution. It has been produced in Australia. We must study it. Next we must probe our mosquito. The research done regarding our mosquito is still in the labs. We must present this information processed in our laboratories to the public. These scientists won�t conduct research if we laugh at �them. ����You are keen on establishing a new constitution, but that same keenness is not shown in the attempts to alleviate dengue. ��It�s not important to me what vociferous people have to say about dengue or the constitution. I have been commended for controlling this menace. The World Health Organization (WHO) has commended me that I have done my part properly while serving the �Ministry of Health. ���What other certificate matters to me? WHO is the only institute through which a Minister of Health can reach �the world. Nobody else can do this. There are specialists in every section serving the WHO. These specialists have come here and declared that the minimum dengue death toll is reported here. I can alleviate the �mosquito. But I can�t stop the breeding of mosquitoes. I can alleviate the grown mosquito. I �can take preventive measures regarding patients. Comparatively to the dengue patients, the death toll is �lesser than 3 point. According to WHO this figure indicates that our work is good. ���I don�t care about factions. They must solve these issues by themselves. They must know how to keep their unions altogether. On that day,they tried to weaken my union. That �was the UNP Government.���The GMOA says that the Ministry of Health has presented false reports, concealing the number of dengue patients and the number of deaths. ��We can�t conceal them (Reports). Things will be exposed. Every census is done. That is  why the office of �WHO is in Colombo. These doctors working in the field of health are still in the primary level. The �doctors �who were in the GMOA those days were leaders. They had a sound knowledge about  these things. Today there are leaders who know �little and �speak a lot. They don�t know that the WHO has spent millions to establish an office here �and are �working here. We are making reports by following their system and tallying with their data. �That is why the WHO makes available all statistical reports regarding health to the world. Am I right? Why  don�t they give permission to publish this in North Korea? That�s because there is no permission to probe what�s published. ����Allegations are made against the government that war heroes who did yeoman service to the nation during the war are to be send to prison to satisfy the Tamil Diaspora? ���Who are these war heroes? ����The nearest example I can give about them is Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayaka of Navy. ��In the investigations carried out, it has been proven whether these arrested people are war heroes or murderers. I obtained all the reports from the CID and read them. It will be proved further in the near future. ����It�s stated in the month of September, 18-20 ministers will leave the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. ��I don�t think that such a number will leave the party. We will wait for that time and see what we should do. But �the government is running the show. When the murderers and plunderers are punished, then those who quit the government will return. ����Is there a plan by the government to arrest Gotabaya Rajapaksa and also deprive the civic rights of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa? ��Civic rights will not be deprived by the courts. Punishments are given by the courts. Those  punishments will be meted out. ���",dengue
"O Zorro, Zorro, wherefore art thou Zorro?","2017-07-27 01:13:13							1						 				1674","There�s a singular vacancy in this country, according to some. Ranil Amirtthiah of the popular local band �Black,� whenever he speaks and in whatever forum he chooses to do so, is often poetic but sometimes he flushes subtlety down the tube. He says it straight from the heart, always. This is clearly evident in a vacancy ad he posted a few hours ago. ��Post: Sri Lankan ZORRO. Area of work: Colombo and suburbs. Job description: to terrorize those �selfish Essential Service blackmailers�, whip them and show them the righteous path of service to the nation. Salary: the entire nations gratitude. �For those who may not be familiar with the name and legend, here�s a wiki-intro: ��Zorro (Spanish for �fox�) is the secret identity of Don Diego de la Vega, a fictional character created in 1919 by pulp writer Johnston McCulley. He is a Californian nobleman living in Los Angeles during the era of Mexican rule (between 1821 and 1846),[1] although some movie adaptations of Zorro�s story have placed him during the earlier Spanish rule. The character has undergone changes through the years, but the typical image of him is a dashing black-clad masked outlaw who defends the commoners and indigenous peoples of the land against tyrannical officials and other villains. Not only is he too cunning and fox-like for the bumbling authorities to catch, but he also delights in publicly humiliating them.Ranil was of course referring to the current strike by Ceylon Petroleum Corporation workers which is inconveniencing a lot of people, especially those who own vehicles. �Throw them out,� is a call that has gathered momentum with respect to striking workers. It is a call that has found some currency in certain circles with respect to striking doctors as well. ��Not all the objectors to strikes are regime-defenders, let us acknowledge this first up. It is about inconvenience and it is about outrage; anger about services considered to be �essential�. Let us also remember that many of those who are today saluting the Government for �sending in the Army� were chest-beating moral-high-horse objectors when the previous regime opted for such strategies. One might bet that should the petroleum workers resist and resistance was met with force leading to two or three or more being killed, the very same people who cried with horror over the Rathupaswala killings would say �the hooligans deserved it!� Yes, it is a story about political loyalties and the moralizing doesn�t quite hide the fact. The more honest among the advocates of force have demonstrated some nostalgia for the preferred opposition-quelling methods of the previous regime (sans white vans, the advocates hastily add). That tells a story. ��Now one could argue that this �Zorro-Option� need not be unleashed only on striking workers but on all those who err including politicians and everyone benefiting from or supporting a system that is flawedLet�s ignore the political colour of all this. Let us focus on the scenario sans loyalty. It boils down to hope or versions of the same hope: a (benevolent) dictator. Not too many people are stopping in their tracks to ask themselves, �wait a minute, wasn�t yahapalanaya (good governance) about better systems and not about personalities?� ��Ranil has not spelled out �dictator�. He has instead called for a hero who will dash in, whip the pants off the rascals, offer infinite relief to long-suffering citizens and dash out. Just like that! ��Now one could argue that this �Zorro-Option� need not be unleashed only on striking workers but on all those who err including politicians and everyone benefiting from or supporting a system that is flawed, makes for the making of dictators and containing all kinds of loopholes for theft and the escape of thieves. The problem is that is focuses on individuals and not systems. If our hero, as he rides into the proverbial sunset, deigns to look back, he will no doubt find a flawed system more or less intact. ��Here�s another FB post that gives perspective: 1) No petrol in the sheds; 2) Doctors on strike; 3) When they are not on strike there is still a dearth of medicines; 4) People are dying daily from Dengue; 5) There is no proper solid waste disposal system; 6) The forests are being cut down but the President proudly says the Environmental Ministry is under him; 7) There is cocaine instead of regular retail goods in SATHOSA containers; 8) When a politician is found guilty of wrongdoing he is fined Rs.2,000; 9) The failed Uma Oya Project is rendering people homeless and 10) The Parliament approves leasing of Hambantota Harbour to China. So much more can be added to this. For example, the �logic� of lumping lotteries with foreign affairs and of course the hilarious case of the continued pampering of those implicated in the Central Bank bond scam. The question is, can one Zorro clean it all up? How many Zorros would we need, to put it another way? �A better leader or better leadership would go a long way in curing the country of at least some of these ills, one could argue. This is why there are some who call not for a Zorro but for a Gota (that�s Gotabaya Rajapaksa). Yes, the term �benevolent dictator� is often used when this �option� is discussed. It�s a hope, obviously and as is typical not a hope that can be obtained from track-record. However, we have to recognize the fact that one individual is not a front. One Zorro might make for cheers and some relief, but adventurers, Robin Hoods, brigands and troubadours, romantic as they obviously are, have seldom changed systems or altered the course of history. At best they offer or make a name or a political moment respectively to a process of system-change already in motion. In the terms of the political scientist, they give a name to a moment when objective preconditions mature to the point of significant social upheaval. ��This is why we need to debate individual heroes versus collective effort. Bertold Brecht in �Leben des Galilei� (Life of Galileo) elaborated on this �Zorror Wish.� Andrea Sarti tells the would-be Zorro, i.e. Galileo Galilei, �Unhappy is the land that has no hero.� And Galileo Zorro, if you will, responds, �No, Andrea; unhappy is the land that needs a hero.� ��Of course we can call for �Zorro.� We might even get �Zorro.� We will cheer when Zorro dashes in, but the Zorros in real life don�t ride off into the sunset, they transform into quite un-Zorro-like entities. No cheering then. As for those who doubt, I invite them to reflect on the Zorros of the past: e.g. Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sarath Fonseka, Velupillai Prabhakaran, SWRD Bandaranaike, JR Jayewardena, Maithripala Sirisena, Chandrika Kumaratunga, Rohana Wijeweera, Ranil Wickremesinghe and (how could we forget?) Yahapalanaya!",dengue
What in place of lunch sheets and �silli silli� bags,"2017-07-27 01:09:48							2						 				2607","The Government has decided to ban the use of polythene and rigifoam from September as one of the measures to reduce the quantity of garbage countrywide and as a measure to protect the environment. The short notice for the implementation of the polythene and rigiform ban by the government might have been prompted by the garbage crisis that erupted following the collapse of the 300-foot Meethotamulla garbage mountain on National New Year�s Day this year and the unprecedented spread of dengue. ��Needless to say that the garbage issue has turned into a crisis mainly because of the use of polythene, cellophane, rigifoam, plastic and other non-decomposable material and the improper methods used to dispose them by the people. However, finding a direct link between the garbage crisis and this year�s unprecedented increase in the number of dengue patients might not be an easy task. ��Never before has the number of dengue patients exceeded the 50,000 mark. However, for the past seven months this year the number had gone past 100,000 and shows no signs of receding or reducing. It is clear that the increase in non-decomposable trash does not correspond with the unprecedented increase in the number of dengue patients, in spite of discarded non-decomposable material definitely contributing to the spread of the disease by facilitating water clogging and thereby mosquito breeding. ��Nevertheless, the garbage problem has created so many issues in the recent months, ranging from health issues to social unrest. Therefore, it is no doubt that the decision by the government to ban the use polythene and other non-decomposable material is prudent, it can be argued. However, it is not clear if the authorities have looked at the practical side of such measures and taken steps to find replacements to fill the blanks. For instance, the highest quantity of polythene is made of the shopping bags, commonly known as silli silli bags issued by the hundreds of thousands by shops, boutiques, and supermarkets to their customers with their purchases. But no alternatives have come to the market even after the announcement of the ban, except for cloth bags promoted by one or two supermarket chains.Hundreds of thousands of people working in offices and other work places would find it difficult to bring their lunch from home when the use of lunch sheets is banned in a few weeks. The hotels and the other eateries would also face the same problem when people order take away food packs. Apparently there do not seem to be any discussions on the alternatives available. The authorities seem to assume that the people would find alternatives once they are pressed to do so. ��Before 1974 when the �silli silli bags� came into the market, people used cloth bags and bags made of other local materials such as the pan malla for shopping and almost everything was wrapped in used newspapers, discarded cement bags and leaves of text books and exercise books discarded by students. There were bags made of �brown paper� and pages from used exercise books. Food was wrapped in banana leaves which were brought to Colombo under very unhygienic conditions. With the concerns and the attitudes of even those in remote areas on hygiene and cleanliness having drastically changed, reverting to many of those materials used some forty years ago seems to be out of question. ��We reiterate that the professed intention of the government is commendable. But it would only be practical if it entails appropriate alternative measures. Otherwise it would face the fate that was faced by the decision taken by the previous government to transport vegetable from farming areas to Colombo in plastic boxes. � ��",dengue
Forgotten professions: Plight of a nation,"2017-07-27 00:04:27							0						 				779","BY Asanga Abeyagoonasekera�I hate victims who respect their executioners��-Jean-Paul SartreThe Sri Lankan public has become the unfortunate victim of the nation�s health and sanitation crisis. The policymakers are questioned by both the public and media of their inability to manage the ongoing situation.�One of the world�s most iconic cities, New York, was turned into a garbage dump in February 1968 due to the sanitation workers� refusal to collect garbage. After nine days, 100,000 tonnes of garbage had piled up and a state of emergency was declared.�In Sri Lanka, garbage collection in Colombo and the surrounding areas has become a serious problem over the past few weeks. Sabotaged by the sanitation workers and relocation of the garbage dump, with an ongoing blame game, has aggravated the situation. A record high of 100,000 dengue patients is an indirect consequence. Hospitals have run out of beds compounding the health crisis.�An increasing number of people do jobs that we can do just fine without and even if they stop work, it would have a minimal impact. This, however, is not the case with garbage collectors. Sanitation of any city is an essential service.�According to the New Economic Foundation, a British think tank, for every pound earned by advertising executives, they destroy an equivalent of seven pounds in the form of pollution, stress, over-consumption and debt; conversely, each pound paid to a trash collector creates an equivalent of 12 pounds in terms of health and sustainability.�While the public sector�s essential services have much hidden benefits to society, it is unfortunately not recognised and compensated enough. The agents of prosperity: teachers, law enforcement officers, nurses and research scholars are paid poorly while unimportant and superfluous jobs are paid well. Rutger Bergman, one of Europe�s prominent young thinkers, describes the situation best as jobs of �shifters�. Instead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift wealth around within the economy.�David Graeber, an anthropologist at the London School of Economics, calls this �Phenomenon for bullshit jobs�. Innumerable people spend their entire life doing these jobs, which pays them well but does not create anything for society. A researcher in Sri Lanka only gets an average salary of US $ 200-US $250 a month while the marketing executive gets 10 times more.�A hefty pay check and a comfortable life, however, do not mean one is producing something of great value. One could revisit Friedrich Engels, who explained in his �false consciousness� to which the proletariat had fallen victim. For example, luxury vehicles imported by politicians with further supplementary budgets was passed a few days ago. It allows for the purchase of a few more vehicles and maintenance of residences, but does not add any value to society. It only increases the debt and public dissatisfaction. The proletariat is misled by a segment of society.�Sri Lanka�s president recently pointed out that �Anyone watching TV feels there is no government in the country� because the development is not reported by the media. The president�s development work tends to get overshadowed by certain public agitation especially due to the multiple political voices of the government, which confuse the polity. The government should focus its energy to resolve and manage the ongoing crisis and strengthen the more productive sectors of the economy.�Sri Lanka will import 200,000 metric tonnes of rice from foreign nations such as Myanmar in July. The country could become self-sufficient and export rice if it properly manages this important area. As an island nation, Sri Lanka imports fish and coconut. Israel is one of the best examples of creating a technological revolution in their agricultural and dairy farming sector. For example, a cow produces four litres of milk a day in Sri Lanka on an average, while the corresponding quantity in Israel is 22 litres.The agents of prosperity: teachers, law enforcement officers, nurses and research scholars are paid poorly while unimportant and superfluous jobs are paid wellAnnually 10.5 tonnes of milk is produced in Israel, much more than the milk production in the US, Australia and Germany. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi�s visit to Israel this month focused on technology transfer between Israel and India. This indicates a correct strategic direction taken by him.�Israel�s research and development expenditure is 4 percent of its gross domestic product, a high amount giving it the desired results. Certain countries, however, are uninterested in innovation and research and all they focus is on quantity, profit and short-term election goals.�The way things are in Sri Lanka right now should change; its political culture, economy and universities can all be reinvented to generate real innovation and creativity. It is not necessary to wait patiently for a cultural change.�The Sri Lankan government should introduce dramatic changes to all sectors taking even from small nations such as Bhutan that have introduced laws for parliament candidates to have a formal degree. First and foremost, the policymakers should be in a position to understand the priorities and recognise the necessities of society.�(The views expressed here are personal and do not reflect those of the Government of Sri Lanka or Institute of National Security Studies (INSS).

Strays Snarl as Authorities Turn Predators!,"2017-07-26 01:32:55							4						 				1680","��All living beings fear being beaten with clubs, fear being put to death. ��Putting oneself in the place of the other, Let no one neither kill nor cause another to kill,� ��-Dhammapada verse no. 129 ��In the recent past, with media�s exposure of increasing disappearances of stray animals�, their brutal capture and the absence of transparency in removing dogs from public places, has given rise to speculation that these animals were killed. ���Especially during the events at the 11th International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Awards ceremony in 2010 and the 23rd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 2013 held in Colombo, the special operation was carried out to remove stray animals from streets as a beautification measure launched by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). In the most recent attempt to remove stray cats and dogs from the Moratuwa University, a fatal accident happened where animals were overdosed by �Ketamine� that brought them unfortunate deaths. Daily Mirror explored the subject of killing animals after the public and Animal Rights Activists poured outrage after a shocking video went viral recently in social media. The video showed the alleged cruelty to animals that took place within the premises of the University of Moratuwa. ���History ��In recorded history, ancient Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) was the first-ever country to practice an animal-friendly culture. After all, Mihintale was proclaimed as the world�s very first wildlife sanctuary. This came as a result of the efforts of Arahath Mihindu Thera in guiding King Devanampiya Tissa. As a result, animal sacrifice wasn�t permitted and the practice spanned at least two millennia under many Buddhist kings. ��According to Mahavamsa, the history of strays dates back to the beginning of time, the Sinhalese civilization. �Kuweni� sent a stray dog to guide Vijaya -- an Aryan Prince who was expelled from India for his notorious acts -- to the village from the shores. He later became her husband. ��Religious and regional mythologies � Dogs and Cats were Gods, worshiped by the people Dogs and cats are mankind�s first and most common domestic animals and have played a sacred role in many religious traditions. The dog is one of the 12 animals honored in Chinese astrology. The second day of the Chinese New Year is considered to be the birthday of all dogs. ���Later in 2016 and in the beginning of 2017, State Universities were concerned about removing strays from their premises. They charged that the medical units of the universities had records of many dog bite incidents. The university authorities didn�t hesitate to remove many domesticated cats and dogs�Christianity ��A dog is mentioned in the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit, faithfully accompanying Tobias, Tobit�s son and the angel Raphael on their journeys. ��The Catholic Church recognizes Saint Roch (also called Saint Rocco), who lived in the early 14th century in France, as the patron saint of dogs. The feast day of Saint Roch, August 16, is celebrated in Bolivia as the �birthday of all dogs�. ��A black and white dog is sometimes used as an informal symbol of the Dominican order of friars, religious sisters and nuns. Domini canes in Latin means �the dogs/hounds of the Lord.� ����Egyptian mythology ��The Ancient Egyptians are often more associated with cats in the form of Bastet, yet here too, dogs are found to have a sacred role and figure as an important symbol in religious iconography. Dogs were associated with Anubis, the jackal headed god of the underworld. ����Greek mythology ��Dogs were closely associated with Hecate in the Classical world. Dogs were sacred to Artemis and Ares. Cerberus was the three-faced guard dog of the underworld. ����Hinduism ��The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day Tihar festival that falls roughly in November every year. The dog (Shvan) is also the vahana or mount of the Hindu god Bhairava. Yudhishthira had approached heaven with his dog. Therefore among many Hindus, the common belief exists that caring for or adopting dogs can also pave way to heaven. ���Islam ��There are a number of traditions concerning Muhammad�s attitude towards dogs. He said that the company of dogs, except as helpers in hunting, herding, and home protection, voided a portion of a Muslim�s good deeds. On the other hand, he advocated kindness to dogs and other animals. Abu Huraira narrated that the prophet said: ���While a man was walking he felt thirsty and went down a well, and drank water from it. On returning, he saw a dog panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, �This (dog) is suffering from the same problem as that of mine.� So, he (went down to the well), filled his shoe with water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked him for his (good) deed and forgave him. The people asked ``O Allah�s Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals? He replied: ``Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being)�. ���Today ��Even though the animals were sacred and worshiped by our ancestors throughout history, people gradually lost interest in them and gave priority to urban development. In this new endeavor they saw animals as a threat to the beauty of the nature. Dogs were identified as the cause for Rabies, hence the destroying of a large number of stray dogs. ��Sri Lanka as a country, where the majority Buddhist community practices non-violence, hasn�t paid enough concern for the welfare of animals, especially those categorized as stray. ��Cruelty to animals has forced Animal Rights Activists to work towards imposing a more efficient and down to earth mechanism using legal help. ��Despite this country�s Buddhists practicing a non violence, and it being given a foremost place not only from its Constitution, but also in the hearts of the majority of people, it�s questionable why a sudden spate of incidents regarding animal cruelty are reported across the country. Is there a real need to remove these animals from people�s backyard or is it the mind set of the government? ��From the perspective of the authorities, who removed stray animals, rabies had spread among the urban community at a considerable pace. In 2016, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha put the figure regarding stray dogs in Sri Lanka to 50,000 and said they were a public nuisance. ��Minister Musthapha appointed a committee to make a national policy, regarding strays, which would become a Bill. But their efforts never reached the Parliament. Animal rights activists claim the Minister pretends to safeguard animal rights, but the Advisory Committee appointed is nothing more than a white elephant. The minister had stated last year that and if dogs were released in public places, action will be taken against their owners. ��Rabies was back in the news in January 2012 during the time of then Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena. Animal lovers and animal rights activists raised their concerns when Sirisena announced that Sri Lanka had decided to lift a moratorium on the killing of stray dogs. This came in the wake of the government struggling to tackle the problem of 2,000 people being admitted daily to hospital after being bitten by dogs. ��Later in 2016 and in the beginning of 2017, State Universities were concerned about removing strays from their premises. They charged that the medical units of the universities had records of many dog bite incidents. The university authorities didn�t hesitate to remove many domesticated cats and dogs. Starting from the Sri Jayewardenepura University (J�pura) until the final incident- where as many as 23 stray cats and dogs were taken out from the Moratuwa University premises-the removal activities were continued without any guideline from the University Grant commission (UGC) or the Public Health Veterinary Services of Health Ministry. ��Meanwhile the strays reportedly went missing in large numbers prior to many international events held in Colombo. According to CMC sources these efforts were taken to maintain a clean environment.���Govt. hired private pest control institutions ��During many occasions �Ultrakill� Pest Control (Ultrakleen), licensed in Sri Lanka as a pest control service provider (License No: RP/PCS/WP/007) was hired by the CMC. This was to remove the strays from the streets. ��Meanwhile, on 10th April 2017, Divisarana Animal Welfare Society of University of Sri Jayewardenepura exposed an incident where 32 dogs at J�pura went missing. ��The members of the society had complained regarding the incident on11th April to the police who discovered that this company was allegedly involved in a racket. Investigations revealed that the company had been given the tender to remove the strays by J�pura Vice Chancellor (VC), a claim that the latter rejected. ��It is said that the University security- managed by the Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited (RALL)- was involved in removing stray animals from the Moratuwa University premises. The RALL security personnel are said to have removed the strays using Ketamine (an anesthetic drug). The animals were mistakenly given an overdose, leading them to tragic deaths. The VC refuted claims that the university authorities were responsible. �We maintain a dog free environment within the university premises. It is unfortunate that the security officers overdosed the animals when they attempted to sedate them,� the VC told Daily Mirror. ����Legal background ��The law of culling stray dogs was imposed in 1983 and is still effective in keeping with present laws. This allows the killing of stray animals to to keep a check on rabies. At a time when the rest of the world is concerned over stray animals, the first ever nation which was able to maintain a wildlife sanctuary for centuries has started moving towards digging a mass grave for strays. It�s a shame how the law operates to maintain a stray-free Colombo. ����SRI LANKA�S LAWS ON ANIMAL CRUELTY, DOG POPULATION CONTROL AND RABIES ERADICATION-�Lalani Perera, Lawyer and Animal Rights Activist ��Animal cruelty and rabies control in Sri Lanka are still governed by archaic laws enacted over a century ago. They reflect on the thinking of that era that animals are chattel. The punishment for cruelty will slap one with a fine of a mere100 rupees. The government took a decision in to enforce a �No Kill Policy�. This paved the way for strays to be vaccinated and sterilized. However, still, the media continues to highlight the increase in the brutal capture and the disappearance of dogs and the absence of transparency regarding these activities. While many countries are affording statutory recognition to animals as sentient beings or �non human persons� with a right to life, our policy makers, are yet to reach that level of enlightened thinking. �An Animal Welfare Bill proposed by the Law Commission back in 2006, to replace the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance of 1907, is yet to become law. This is because groups with vested interests have continuously impeded its enactment. Issues that arose regarding strays have been resolved at the highest level and involved the Attorney General�s Department, the former Presidential Secretary and the Rural Economic Affairs Ministry Secretary (the Ministry responsible for the Bill). ���The government took a decision in to enforce a �No Kill Policy����I am against cruelty to animals�- Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Musthapha �As for the Rabies Ordinance of 1893 and the Dog Registration Ordinance of 1901, a group of activists have, through a court case, recommended to the local government authorities to amend these laws to provide statutory recognition to the �No Kill� Policy and repeal all provision that allows killing. The Animal Welfare Advisory Committee of Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha, too has, at the Minister�s request, submitted a draft law to address the matter. This has been done using the globally acknowledged humane method called CNVR (Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release). ��The government must give priority to get these laws enacted without further delay. Animal lovers hope that President Sirisena will intervene to ensure that that compassion will be shown to animals with whom we share this land. ���I�m against animal cruelty. I have other national priorities too. But killing animals isn�t the solution for rabies,� Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Musthapha said. ���The government must give priority to get these laws enacted without further delay. Animal lovers hope that President Sirisena will intervene to ensure that that compassion will be shown to animals with whom we share this land��I�m personally against any kind of animal cruelty. It�s unfortunate that the incident took place at the Moratuwa University. However, I�m not wishing to comment on it as it is the Vice Chancellor�s duty. Social media claims that I�m behind this animal slaughter which is false. From the beginning I intervened to offer a better solution to the issue. Animal shelters were to be built according the plan, but these efforts were halted because the animal rights activists showed displeasure. ���Most of the Animal Rights Activists expect us to let stray animals roam freely on the roads. There were dogs under the beds of the Cancer Hospital. We found dogs in religious places and public markets causing nuisance to the public. The public accuse us of not removing these animals from the streets fearing the spread of rabies and other diseases. Animals should be removed from the streets and provided with shelter,� Musthapha said. ��Musthapha added that the social media was slinging mud, but warned they couldn�t stop what he was doing. I�m compassionate towards animals. Some classy people are claiming that I�m involved with the killing of animals. The CMC and other municipalities don�t come under my purview. The direct authority lies with the Chief Minister (CM) of the particular province. The Local Government Ministry only has a coordinating responsibility according to the 13th Constitutional amendment. I have decided as a citizen of the country that I too should play my role to put an end to animal cruelty. ��Last year I formed an Advisory Committee following many requests made by Animal Rights Activists. It was our main goal to pass the Animal Welfare Bill. During the past two and half months I couldn�t attend to the matter effectively as floods, dengue and garbage became national issues. Those were under my direct authority and I had to commit my time to them. However, I give assurance that I will not delay this issue further. Though I have no authority on the subject, I will coordinate with the relevant CMs and table the Animal Welfare Bill in Parliament soon. �����Dogs and cats were a part of our university life��- Hassini Silva, Young Animal Rights Activist ��I am one of the main persons who has voluntarily undertaken the responsibility regarding the welfare of the dogs at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura since 2010. It�s from this university that I graduated with the degree �Bachelor of Science in Business Administration� (Special) in 2015.� �In that capacity I have taken part in re-homing closer to 120 puppies and adult dogs born and bred in the university premises and the surrounding area. I have taken steps to feed them frequently, especially during the Avurudu and Christmas vacation when food is scarce. ��Up to now there�s no information regarding the missing dogs. These dogs were our friends during the time we studied there. We loved and cared for them even after leaving the university. We spent our scarce funds to ensure their health and safety. They were more like companions than animals to most of the students and the staff of the university. There were a few puppies who had just recovered from distemper attacks. One already had a new home and was waiting for transport to be sorted out. One dog provided security to the students (especially the girls) during the times we walked around the university at night. There was even one dog who led protests with the boys. ��They were a part of our university life, giving us fond memories. Therefore in the name of justice for our lost friends who were cruelly taken away, and for the sake of future undergraduates I sincerely hope this act of cruelty doesn�t set a bad example. This prestigious institute is supposed to inculcate virtues in the minds of the young. �����A group of people complain that the govt is behind killing of strays�� Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka ��When the government attempts to resolve the current issues gradually, some people are making baseless accusations that the Unity Government is killing strays. They claim that during the past regime dogs were slaughtered in large numbers, especially at the time when the IIFA function held in Colombo. I assure that we never did anything like that. Why don�t the ones who have claim to have a passion for animals and speak for their rights come forward and save the lives of the poor strays who are consuming polythene on the streets? Don�t pretend to be Animal Rights Activists on Facebook or on other social media. I kindly request these people to come forward and offer a helping hand in the operation carried out by the local government bodies to ensure the safety of these animals. � Strays snarl as authorities turn predators!�Accidents involving animals claim the lives of a large number of motorcyclists annually����Rs. 200 million allocated per annum to eradicate rabies��- Public Health Veterinary services (PHVS) Director Ruwani PimburageRabies is 100% fatal. But it�s also 100% preventable, both in human and animal populations. The only preventive measure is to remove the rabies virus from the dog community and minimize its spreading. ��Around 600 strays are affected with the rabies virus yearly. To safeguard the people the government has carried out many initiatives.�The PHVS control the stray population using birth control procedures. We are conducting over 150,000 sterilization surgeries per year. Usually a female dog breeds twice a year and has a total litter of at least six puppies. Therefore we control a dog population which is around 900,000. They have been controlled by the PHVS since 2008. ��However, we never kill a stray dog unless it�s infected with rabies. Our policy is to sterilize stray animals to control the population, not to kill them. But CMC has powers to remove animals from the streets under the public disturbance law. It�s the local government bodies that have killed animals since1976. ���Ketamine�, a chemical used as an anesthetic, causes paralysis in animals. This anesthetic is mostly used across the world. Veterinary surgeons (Vet. surgeon) are the only authorised personnel to carry the drug and use it. Even Vet. Surgeons run a risk when administering the drug and might give an overdose to strays because they don�t do clinical tests regarding the animals. However regarding the Moratuwa university incident, if the drug was used by non-Vet. Surgeons, an investigation should be carried out. Unfortunately we don�t have the authority to take prompt action regarding such incidents. In 2016, 21 deaths were reported in connection with rabies. Ten of those deaths were reported during the first half of this year. If humans or animals are affected by the virus, there�s no other solution except destroying them. Any way, the affected will have a natural death after 10 days. The most important fact is to prevent it from spreading. It�s the PHVS� duty and we never kill an innocent stray.���Stray dogs are a big issue to motorcyclists�- Ceylon Motorcyclist Association Secretary Chirantha Amerasinghe, �The issue of stray dogs is indeed a big issue to motorcyclists. However, from our perspective, the issue isn�t limited to dogs, but to animals such as cows as well. Cows are black and night creatures. They possess a coat that absorbs light, so unlike dogs, remain invisible at night. These animals sleep on the road and cross the road without any regard, often being in panic mode. Accidents involving animals claim the lives of a large number of motorcyclists annually. There are instances when dogs and cows attack motorcyclists and have caused major loss of life and also caused injury. We however condemn the killing of animals and don�t approve such methods as the solution. We believe that by installing illuminated collars on such animals many accidents could be avoided. ���The only preventive measure is to remove the rabies virus from the dog community and minimize its spreading�",dengue

SL�s tourism industry  feels the sting,"2017-07-25 00:16:54							0						 				2328","The prevailing situation regarding dengue in Sri Lanka will definitely have an effect on Sri Lanka�s tourism industry. The island attracts visitors from other countries by virtue of its biodiversity and strategic location. When examining the impact on the tourism industry, Director of Public Relations at the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Dushan Wickramasuriya, revealed that there is some sort of an indirect impact on the Sri Lanka tourism industry due the present dengue epidemic. He said that as a result there has been a considerable decline in the arrival of foreigners since May. The Monthly Statistical Bulletins, which offer information regarding tourist arrivals and hotel occupancy, provides the following information for the period between January to June 2017The data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) reveals that Sri Lanka�s tourist arrivals declined in March by 2.5 percent compared to the same period last year. Wickramasuriya further stressed that the reason for the decline in the arrival of foreigners doesn�t only depend on dengue alone, but it has been one of the core grounds for the drop in the number. ��Tourism Minister, John Amaratunga told Daily Mirror that the country hadn�t been able to record the expected tourist arrivals during the month of June mainly due to the floods, dengue outbreak and the garbage crisis. ��""If you �need emergency medical�assistance�during your trip,�dial 011 2691111�and ask for an ambulance""���The dengue epidemic itself didn�t adversely affect the tourism arrivals this month. When the flood situation was on the surface, there was a considerable decline in the arrival of foreigners. But now the floods are over. Even dengue is now on the decline, so we are confident that tourist arrivals will receive a boost and we will be able to achieve our targets,� Amaratunga said. �He added that tourist arrivals established a record last year with the figure reaching 2 million. The authorities are expecting an additional 2.5 million tourists to arrive this year. �The United Kingdom High Commission declared that the UK Government has issued a health advisory to visitors from the UK ensuring that their people are secure from the prevailing condition of dengue. This kind of travel advisory indicates that dengue in Sri Lanka is pathetic. The travel advisory is as follows as: All regions of Sri Lanka experience outbreaks of the mosquito-borne dengue fever.�Tourism Minister, John Amaratunga told dailymirror that the country hadn�t been able to record the expected tourist arrivals during the month of June mainly due to the floods, dengue outbreak and the garbage crisis�103,114 suspected cases of dengue fever have been reported between January and July 2017 compared to 55,150 cases reported for the year 2016.

But with regard to tourism, the prevailing circumstances pertaining to dengue haven�t yet cased any damage or loss to the tourism industry in SL,� he said. �He revealed that although there is a general tendency to see a drop in �foreigners this season, he didn�t see dengue to be the reason behind this. He nevertheless said that this situation will change by September and more foreigners will be arriving in Sri Lanka. �When contacted, Hoteliers Association President Sanath Ukwatta, said that there has been a substantial decline in the arrival of foreigners in connection with some of recognized hotels in Sri Lanka like Gall Face Hotel, Mount Lavinia Hotel and Cinnamon Grand Hotel.

Negombo Worst hit tourist city!,"2017-07-25 00:10:42							3						 				9386","It�s visible that the city worst hit by dengue in the country is Negombo. Director General Health Services of Western Province Dr. Ahemed Fareed told Daily Mirror �that plans have already been carried out by the health authority to initiate new programs and control the spread of dengue in the Western Province, especially in Negombo.�Dr. Fareed said that the health authority has deployed 50 labourers to Negombo and 40 to Colombo to clean up drains and assist hospital staff. At the same time, we have established new dengue control units in the Western Province. ����At the same time, unless we get used to dumping dirt at appropriate places, we might not care much about dumping garbage at allocated places� � �Dr. Ahemed Fareed � ����The current situation is pathetic�- Dr. Ahemed Fareed ��Most number of cases has been reported in May and June due to the inclement weather condition experienced from April till the end of May. It�s clear that rain has been one of the core reasons for the rapid prevalence of the dengue infection. Apart from the consequences of rain, the garbage issue also has made a massive impact on the spread of dengue. When the garbage disposal process isn�t carried out properly, the larvae of dengue can survive with ease. It�s we who set the background for the mosquitoes to greed their grounds as we lack concern regarding the disposal and segregating of muck collected in our houses. At the same time, unless we get used to dumping dirt at appropriate places, we might not care much about dumping garbage at allocated places. If you don�t pay attention to this matter, you will have to face the consequences. Therefore, it�s really essential to be mindful and take precautions, so that the prevailing situation of dengue doesn�t worsen,� he added. ��The current situation of dengue is indeed pathetic, when we examine the latest updates regarding patients. The Epidemiology Unit told Daily Mirror that there have been 103,114suspected dengue cases reported since 2017 from all over the country. Out of this figure 275 deaths have been reported so far. Approximately 43.67% of dengue cases were reported from the Western Province. ��The Western Province has recorded 45,030 cases so far this year, the most number of cases when considering all provinces. Consultant community physician at the National Dengue Control Unit, Dr Preshila Samaraweera told Daily Mirror that the main reasons for this are the huge piles of garbage which have been rotting for weeks along with drains not being cleaned. ���Colombo statistics bloated unnecessarily ��A number of hospitals are loaded with dengue patients, especially the Negombo Base Hospital because the area is now under the spotlight for dengue. Although a substantial number of cases has been reported from Colombo, Negombo is deemed to be the city most severely affected by dengue. The reason for this is because when most of the people from rural areas come to Colombo to take treatment for dengue, these statistics are added to the list of patients in Colombo. That�s why the number of dengue cases is considerably high in Colombo,� she said. �With the rapid increase of dengue patients, we will be granted two temporary additional wards which are being built for the in-house dengue patients� Dr Preshila Samaraweera ���Meanwhile, there has been congestion in some hospitals especially in the Negombo Base Hospital. This is due to the inadequacy of beds in relation to the number of in-house patients at the hospital, the Director of Negombo Base Hospital Nilanthi Pathirana told Daily Mirror.�There are nearly 4,500 patients and 12 deaths have been reported so far from the Negombo Hospital. Although, there are nearly 800 dengue in- house patients now in the Hospital, the beds remaining are only 569. The following information illustrates the number of cases reported since January 2017 in Negombo,� she said. ��""There are nearly�4,500 patients�and�12 deaths�have been reported so far from the Negombo Hospital""Jan -123, Feb - 95, March - 129, April - 218, May � 467, June � 1884 and July-934 �She mentioned that the issue has emerged following the ongoing construction of the main building of the hospital which will be completed soon. She nevertheless stated that the situation seems to be under control as the Out Patient Department (OPD) is sufficiently geared to treat a considerable number of dengue patients. ���With the rapid increase of dengue patients, we will be granted two temporary additional wards which are being built for the in-house dengue patients. This is an initiative of the Army present at the Negombo Hospital premises. When the President paid a sudden visit to the hospital, he had noticed that the institute lacks sufficient facilities to accommodate in- house patients. The President had then instructed the current Chief of Defence Staff and former Commander of the Sri Lankan Army, Crishanthe De Silva to look into the matter and take necessary measures. Even though there is a problem at present for patients to find accommodation, we try our level best to mitigate the inconvenience caused and supply a possible service to the people,� she added. ��Confidential sources revealed that10 doctors and 20 staff members of the Negombo Hospital have been affected by dengue. Besides, this situation depicts the real gravity of dengue in Negombo city. However, when we contacted Dr. Lakkumar Fernando and inquired about this situation, he totally denied these facts. He said that there are only 3 doctors who were affected by dengue. Director General of Health Services of Western Province Dr. Ahemed Fareed also said that a lesser number of doctors and staff members suffer from dengue, both in Negombo as well as other regions. ��The following table denotes the number of patients reported month wise in 2017. ����SL�s tourism industry feels the sting",dengue

Dengue mosquito menace Simple Alternatives HIGHLIGHT,"2017-07-24 00:29:48							0						 				1415","Dengue is now centre stage in the Newspapers, Radio and on TV.However, the whole focus is on prevention � and rightly so But perhaps there are other approaches that have not been presented to the public and perhaps this letter could be used or more effectively in an editorial, to bring it to the notice of the public.But first let us look at the facts.�A week or so ago, it was reported in the Dally Mirror that Government researchers had found that there are now two mosquito types that carry the virus and that the Dengue-causing mosquitoes have also developed a resistance to the chemicals used in fogging and in drains.�It is of course well known, that insects are able to develop resistance to chemical pesticides.�So, if Mosquitoes can develop resistance to chemicals, we too can increase our NATURAL resistance to viral diseases. It is actually quite simple but we need to take action to increase our resistance (like taking action to go jogging for our health).���Action to be taken: (1) Daily eat 5 or 6 leaves of RAW Holy Basil (Thulasi in Tamil, Maduruthala in Sinhala) in Mallums or salads as it is an �adaptogen� a bio-chemical that increases resistance to viral diseases (See attached article � from www.mercola.com) (2) Reduce and if possible eliminate foods that lowers your resistance to disease, such as refined white sugar (basically a chemical like any lab chemical), and therefore uses up vital minerals in order to be digested, lowering disease resistance, bone loss in older people etc.�Use alternatives like Kitul or Coconut jaggery or treacle (pani). �(3) Reduce and if possible eliminate white flour products because they contain �Gluten� which also lowers resistance and even promotes ill health. (4) We all know that many farmers use chemical fertilizers and pesticides and we know from Facebook and you-tube that other local and imported food products too have chemicals.�So choosing Organic foods may be wise even though it may be more expensive.���With regard to the problem of resistance to Fogging Chemicals, a simple natural alternative is to use Neem (Kohomba) oil. This has to be mixed with a little detergent (such as dish-washing liquid) to counteract the �oiliness, so that it could be used as a spray. Unlike chemicals (which have a single chemical that kills), Natural insecticides have an arsenal of different bio-chemicals which is why insects cannot easily develop resistance to them For stagnant water in drains etc. (blocked by people using drains as rubbish dumps) , a simple and inexpensive alternative is to use waste engine oil. The oil forms a film on the surface and mosquito larvae in the Pupal Stage (when they are shaped like a �comma�) are air breathers and come to the surface to breath air. The oil blocks their breathing tube on the top of the �comma� and they die.Note � the harmful chemicals used as additives in Engine oils are �burnt� in waste or used engine oil, so that the remaining oil is say 90 percent similar to the oils extracted from the earth and therefore biodegradable.",dengue

When the authorities suddenly showed up they rushed away as they got scared of the armed Police,� he said.Mr. De Livera also said the baby pool and the play zone were completely destroyed leaving it open to stagnant water - an ideal place for dengue mosquitoes to breed.�No notice was given, they have timed it perfectly. Crashing in on a Friday afternoon they knew we would be unable to go to Court to get an injunction,� he said.Meanwhile, the members of the club questioned the motive behind the project to start from the CSC leaving out the premises of the American Embassy and other commercial sites.However, RDA sources said that the Court Order to take over the land was issued on July 7 and it included most of the pool area as well.Club members expressed concern over the way it was handled and said that they feared the CSC�s pride and the existence would be threatened by RDA�s move.The CSC established in 1936 is now seventy five years old.

Don�t strike with all your might,"2017-07-21 01:58:24							0						 				1817","Though we hear and talk a lot about human rights, responsibility ranks among our noblest virtues. Major religions teach and we need to be aware that we are responsible for the welfare and well-being of all people, specially the oppressed people enslaved in the poverty trap. Beyond that, in this modern era, we are also responsible for all creatures�ranging from elephants to ants. We are responsible for the oceans and rivers, trees and plants, the air and the delicate balance in our ecology. ��It is in this perspective that we need to see the moral issues involved when people or groups - expected by society to act with the virtue of responsibility - abuse the new freedom that Sri Lanka now enjoys. They over-emphasise rights and often resort to strikes which cause more suffering to millions of people who are already suffering more than they can bear. ��On Wednesday, Ceylon Electricity Board employees or unions put themselves into a dark pit instead of providing light. The unions had some justification for their protest outside the Mulleriyawa police station, but not for the 12-hour work to rule, work stoppage, strike or whatever it may be called. Thousands of innocent families including infants and schoolchildren were the innocent victims. Electricity supplies were cut from about 11 p.m. on Wednesday till 2 p.m. yesterday. Most children in the area did not go to school while adults also said they could not get even a few hours of sleep and their days� work commitment might be seriously affected. ��The CEB union say two employees had been sent to disconnect the electricity supply of a tyre shop at Angoda. The Union say the CEB men were assaulted by the trader who allegedly has some strong political connection. Later on Wednesday the CEB staff held a protest outside the Mulleriyawa police station demanding that the trader be arrested. The Police officer in charge assured he would take action within 24 hours but the trade unions apparently suffered a blackout in their sense of responsibility and as a result tens of thousands of people suffered for it. During the blackout at Himbutana a fire erupted on a high tension post. Residents said that for more than 90 minutes they called the CEB�s area office but there was no response. Finally the police came in and with the help of area residents, brought the fire under control. Reports say the CEB unions were planning to call a country-wide general strike from yesterday but a sense of responsibility prevailed and it was averted. �Since the era of the industrial revolution, strikes have been recognised as a right of workers. But it has been a last resort specially in essential services such as health and power supply. Tragically during the past few months it is the Government Medical Officers� Association (GMOA) that has been setting a bad example and showing a lack of responsibility by launching wildcat strikes at a time when the country is facing one of its worst dengue epidemics. ��Last Wednesday Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne�who is virtually at war with the GMOA-- presided at a meeting of a new movement of medical doctors. The GMOA, with a membership of about 20,000, often boasts it is one of the most powerful trade unions in Asia but many patients believe it may be one of the most irresponsible if not ruthless while doctors must surely be aware of the fall that comes�with pride. ��Almost daily we see the GMOA protesting or provoking students to protest against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). Last Monday the government took over the controversial Neville Fernando hospital which is attached to SAITM and the President has offered to come more than half way but the GMOA appears to be wanting to cut off its pound of flesh.",dengue

Australia to provide Rs. 116 mn for Dengue control,"2017-07-20 07:10:37							5						 				4675","Visiting Australian Foreign Minister Julia Bishop said the Australian government will assist Sri Lanka in the eradication of Dengue by providing Rs.116 million for a joint research programme with Monash University.The Monash University research team will trial the introduction of a naturally occurring Wolbachia bacteria to the Sri Lankan mosquito populations which will hopefully prevent the dengue virus from being transmitted to humans. The bacteria was said to have the ability to block other mosquito borne diseases such as Zika and Chikungunya.Addressing the media in Colombo last evening Bishop said the use of the bacteria had been successful in several other countries that it has been piloted in including Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam, India and some pacific nations. �We know the virus has taken a heavy toll in Sri Lanka with close to a 100,000 infected and 250 deaths and we are committed to helping Sri Lanka eradicate dengue once and for all,� Bishop said.Speaking of short term measures to eradicate the disease, Bishop said the Australian government would also provide a grant of Rs.58 million to the World Health Organization (WHO) to immediately implement intensive dengue prevention and control measures.Working with Sri Lankan health authorities and other partners, the objective will be to the reduce transmission of dengue and thereby the incidence by more than 50 per cent over a period of 4-6 weeks in high risk districts of the country. Thanking Bishop, on the initiatives by the Australian government, Health Minister Rajitha Senarathna said the Health Ministry had already developed a sustainable dengue prevention campaign which would ensure the fever would not be a health issue by 2020.The Minister concluded that this assistance was welcome and would help in eradicating dengue in the country. �We have exchanged a letter of intent in participating in the programme and will sign the agreement once discussions are concluded,� he said.

Empower the youth to go green,"2017-07-20 00:17:17							0						 				1861","�Last week, the National Unity Government took a bold and effective step to ban the use of plastic and polythene, including the popular silli silli bags which come easily but do not go away easily. However, there are interested parties with vested interests. They are demanding an alternative. �Environment analysts and responsible eco-friendly citizens believe that the plastic lobby is basically anti-Sri Lanka -- somewhat like LTTE terrorists, who wanted to destroy our country and people. The powerful lobby is trying to do it not with guns or bombs, but with slow painful death caused by degenerative diseases brought on when we consume toxic chemicals. �It is now well known that plastics degenerate in the sea into small particles that resemble fish eggs and are thus eaten by some fish varieties. Thus some of the fish varieties we now eat have plastic pieces in them. This is why we are advised to eat small fish, because larger fish would accumulate more plastic and other toxins, such as mercury. Patient-friendly doctors say this may be one of the reasons why most of us are falling sick more often and hospitals are overcrowded, more so because of the dengue epidemic and the garbage crisis. Thankfully the Government is to put these battles on a war footing. ��Plastic chemicals also seep into the soil and are absorbed by vegetables and fruits that we eat, in much the same way the well-known chemical Bisphenol A (BPA) leaks from plastic bottles into our drinking water. BPA is a female hormone mimic, as it is chemically similar to oestrogen, and according to researchers, is the main reason girl children are growing up as early as eight and even six years of age and boy children are having feminizing traits. Imagine a 6-year-old girl having the feelings and urges of a grown woman. What a tragedy. Could these changes also be fuelling the current trend of broken marriages? �What are the alternatives to plastics? There are many responsible and eco-friendly people who use paper bags, such as the �Good Market� at Reid Avenue and the Mount Lavinia Pola. If the people who run a Pola can do it, why not the big supermarkets ? �The other concern is �buth packet� packaging. Here too, the many food vendors at the �Good Market� Saturday fair have shown the way. They sell food wrapped with oil paper in cardboard boxes- simple and eco-friendly. ��We need to be shocked to learn that Sri Lanka is the 5th worst out of 193 countries, in plastic waste. We may be even worse in food waste. This is because in most other countries food is served by portion size, so that waste is minimized. We in Sri Lanka have what may be called a buffet style � which means that there is a lot of food left over because the food preparers do not want to run out of food. �About one million families have just one meal a day while a colossal amount of five-star buffet meals are wasted. No wonder Colombo�s former Mayor some years ago said that the Kirillapone �kunu mole� had to be closed down, because our waste was so wet and required too much fuel. �The solution is simple -- just grind up your food and kitchen waste in a food blender and it will reduce to half a bucketful. Then dig a small hole and bury it. It is super food for earth worms. In apartments people insert a 1-inch plastic pipe into each flower pot or pot growing salad greens and trees like murunga. They pour the grinded liquid food waste into each pipe and cover with a cork. Earth worms will do the rest. �The Government has announced it is getting down modern machinery to recycle plastic waste and produce even clean energy. Organic waste is to be turned into bio-fertilizer. Last Saturday July 15 was the United Nations World Youth Skills Day. The world body in a statement called on governments to educate and mobilize the youth for the battle against climate change. It is the youth who will be most affected in the next generation if the world does not win this battle. ��Thus the Sri Lankan Government also needs to conduct school lessons on climate change issues including the avoidance of waste of electricity or water and the proper disposal of garbage. As Singapore has done, we need to build green schools here and also green buildings, green hotels and other institutions. � ��",dengue

There are many diseases that endanger one�s health with many more new diseases being discovered daily. Some can be cured while others can�t. Some may be fatal while others aren�t. The phrase �health is wealth� stays true to every word in the phrase and many more people have started paying attention and caring for their health than in the past. The public�s interest on medical issues has increased over a period of time. For the people who are eager to maintain healthy lifestyles today, �Mahajana Suwa Dhana� emerged victorious in serving just that purpose. ���Mahajana Suwa Dhana�, a medical exhibition organized at the BMICH, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Ceylon College of Physicians commenced on July 14 and will conclude on July 16. It served the purpose of educating the public on the latest developments in medicine and empowering their audience in health management. Specialists from medical associations and medical faculties from all over the country joined forces to help raise awareness to inquiring minds. The event was graced by the presence of the Minister of health, nutrition and indigenous medicine, Rajitha Senarathna, as the chief guest. �Dr. Dumitha Govindapala, Consultant Physician, commented on the exhibition�s events. �We had more than a 100 stalls. All the medical specialists came together from around 40 colleges which included Medical colleges, NDCU, Blood Donation campaign, Saukyadana, and many others. Our health status has been double burdened with communicable and non communicable diseases. The country spends a lot of money to cure the diseases . Sticking to the statement that �prevention is better than cure�, we hoped that the conduction of this exhibition would help in educating public and raising awareness. There were blood tests conducted free of charge courtesy of the Ministry�s mobile Laboratory services. There was a stall organized by the Ceylon College of Internal Medicine where free consultations were offered to the public among other programs we conducted.� �The public was open to panel discussions conducted by consultant physicians of common health conditions such as diabetes, heart attacks, asthma, dengue and high blood pressure where the public very keenly got involved, getting their doubts clarified. The highlight of the exhibition was the very many health educational stalls exceeding 100 in number through which presentations were conducted to raise awareness on common medical conditions, screening, diagnosis, treatments and preventive methods. ��There were many medical areas for one to explore which included a high tech zone which allowed the audience to have a glimpse at the future of medicine with holograms and virtual 3D imaging in amazement. The importance of physical fitness and exercises was discussed at stalls in the sports area which got the crowds to actively participate in exercises. The current epidemic, dengue, earned itself a special stall where the do�s and don�ts of dengue were stressed. There were stalls on toxicology held in hope of educating all nature daredevils on poisonous plants and snakes. For those who love a good thrill and all things criminal and mysterious, a forensic section was available. The same can be said about the inquisitive and curious, as they were satisfied with the stalls themed on anatomical mysteries of the human body. Stalls were also held in connection with subjects like sexual health, alcohol and smoking issues and rehabilitation. The healthy lifestyle zone as the name implied, helped educate the public on how to get the best of life. The public also basked in the opportunities of free health check-ups such as blood tests, blood pressure checks, blood sugar checks, cholesterol checks and last, but not least hearing and vision. ���A stroll through the stallsThe Sri Lankan Heart Association, at their stall were focusing on the importance of recognizing heart attacks and seeking immediate help. Dr. M. R. Mubarak, Consultant Cardiologist and the president of the SLHA said that most people ignore the symptoms of a heart attack mistaking them for indigestion, arthritic pains etc. He said that most patients arrive at the hospital when the situation is critical. He said that early admission is a major factor that improves the outcome of a heart attack. Patients having a heart attack usually present with chest pain and tightness on the central and left side of the chest, arm pain, pain in the neck lower chest or upper abdominal area, shortness of breath, excessive sweating, nausea and vomitting. It is advisable for them to seek immediate medical care if a person is having one or more of these signs. �Geriatrics is a relatively new field of specialty in Sri Lanka, focusing on the medical issues that come with old age. Their theme for this year was, �for a dignified Silver age�, meaning that getting old doesn�t mean that you have to depend on others and be less active than you used to be. The stall offered information about issues like Dementia and osteoporosis which are common problems with older citizens. �The stall of the College of Pulmonologists�Sri Lankan Eye Donation Society had a stall where they explained the importance of donating eyes posthumus. Your age or poor vision doesn�t matter in donating your eye tissues, which will be processed by the eye bank and will be donated for free to a person who will continue to see the world through your eyes, long after you�ve departed. You can get more details on donating your eyes and body tissues by contacting National Eye Donation Society at 011-2692051. �Sri Lankan College of Pulmonologists had demonstrated the latest advancements in the field of pulmonology, including Endobronchial Ultrasound Scan and Fiber Optic Bronchoscopy. In addition to providing details about the commonest respiratory diseases like Asthma and COPD, they highlighted the importance of a condition called �Obstructive Sleep Apnoea� which can be present in people who are snoring. This condition should be taken very seriously because it has very damaging repercussions. It has been proven that people with this condition are more prone to get depression and have a higher chance of getting into accidents in addition to other complications. So if you snore heavily in your sleep and feel tired soon after waking up, Dr Bodhika Samarasinghe, Consultant Pulmunologist at the Jaffna hospital advises to consult your family physician immediately. �In addition to the stalls by the specialist Colleges, and Societies in the field of Medicine, Some of the Medical Faculties also had participated in the event. The stall conducted by the Medical Education Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya was focused on the use of Modern technology in Medical Education. The stall was a perfect example of how the traditional could be incorporated with modern technology to give an optimum earning experience to the student. The stall had supplied the audience with an interactive experience, where they got to experience first hand the technologies like virtual reality. Dr. Madhawa Chandrathilake, Head of the Department of Medical Education, speaking about the contents in the stall said that even though these technologies are rarely used in teaching these days, this will be the future of medical education. �Models of kidneys �and nephrons�Among the stalls were the ones conducted by the Ceylon College of Anaesthesiologists, where practical demonstrations on first aid methods like Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation were available to the public. They were able to garner knowledge on what should be done on various emergency situations like choking and cardiac arrest. Another stall on Critical Care Medicine demonstrated an ICU setting, where a patient with serious conditions at risk of losing organ functions are treated with each organ supported by an outside machine, and how they are gradually weaned off the machine when they are getting better. �Sri Lanka Medical Nutritionist�s Association demonstrated the ideal diet for a healthy Sri Lankan, where only half of the plate should consist of rice. Two thirds of the remaining part should consist of vegetables while the other one third should contain proteins. The high risk Sri Lankan citizen faces the danger of suffering non communicable diseases like Diabetes due to their incorrect food habits.In the overall, the exhibition provided a deep insight and a thorough exposure to the various intricasies linked with modern medicine. � �Pics by: Kushan Pathiraja�",dengue

The Siddhalepa Group�s target is to reach more than 1000 schools within this dengue high epidemic period.�The program includes a 15 minute video that is played to schoolchildren at group gatherings or school assemblies to inform students of how to manage their illness in the unfortunate event that they fall victim to dengue.As the medical profession and other dengue awareness educators have discovered, the key danger and the main cause of fatality in dengue patients is the lack of knowledge about how to care for dengue patients during the illness and in the post�recovery stage. �The 15 minute video documentary under the directions and guidance of the National Dengue Control Unit and Institute of Infectious Diseases gives a comprehensive understanding to schoolchildren on managing the dengue patient in the crucial period when the dengue symptoms develop and to the final recovery and post recovery stages. ��At a ceremony to inaugurate the awareness program Siddhalepa Group Managing Director Asoka Hettigoda presented a copy of the DVD of the program to Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. Siddhalepa Group Chairman Dr. Victor Hettigoda recently released the video to the social media. The 15 minute documentary can now be watched on Dialog TV as well.A poster campaign backs up the 15 minute video to constantly remind children and adults of the dangers of the environment they live in and how to prevent and protect them from�the disease.The project is another initiative by the Siddhalepa Group in its Corporate Social Responsibility campaigns which focus heavily on environment and youth.�",dengue
Sri Lanka�s largest Saline Wetland in danger!,"2017-07-19 00:05:45							0						 				1674","Meethotamulla Shifted to Muthurajawela - What after July 20 ?The Supreme Court suspended the dumping of garbage at Muthurajawela following an interim order issued on July 5. The interim order is valid till July 20. This order was issued following a fundamental rights petition filed by a group of concerned villagers on June 14. Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), CMC Commissioner, Urban Development Authority (UDA), Central Environmental Authority (CEA), Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha, Commissioner General of Department of Agrarian Development, Director General of Department of Wildlife Conservation, Director General of Irrigation Department, Assistant Divisional Secretary, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau and the Attorney General were cited as respondents.The Supreme Court bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Upali Abeyratne issued the interim order on the Colombo Municipality which was supported by Dr. Sunil Cooray together with Keith De Mel.Attempts made by a team of journalists from the Daily Mirror to enter the garbage dumping site were foiled at three guarded entryways. However the villagers had already warned us in advance that the unofficial guards present wouldn�t let us in. Somehow, we were led to the nearby office, just to be ignored by an official from CMC. This official spoke in a strict manner and said that they were advised not to allow anyone in without CMC�s permission. We somehow managed to take a few snaps secretively. While we were observing the garbage dumping site, more than 10 lorries arrived with garbage. The villagers were concerned about the pressing they do with garbage.�""The school has been affected so much by the prevailing rotten smell that it is reported that some students had fainted. But nobody had been brave enough to comment on the injustice caused to them""�The garbage is pressed, but no mound is made and the dirt is then invisible to the unsuspecting eye. Even though the CMC had asserted that they are dumping only decaying materials to the yard at Muthurajawela, the villagers maintained that there�s no such separation of garbage when its released into the garbage dump at Kerawalapitiya. Garbage was dumped in places like Delathura, Kerawalapitiya and Pamunugama before the ban was enforced. Now Kerawalapitiya is the only site that permits the dumping of garbage.Negombo Road, Wattala, Mahabage, Nagoda and Kandana areas were polluted with the odor of garbage. A school adjacent to one of these garbage dumps is Nagoda Maha Vidyalaya. The school has been affected so much by the prevailing rotten smell that it is reported that some students had fainted. But nobody had been brave enough to comment on the injustice caused to them.The Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, had issued a statement critisizing garbage dumping in to Muthurajawela, citing that dangerous clinical waste was mixed with other garbage. Fr. Ananda Vithana from the Bopitiya Church also filed a petition.A reliable source told the Daily Mirror that certain environmental service units of reputed companies are collecting garbage from around Colombo and are carrying on the dumping of garbage to Muthurajawela from midnight till morning. The villagers were unaware of the secret disposal of garbage taking place at midnight.Our team spoke to villagers of Kudagaspitiya. This village is plagued by flies after garbage dumping started in Kerawalapitiya.� ���We can�t stand others dumping garbage in our village�- Dilini Kanchana, a shop owner from Kudagaspitiya�We are facing grave dangers with a polluted environment around us. Swarms of flies are invading our shop, hence protecting food from flies is such a burden. The drivers and construction workers here used to have food from our shop, but now there�s a sudden drop in our clientele after the rains that triggered the fly menace.No food can be kept outside because it attracts flies within seconds. Little ones are frequently getting sick. Even if we are able to shoo away flies, little ones can�t and they are always falling sick. The unbearable odor drifts in with the wind and this problem has gathered momentum after the heavy rains. We experienced floods this year and the flood waters took a long time to recede.This is because the drains were affected by the filling of garbage at Muthurajawela. We can�t stand others dumping garbage in our village.���All of Colombo�s garbage is here�- H. Malkanthi�We have been living in a hell for the past two weeks. The garbage dump stinks and flies are intolerable. My three grandchildren are always suffering from fever, indigestion and vomiting. Doctors are advising us to keep them away from flies, but how in the world canwe do that?� An year ago, an attempt was made to dump garbage from the Wattala Municipal Council here. The villagers objected fiercely with support coming from local politician Jagath Jayathunga. Now they are dumping all of Colombo�s garbage here.���After the change of government the dumping started��- D.N.P Gayashan�Nearly 40 or 50 lorries arrive to dump garbage here. This happens from around 8 in the morning till 5.30 pm. The Municipal Council�s lorries and tippers are seen transporting garbage, dripping smelly juices in the process. They say they are filling the land with soil. As a result when there are floods, the water doesn�t drain fast as in the past. Dengue and Filaria are spreading unlike before. There have been attempts to dump garbage here in the past, but those attempts were successfully blocked. Garbage dumping commenced after the change of government.����Releasing harmful chemicals into Muthurajawela kills fish and is a public nuisance.�- Jagath Gunawardena - Environmental lawyer�The EIA report should have been compiled before initiating any waste management project in over one hectare of land, whether the filling happens in wetlands or in a forestland. In Muthurajawela, both rules were broken by not doing an EIA. The Basic Environmental Impact Assessment report should contain the permission of environment officers for the project to be approved. Otherwise legal action can be taken under the 24 B section of National Environment Act.�he clarified.� ��It�s a punishable offense to pollute the water. The release of polluted water in to a wetland spreads it all over and pollutes the wetland. Dead fish is proof that the wetland is already polluted. This is classified as an offense and is mentioned in section 23 H, in National Environment Act. Under the section 27 in Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, releasing harmful chemicals in to any habitat is a punishable offense, if the lives of aquatic species are threatened. Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department should take action for the impact made on fish.Releasing harmful chemicals in to Muthurajawela in a way brings death to fish and has become a public nuisance. The Municipality in the area is the first institution responsible for not taking action regarding this issue because it has the power to throw its weight behind the health of the people in their domain. The others responsible are the PHI and thirdly the police. The municipality is bound to take action against the public nuisance in their area that comes under Urban Council Ordinance or some other relevant ordinance.The Municipal Ordinance specifies that the garbage collected in the municipality should be disposed of in a way, that doesn�t disturb the public. Therefore, the Wattala Municipality, which has allowed other municipalities dump garbage on its domain is at fault.� he noted.� ��The Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources should take action against this. The provincial councils, Wattala Municipality and CMC are responsible. There is a law and order crisis due to the poor attitude of the officials. These institutions have contravened public trust and the responsibilities of public institutions. The public won�t respect the law, when it doesn�t apply in the same way for everyone in the country.� he explained as he highlighted the reasons for the development of this unfortunate situation in the country.��There is a potential threat in the future�- P. Nimal Chandraratne - Director General, National Aquaculture Development Authority in Sri Lanka (NAQDA) ��We aren�t the ones who dump garbage there. There is a potential threat to the resources of fish in said area in the future, if garbage dumping continues long term, like in Meethotamulla. And there are some issues regarding the quality of water. We have sent a group there and compiled a report and informed about the situation to the Mayor.�� �When inquired about the �dead fish found from Muthurjawela in the rainy season� the DG explained, � There is a heavy organic load in the rainy season and it is natural. With the increase of Nitrogen, Pottassium and Phosperous in the water, an algae forms using all the available oxygen in the water, resulting in the deaths of fish. The garbage problem in Muthurajawela will be sorted out soon. As a professional related to this matter, my opinion is that the ornamental fish breeding centres are harbouring fear because the water is being spoiled there, as a result of the garbage problem.� �The DG rejected commenting of the effect on Negombo Lagoon and fisheries there.��Preview of IUCN - Occasional Papers of IUCN Sri Lanka, No. 4, January 2003,- Lucy Emerton and L. D. C. B. Kekulandala�Muthurajawela is the largest saline peat bog in Sri Lanka. Together with the Negombo estuary it forms an integrated coastal wetland ecosystem spanning 6,232 ha. The estimated economic value of the wetland is around Rs 726.5 million per year and the benefits mainly come in the form of flood attenuation and wastewater treatment. The marsh supports livelihood activities such as fishing and to a lesser extent agriculture. The location of Muthurajawela in a rapidly developing and highly populated urban area makes it an extremely valuable, yet vulnerable ecosystem.�According to the findings of Lucy Emerton and L. D. C. B. Kekulandala,The Ecological features in Muthurajawela: The marsh plant community is unstable and represents one of the final stages of succession towards dry land formation. High-levels of human disturbance have led to significant change in the composition of dominant plant species over the last ten years, which in turn had an effect on the faunal composition. The vertebrate fauna includes 40 species of fish (4 endemic and nationally threatened), 14 species of amphibians, 31 species of reptiles, 102 species of birds (including one endemic and 19 winter migrants), and 22 species of mammals. �Out of the 209 species of vertebrate fauna documented, 17 (9%) are endemic, while 26 (12%) are nationally threatened. The endemic fish species include Puntius singala, Esomus thermoicos,Channa orientalis, Clarias brachysoma and Aplocheilus dayi. Among the amphibians, Bufo atukoralei, Lankanectes corrugate, Rana gracilis and Polypedates cruciger are endemic to Sri Lanka.��I cannot take garbage home�- The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner V.K.A Anura�We are issuing separated and decaying garbage in to the compost yard in Muthurajawela. Recyclable cardboard and paper sent to Valaichenai, polythene bags to Dompe and mixed garbage collected from roadside to Kerawalapitiya briefly highlights the present system being operated. Dumping garbage at Kerawalapitiya isn�t banned.� he specified.� �According to the Commissioner, 120 lorries are transporting garbage to the Kerawalapitiya garbage yard daily. He said that garbage dumping at Muthurajawela was started long ago by the �Land Reclamation Corporation�.Responding to a query whether the EIA report had been compiled, he said the Land Reclamation Corporation is dumping garbage there. The Commissioner replied angrily to the question by saying, �Where does the CMC dump garbage after the ban limited the sites available? � in the form of a question and asked, �Can I take the garbage home?�.� ��Garbage is being used as a filling material which is not 100% eco friendly��- Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLR & DC)- Chairman - Asela Iddawela� We are managing 90% of the municipal solid waste from CMC. And the rest from Wattala and Kaduwela municipalities were used to start the project on June 1 this year. We recieved 400 tons of vegetable garbage per day.�� �Replying to the question how they managed the waste after the courts order limited access only to Kerawalapitiya, he said that some part of the portion is sent to a sanitary land filling in Dompe. The garbage is being used as a filling material for the land to be developed, which is not 100% environment friendly alternative, he added.� �Explaining whether they have an EIA report, he said, �We don�t have any EIA report, but we�ve got approval from the Central Environment Authority (CEA).�� �Commenting on the tender notice issued by SLLR & DC to �off shore sand mining and pumping for reclamation and stock piling at Kerawalapitiya and Muthurajawela, under the procurement No/ S/ 183/ 17� he opined that they have received permission from CEA to develop the area. They are going to build a 60 hectare shelter for compost making in Kerawalapititya.���Dissolved garbage enters the canal and affects the whole eco- system�Chaminda Muthukuda� - An information officer at the Muthurajawela Visitor Centre �The garbage dumping sites at Muthurajawela are naturally marshes. Dissolved garbage drips into the canal and affects the whole eco- system. It�s alleged that Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka (DCSL) is releasing unrefined waste water in to Dandugam Oya.The company is allegedly taking cover behind the flood season to continue with their nefarious activities. Schools of fish died due to poisoning. People collected the fish and sold them during the first three days, being unaware of these development. Thus, people have been selling and consuming fish unsuitable for human consumption.This has been allegedly happening regularly, as the above company had been releasing unrefined waste water during a period of four years. It�s easy for them to spare themselves of blame. They won�t accept their fault. Those who play tricks use political influence to dump garbage at Muthurajawela.� he lamented.� ��People assume that piling garbage remotely won�t affect the sanctuary. Yet this area consist of marshes and everything is interconnected. Therefore, existing toxins and toxins that are produced from the garbage seep in to the marsh, creating complicated long term issues.� he said.� ��The public has been invading the sanctuary, filling and building houses. They won�t speak up immediately against the illegal activities here, as they also have filled the marsh and built houses in the area. The filling of land is somewhat under control now, but the biggest problem is the garbage. Sometimes politicians forcibly occupy the land. Some time ago, a brother of former minister Kingsley Perera tried to build a hotel, but with the media spring into action, the situation came under control,� he explained as he spoke of a problem now having deep roots.� ��The Ja - Ela municipality used to dump garbage in the sanctuary. The marsh was filled with garbage and the houses were built on those. The rotten garbage, dripping in the form of juice, dripped into the lagoon and contaminated with Muthurajawela marsh. The water drainage system in Muthurajawela was affected by the highway because they filled every other canal except the major canals. Highways have to be built on piles not disturbing the waterways, like they have done here.Water transportation in and out of marshlands is crucial. Garbage disposal has been happening here for a long time. Even the Ja Ela municipality was dumping garbage here. The affect of garbage doesn�t stop harming the environment or people.� he said filling us with the background to the story.����",dengue
Tamil leadership should shun communal politics - Douglas Devananda,"2017-07-19 00:03:30							2						 				2727","The Leader of Eelam People�s Democratic Party (EPDP) MP Douglas Devananda, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, speaks about the current status of politics in the north and the country as a whole. Excerpts: ��In the wake of political crisis in the Northern Provincial Council, what will be the future of politics there?The Tamil people of this beautiful country always visualised Mother Lanka as a mother with two eyes, namely Tamil and Sinhala languages and with four limbs namely Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. But we were marginalised and humiliated to such an extent since independence by the successive Sri Lankan governments due to their communal and majoritarian politics, we had to wage a struggle to win over our legitimate rights, dignity and self-respect. �Various organisations joined in this struggle and it finally culminated in the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord (of 1987) ushering in 13th Amendment to the Constitution, establishing Provincial Council system, devolving power to the provinces. ��""The ITAK was founded on the platform of Tamil nationalism. They always considered themselves to be the sole representative of Tamil nationalism and branded all those who opposed them as traitors.""�There are different views about the Provincial Council system. How do you see it?Unfortunately the Tamil people of the north-east do not fully enjoy the benefits of this devolution, whereas the rest of the country is fully enjoying it.� �After the Provincial Councils came into operation, the LTTE reneged on it resuming their armed struggle leaving the long suffering Tamil people in the lurch and misery. The Tamil politicians, who assumed power at the Provincial Council elections since 1988, were so incompetent and rudderless. They soon squandered the goodwill of the Tamil people and lost their trust.� �The administrations of the North and East Provincial Councils can only be summed up as lame ducks. No concrete development works have been carried out up to now. All development works initiated by the Central Government have been deliberately stalled such as 65 thousand housing scheme for the homeless and IDPs, Vavuniya Economic Centre, several desalination projects, Iranaimadhu Drinking Water Scheme for Jaffna peninsula and so on. The dengue epidemic is on the upswing and garbage is piling up all over the province but the provincial administration is nowhere to be seen.� �They are incapable of doing anything except lining up their members� pockets. �What do you think of the TNA leadership?The TNA leadership�s idea seems to be to keep the Tamil people in medieval condition without any modern development and in ignorance, so that they can be their political leaders forever.� �They are like the proverbial dog in the manger. This is because the ruling TNA is not competent and not willing to co-operate with the Central Government in implementing the devolution package granted to it in full under 13th Amendment. �Over a thousand Tamil youth paid with their lives to get this Provincial Council system into our statutes. Among these youth nearly half were killed in fratricidal fights. But LTTE first having accepted the peace pact, shortly thereafter renounced it and reverted to their old destructive armed warfare resulting in their debacle and demise causing tens of thousands of civilian deaths and utter destruction to their properties. �Northern Provincial Councillors should not forget and betray the supreme sacrifices made by the Tamil people and their political organisations. They should respect the trust reposed on them by the Tamil electors and should not abuse it. Otherwise they would find themselves in the dustbin of history. When the next election comes the people will teach these politicians a fitting lesson for their betrayal and misconduct. In democracy, the people are the final arbiters of their own destiny. Let�s not forget this cardinal truth. �Northern polity has now been polarised into three camps-namely Tamil nationalists, ultra-Tamil nationalists and pragmatists. Here the nationalist camp consist of ITAK and their associates, the ultra-nationalists consist of All Ceylon Tamil Congress and its cronies, the pragmatists and realists consist of EPDP and its allies. �""Unfortunately the Tamil people of the north-east do not fully enjoy the benefits of this devolution, whereas the rest of the country is fully enjoying it. ""The ITAK was founded on the platform of Tamil nationalism. They always considered themselves to be the sole representative of Tamil nationalism and branded all those who opposed them as traitors. ��They even boasted on their political platforms that Tamil traitors would not have natural death and wished that their political opponents would be liquidated thereby encouraging Tamil youth on the path of terrorism and finally to their annihilation.� �Now, they are being outmaneuvered and outwitted in their own game by the ACTC and its cronies. ITAK instead of enlightening, educating and empowering the Tamil people is leading them again to their doom and hell. �ITAK is choreographing a political tragedy for the long suffering Tami people by their unending political antics and comedy.� �Of course, it�s high time for an alternative political leadership to come to the fore to save the Tamil people from this impending and self-inflicted disaster. That leadership should work on a mission mode with an enlightened vision and indefatigable passion.� �Otherwise, nobody can redeem the Tamils from their present abyss into which they have been pushed by the self-seeking, incompetent and farcical ITAK politicians. �When the next elections are called they can decide their own destiny by exercising their democratic voting rights to elect a decent, dignified and competent political leadership to lead them to prosperity and security. The recent MPCS elections in the North are an eye opener because the people have thrown out corrupt members and have elected new members with impeccable characters.� �Nallur MPCS election is a good illustration for this trend and new phenomenon. Finally people seem to recognise the good people from the bad and the corrupt. It�s a good development indeed. �What is EPDP�s assessment of the political situation in the whole country?The unity government was elected on the promise of good governance. On this score some progress has been made but still a long way to go. The people can now freely protest and express their grievances on the streets without fear and intimidation. But the country is staring at a looming debt trap because of the folly of our politicians. Reserves are dwindling, exports are declining and debt servicing has become unbearable. Only tourism and construction sectors seem to be doing fairly well. �This government came to power on the promise of eradicating corruption but it still remains endemic. This curse of corruption has to be exorcised and banished from the face of our motherland forever if our country is to become prosperous.� �The Unity Government stakeholders should put aside their petty whims and quarrels and stop trying to score brownie points over each other but instead should put their minds together and act in unison to take the country forward towards the prosperity which it rightfully deserves. �The government should embark on a plan of action to double our national income thereby taking our country into the upper middle income country in a decade.� �SAARC should be converted into South Asian Economic Union. ASEAN could also be roped in. A new Bay of Bengal or Bay Economic Union consisting of SAARC and ASEAN could be worked out. All avenues for increasing our trade with our neighbourhood should be explored. In this globalized world protectionism does not offer protection to any country. Trade and export are the sure paths to prosperity and riches. Throughout human history only trading nations had been rich and powerful. �The EPDP was unable to secure enough seats in the North at the last election. What are your plans to revitalize the party?Our party�s performance at the last election was not to our expectation. We were very disappointed indeed. We appointed a high level committee to find out the reasons for this under performance. They have come out with their reasons and remedies for them. One of the major reasons was our party�s tremendous work in serving the people was not adequately highlighted during the election by our candidates and speakers. We were not articulate enough in conveying our achievements to the electorates. �Our grassroots level organisations have been reorganised and invigorated. Grama, Divisional, District, Provincial and National level committees have all been thoroughly reorganized and reprogrammed. All the shortcomings of the last election have been remedied and now we are fighting fit to face any electoral challenges that may come in the future. �""Federal Constitution was first mooted by ...S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike long before the independence as a viable political model for Sri Lanka. Ironically, it was spurned and rejected by the Jaffna Tamil political elites...""�How hopeful are you of a political solution through the current constitution making process?The Unity Government is in the process of drafting a new Constitution. I, myself, am a member of the steering committee of this process. It is hoped, nationally and internationally, that it would provide a political solution to the Tamil national question once and for all.� �This process has big hurdles to cross before becoming operational. Whether it would see the light of the day, nobody knows. But our Prime Minister is doing his upmost to get the new Constitution passed and into operation as soon as possible. If a political solution is achieved through a new constitution it is to be welcomed by all.� �We, on our part, sincerely and earnestly hope and expect for this process to succeed. In this constitution making process the TNA also should play their role very constructively and should not allow any room for misunderstanding between the two major communities. It�s a tight rope walking indeed and I hope and wish that TNA leadership should not mess it up. ��		�Talking in ultra-Tamil nationalistic rhetoric and raking up Tamil nationalistic sentiments have become the easiest ways of staying relevant in northern Tamil politics �			Tamils in North and East do not enjoy power devolved under 13 A �			People in other provinces enjoy it �			All development works initiated by the central government have been deliberately stalled �			65 thousand housing scheme for the homeless and I.D.P.s, Vavuniya Economic Centre, several desalination projects, Iranaimadhu Drinking Water Scheme for Jaffna peninsula are among them �			Dengue cases rising, garbage piling up everywhere, but Provincial Administration not to be seen �			TNA leadership�s idea seems to be to keep Tamil people in medieval condition �			EPDP�s performance at the last election was not to its expectation �			In constitution making, TNA also should play a constructive role very constructively allowing no room for misunderstanding between the two major communities �			�Tamil polity divided into three groups- nationalist camp, ultra nationalist camp and pragmatic camp	How satisfied are you about the progress achieved on the ground in the north under the new government?Under this new Government the democratic rights of the people seem to have been restored to a reasonable level. People seem to protest openly and freely on the streets without fear and intimidation. But no dent had been made on the youth unemployment front leading youth into drugs, crime and other vices.� �The release of lands from the security forces have continued as before in the previous government but still more needs to be done on this problem. On the release of political prisoners and finding a solution to the missing persons issue the movement forward have been stalled. Government should redouble their efforts on these problems and break the impasse. �If the Northern Provincial Council had done its work to the fullest the problems faced by the northerners, such as youth unemployment, land retrieval, garbage disposal and dengue eradication, would have been solved to a great extent. They seem to be incompetent, uninterested and unwilling. Their only interest seems to be enriching themselves. �I sincerely feel if the Unity Government sets its mind on these matters very seriously and earnestly all impediments will be overcome. They should try their best for the sake of the peace achieved at great cost. �Recently, the EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran spoke of a new leadership for Tamils. He hinted that Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran should take over it. What is your view?Talking in ultra-Tamil nationalistic rhetoric and whipping up Tamil nationalistic sentiments have become the easiest ways of staying relevant in northern Tamil politics.� �It has been perfected into a fine-art among the Tamil polity by ITAK and their cohorts. The same phenomenon obtains in the south as well. As the adage says �Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrels�. �Here I would like to say that to be a Sri Lankan we need not lose our Tamil identity, similarly to be a Tamil we need not lose Sri Lankan identity. That is we want to be Sri Lankan and Tamils at the same time. It�s not a tall order. �A new political leadership for the Tamils is needed at this juncture, indeed. It should shun communal politics and wean away the people from it. It should unite the people behind a political program which should be reasonable, realistic and actionable for a just and honorable political solution to the long suffering Tamil people. �""I take this opportunity to call upon the Diaspora to close ranks and unite and not to betray the supreme sacrifices made by our people. ""�The demand for a Federal solution has been there for more than half a century. Yet, it has become unrealistic so far. Do you think it is feasible to achieve a Federal solution in Sri Lanka?A Federal Constitution for Sri Lanka was first mooted by the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike long before the independence as a viable political model for Sri Lanka. Ironically, it was spurned and rejected by the Jaffna Tamil political elites at that time. The country is now paying the price for this folly of rejecting S.W.R.D�s farsighted and enlightened proposal. �Much water has passed under the Kelani Bridge since then. There is not much point in juggling with the terminology at the moment. We should stop splitting hairs over these terms. The science of semantics is not going to lead us anywhere. Substance is more relevant than the wrapping.We can begin with the 13th Amendment which is already in our statutes. The citizens, both in the north and the south are enjoying the fruits of it. Of course, it has its limitations and shortcomings. Let�s first implement the 13th Amendment fully in letter and spirit.� �In the light of the experience gained in working it out and with the trust and harmony among the communities strengthened it can be further improved upon for the betterment of our motherland. �Now let�s start with what we have. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. The proposals which are put forward to find a political solution should be realistic and attainable. I am very confident that a political solution acceptable to the whole country is feasible indeed. �What is your opinion on the role of Tamil Diaspora at the moment?Tamil Diaspora has been at the forefront of the struggle to win over the legitimate rights of the Tamils in Sri Lanka from the beginning. Whether their role has been constructive or destructive has become an unending, animated and emotional debate. Whatever it is, we hope and wish that their future role should be constructive. �Now the civil war is behind us and the door is wide open for a positive role to be played by the Diaspora. They should use their energy and resources to lift the Tamil people out of their present misery and make them rise up from the ashes like the mythological Phoenix. It is high time we prove to the world that we Tamils are a resilient people indeed. �I take this opportunity to call upon the Diaspora to close ranks and unite and not to betray the supreme sacrifices made by our people. They should use all their might at their disposal to peace building and nation building and put our motherland at the forefront of the comity of nations. I sincerely hope the Diaspora rises up to the occasion.�""�No concrete development works have been carried out up to now.

People should change their  �not in my backyard� attitude: Patali,"2017-07-19 00:02:51							1						 				1789","Swamped with the worst garbage crisis in Colombo, President Maithripala Sirisena ordered the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry to find an effective, long-lasting solution at a time when local government authorities are defunct and Dengue epidemic in its deadliest shape. Daily Mirror interviewed subject Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to be acquainted with the ministry�s fresh initiatives to overcome the crisis. Excerpts of the interview:� ""Within the next 30 days, we will set up a hotline to receive people�s complaints over the garbage issue""Disposal of waste has become a grave issue in the country. What is the legal background for waste collection and disposal and who is responsible for them?As per the law, it is the local authorities that are responsible for collecting and disposing waste. These include Pradeshiya Sabhas, the Colombo� Municipality and other municipal councils.President Sirisena gave you six months to resolve the garbage crisis. Do you think the time given is sufficient to make a difference?I have been tasked with handling the waste collected by the CMC, and the process is now underway. There are three obstacles facing the garbage issue. The generation of garbage is increasing due to urbanization. Packaged food and other items are creating a growth in garbage generation compared to the past.The first obstacle we face is the collective social attitude; public protests against all initiatives taken by the government or local authorities. For instance, in 1996, when the then Colombo Mayor Karu Jayasuriya attempted to have a sanitary land in Meepe with the help of the then Urban Development Minister Indika Gunawardena and the World Bank, public protests led by the SLFP, JVP and particularly MP Dinesh Gunawardena stopped this initiative and as a result, Jayasuriya lost the Provincial Council election held three years later.		Three incineration plants soon			Community centres to lead garbage collection and segregation			Court cannot overrule President�s decision			People� should be more supportive	As the previous Environment Minister, I tried to put up a sanitary landfill, a chlorinated one, in Padukka for garbage collected in Colombo. However, most of the councillors and other politicos protested against the move. It was only after we held an awareness campaign on this subject that they agreed to the undertaking. Finally, the then Urban Development Minister Dinesh Gunawardena gazetted the said compound as an area belonging to the Urban Development Authority, thereby bringing the entire process to a standstill.Later, we found another place in Dompe, but it is only a sanitary landfill we have in operation now. If we were allowed to continue our work in Meepe in 2008, there would be no Meethotamulla, Bloemandhal, or any other garbage dumping site. The second concern is the legal aspect. The problem is that although the Local Government Authority Act empowers local authorities, there are times when they have failed even to handle their own garbage. The CMC is an example of this. Although the total population in Colombo stands at 650,000, nearly one million people commute the city, thus mounting the garbage collection to a whopping 700 metric tons, twice of what is generated by the residents of Colombo.Hence, the CMC is unable to handle the situation. This is where Provincial Councils come in. As there are no elected local government representatives, they now come under the purview of Provincial Councils. Therefore, these entities should also be held responsible for this crisis. Unfortunately, not a single government authority is capable of addressing the issue. This is why I keep suggesting a new authority titled �Municipal Waste Management Authority,� which will be the only authorised body handling the issue.The third problem is fiscal feasibility. To collect one kilogram of garbage, we need Rs. 6-8 and in order to dispose it properly, we need another Rs. 10-12, which is Rs. 16- 20 in all. No one is willing to pay that. Each individual in highly-urbanised areas generate 1kg of garbage a day. So no one is there to pay for their garbage.Lately, you informed the media that garbage collected in Colombo included garbage from other areas. You said kitchen waste was found in effluents released by business establishments. What are the measures you suggest to stop this menace?We witnessed this in buildings belonging to the government. People bring their garbage from home and dispose them in their office. We have inquired about this from maintenance workers and directed them not to allow people bring garbage from outside.What are the infrastructure facilities already available to combat the garbage crisis? What more do you need?Technically, we need to have a proper waste collection system. We have already increased the frequency of it. There are three types of garbage -- biodegradable waste (kitchen and food waste), recyclable garbage (pure polythene, cardboard and paper) and soiled polythene (pampers, sanitary pads and bits clinical waste). Out of these, biodegradable waste can be simply converted to compost. Now we are developing infrastructure for a proper garbage collection scheme. The details of this will be given to the people and relevant institutions. It will be monitored by the Environmental Police, and the Army will oversee the process.Meanwhile, the Colombo Beautification Unit will take stringent measures against those who do not abide by the directive.We have also earmarked a huge land in Kerawalapitiya which will be used for composting. We are now receiving 400 metric tons of biodegradable and 100 metric tons of recyclable waste each day. Also, we have a different place to dispose clinical waste;nearly 10 tons of waste collected from hospitals is burnt here.We will have three incineration plants soon; constructions will commence on August 10. The final disposal site in Aruwakkaru is not meant for garbage collected in Colombo, but for those collected from the North Western� Province. As it is a sanitary landfill like the one in Dompe, there is no fear of any environmental damage.What did you gather from the discussions held with local government authorities as far as this issue is concerned?The country is crammed with issues, especially Colombo. First, the CMC is having an issue in finding a garbage disposal site. After the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed, relevant government entities were not allowed to dump garbage in Karadiyana. Later, they moved to Seeduwa where they faced serious public protest. Then they moved to Dompe and yet again, public protests halted them from disposing garbage there. Next, they moved to a private land in Muthurajawela and the judiciary banned them from dumping garbage there as well, making them helpless and hopeless. �As such, garbage kept piling up. There was no place to dispose them and even though they had appealed to the people to segregate waste, all they got was unsegregated waste which was rejected by garbage collectors. So people resorted to disposing garbage haphazardly as there was no political authority to stop this nefarious act.�""When we start generating energy, it means we are making more money. But at the end of the day, we cannot use waste to generate net energy""�We are in the process of addressing these grave concerns. Within the next 30 days, we will set up a hotline to receive people�s complaints over the garbage issue.Also, we will establish community centres (Praja Mandalas), consisting 500 people selected by the CMC as well as the Environmental Police, to lead the collection and segregation of waste in government buildings, private institutions and other establishments.We will have a tracking system installed in each garbage truck. As at now, the Colombo Beautification Unit engages in two inspections a day; one from 4.00 a.m. to 6.00 a.m. and the other from 3.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m.The unit reports directly to the collectors and control centres so that we can identify the places where garbage has not been collected. If the collectors fail to attend to these complaints, they will be fined. We are also establishing proper composting sites which will be operative from the first week of August. At least now, two thirds of the waste will be made into compost or will be recycled. The remainder will be attended to, when the incineration plants are active.Previously, garbage simply dumped in Meethotamulla. Colombo was cleaned and cleared, but there were four garbage mountains in Karadiyana, Meethotamulla, Manelgama and Peliyagoda.Colombo is labelled as a city filled with domestic waste. As this unfortunate situation could possibly worsen day-by-day, this fast-developing city could be threatened with clinical waste, shredded tyres and sewage sludge. What are your thoughts?We have already established a burner to burn the clinical waste from hospitals. The other waste will also be incinerated properly. Whatever cannot be reused and recycled will be burnt in the three incineration plants that will be set up soon.Is burning clinical waste the best solution?Burning clinical waste at high temperature is the only solution, and there will be no health hazard from it. However, burning clinical waste at low temperature would pose serious health problems.Compact power is used by local waste-to-energy plants to dispose garbage that cannot be recycled. This is practised in many parts of the world including England. Why hasn�t Sri Lanka adopted such a mechanism? After all, this is a money-making machine.I would like to reiterate that we are planning to develop what are known as �Incineration Plants.� Also, we are segregating waste to make compost, and recycling and dumping garbage in sanitary landfills. The only concern is that the countries which follow the compact power concept charges people a �Tipping Fee� for each ton of garbage, meaning people pay for the waste they generate.So why not make money out of garbage?We do, actually. Compost is money, as is recycling. When we start generating energy, it means we are making more money. But at the end of the day, we cannot use waste to generate net energy. For instance, in Coal, the energy content is fivefold than of normal garbage. So it is not for power generation.Are you aware of the standard practice followed in waste disposal in developing countries?It is simply to dump. The most economical way to handle this is to have a sanitary landfill. This is the practice followed by most of the low and middle income countries. High income countries use incineration plants.Is it not a mutual responsibility where the public too have to support this healthy initiative?Indeed. People should change their �not in my backyard� attitude. This is their waste. Not only should they segregate their waste, they should pay for it too. We expect them to acknowledge our genuine efforts and extend a helping hand for this worthy cause. �How are you going to direct the people to this social responsibility?We will organise awareness programmes in Colombo. People should reduce their waste. Maybe they can make use of reusable products. They should be held responsible for their own waste.The Central Environment Authority (CEA) imposed a ban on polythene, lunch sheets, rigifoam boxes and shopping bags with effect from September. Do you consider this as a positive move?I think it�s about time we do away with lunch sheet and go back with reusable lunch boxes. However, I believe a total ban is not possible right now. It should be implemented phase by phase.How does this affect collected garbage?There is a huge impact. Polythene has become a major concern as it is difficult to be recycled. It is also responsible for the prevalent Dengue epidemic as it creates a conducive environment for mosquitoes.A court order was issued preventing the dumping of garbage at Muthurajawela. Is it not a land owned by an authority that comes under your ministry?No. It comes under the purview of the Wildlife Department. And I must say that the judges and court should give us a solution before they issue such a ruling. Why Meethotamulla? It was because of former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva who ordered the CMC to dump garbage there. The court should not interfere with all these issues. Courts can prevent garbage being dumped in environmentally-sensitive areas, but are not the authority to do so. The president gazetted garbage collection as an essential service and it has been approved by the parliament. The court should adhere to that.So what you infer is that the court should also support the process?Certainly. No one can stop garbage collection and dumping.Finally, what is your message to the public?People should change their attitude. They should be more supportive. There is no other way to handle this dilemma. Every state and private sector attribute should be aware that this initiative protects our environment and our lives. Dengue is spreading like wildfire because of this issue. If we don�t address this problem effectively, we will be digging our own graves ingarbage dumps.""The president gazetted garbage collection as an essential service and it has been approved by the parliament.

Cemeteries as Caste-Markers,"2017-07-17 00:32:12							0						 				3784","�""Caste discourse is inevitably hijacked by chauvinist forces. Backward upper caste Tamil elites attempt to consolidate their social power through caste oppression""�In caste-ridden societies, dominant castes claim privilege through birth, but as evident from recent caste conflicts in Jaffna, death provides no relief from caste, and places of cremating the dead are also sites of caste oppression. ��Since late last year, there have been increasing agitations against upper caste cemeteries located within oppressed caste villages. While many of these cemeteries were not used for years if not decades during the war, efforts to again start cremating in those cemeteries culminated in a significant protest numbering to hundreds in front of the Jaffna Bus Stand on May 13, 2017. �During the first two weeks of July, the situation has further deteriorated. In Thidatpulam village in Punnalaikadduvan North, the upper castes hurriedly forced a cremation to make a point. In Kalaimathi village in Puttur, a continual Satyagraha protest has been launched following the arrest of villagers strongly opposed to rebuilding a cemetery in their village. �Post-war re-consolidation�In Jaffna society, as with much of South Asia, caste was the predominant social structure. Furthermore, the unique demographics and small-holding landed relations of Jaffna, with the dominant Vellala caste constituting a numerical majority, characterised an extremely strong caste structure. ��In the 1960s and into the 1970s, there was a powerful movement for temple entry by oppressed caste people excluded from caste-ridden temples, including the Mavittapuram temple, as well as determined struggles for equal seating in public spaces, particularly tea shops where oppressed caste people were humiliated. While these struggles led by the Communist Party, and at the cost of a number of activists� lives, did not eradicate caste, they were nevertheless a major blow to untouchability in Jaffna. ��In the post-war years, with resettlement and return to village quarters, caste is re-consolidating through stealth in Jaffna. While caste is hardly discussed in public, subtle forms of caste exclusion characterise social institutions such as temples and community centres. ��The economic conditions of the oppressed caste communities, who are often landless and depend on day wage labour, aggravate the dynamics of social exclusion. Oppressed caste village quarters are the last to receive rural roads, electricity and water supply, as caste exclusion is embedded in the workings of local officials. Furthermore, the most deprived oppressed caste children remain in the village schools, while other villagers who have the wherewithal send their children to urban schools. Thus many rural schools in Jaffna today consist exclusively of oppressed caste children, whose future is trapped in cycles and spaces of exclusion and depravity. ��Cemetery strugglesOver the last year, such subtle form of caste exclusion, have become more visible through a series of caste confrontations around upper caste cemeteries located at the centre of oppressed caste villages. In October 2016, in Thidatpulam, the Vellala community from Punnalaikadduvan North attempted to reassert their control over a cemetery after decades. The Thidatpulam villagers, many of whom continue to depend on wage labour in the landed upper caste villages, refused the use of the cemetery, where a few families had encroached and built houses over the years. The Vellala leaders got hired sword-wielding gangs to camp out in the cemetery and attempted to build the wall around the cemetery. ��Eventually, the confrontation turned violent, and the community centre and reading room of Thidatpulam was defaced with used oil, even as the villagers claim bias by local officials and the police in not addressing their complaints. In the course of heated exchanges, the oppressed caste villagers were reminded by the Vellala perpetrators of the two young men from Thidatpulam who were murdered in 1982. The fear evoked by incidents over three decades ago reflect the depth of caste oppression and violence, which can haunt generations into the future. ���""Such calls on officials to change the locations and character of cemeteries have fallen on deaf ears""�Starting in March 2017, a similar cemetery in Puttur has become the site of a major struggle. The people in this relatively larger Kalaimathy village, a left stronghold, are far more determined. The confrontations that ensued when the neighbouring villages, both upper caste and oppressed caste, attempted to cremate in a cemetery adjoining Kalaimathy village, has led to police action. Currently, 28 villagers were arrested allegedly of breaking the cemetery wall, remain in custody for over a week, and the villagers in recent days have launched a continual Satyagraha struggle to bring awareness to the issue of cemeteries amidst people�s dwellings and are demanding that the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) address the issue. ��The main grievance of these oppressed caste villages against such cemeteries are environmental concerns and health hazards as well as the social taboo and indignity they suffer when bodies are cremated in such proximity to their homes. The affected villagers claim that even animals run with body parts in these poorly maintained cemeteries, and the experience of cremations near their homes cause severe psychological stress, particularly to their children. Indeed, there are many more cemeteries isolated from people�s houses that can be used instead. At the heart of insisting on cremating in these oppressed caste villages is an arrogant imposition of tradition relating to caste identified cemeteries, which have now become important caste markers. ��Political responseLocal officials are not immune from caste prejudice. In fact, the Pradeshya Sabhas, which in turn come under the NPC, have done little to address the problem. In fact, without proper maintenance, most of these cemeteries are environmental hotspots in a time when the spread of dengue is a serious concern. ��A review and reduction of the large number of cemeteries in Jaffna could concentrate cremations in a few locations away from people�s dwellings. The scarcity of land in Jaffna is another reason to limit such cemeteries, where such land can be used for housing and public spaces for social activities including as sports grounds. �Such calls on officials to change the locations and character of cemeteries have fallen on deaf ears. And instead, the courts have been called to adjudicate, where court judgements merely call for building a high wall and implement electric incinerators, which is impractical in terms of the cost given the infrequent cremations.��Chauvinist forcesCaste discourse is inevitably hijacked by chauvinist forces. Backward upper caste Tamil elites attempt to consolidate their social power through caste oppression. On the other hand, as some recent interventions in the media illustrate Sinhala Buddhist nationalists also attempt to use the caste issue towards their own chauvinist project of attacking Tamil society and undermining devolution. ��While solidarity from the other communities should be welcome when there is oppression within one community, the terms of that solidarity are important. If progressive Sinhala actors can begin a dialogue on caste exclusion in Sri Lankan society, including in the Sinhala community, of how for example it affects marriage, social life and electoral politics, it can contribute towards meaningful and new avenues of discussing the severity caste oppression in Tamil society. ��Solidarity with people struggling against caste oppression is urgently needed, but in supporting these struggles such solidarity should also challenge the nexus of state power and class power that sit comfortably with caste power. The ongoing cemetery conflicts in Jaffna and the response of different actors are important signals of how the deeper dynamics of caste oppression are going to be addressed in the years ahead. ��",dengue

Unabated climate change would reverse hard-earned development gains in Asia �ADB report,"2017-07-15 00:00:18							0						 				612","Unabated climate change would bring devastating consequences to countries in Asia and the Pacific, which could severely affect their future growth, reverse current development gains, and degrade quality of life, according to a report produced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).Under a business-as-usual scenario, a 6 degree Celsius temperature increase is projected over the Asian landmass by the end of the century. Some countries in the region could experience significantly hotter climates, with temperature increases in Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the northwest part of the People�s Republic of China (PRC) projected to reach 8 degree Celsius, according to the report, titled �A Region at Risk: The Human Dimensions of Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific.�These increases in temperature would lead to drastic changes in the region�s weather system, agriculture and fisheries sectors, land and marine biodiversity, domestic and regional security, trade, urban development, migration, and health. Such a scenario may even pose an existential threat to some countries in the region and crush any hope of achieving sustainable and inclusive development.�The global climate crisis is arguably the biggest challenge human civilization faces in the 21st century, with the Asia and Pacific region at the heart of it all,� said Bambang Susantono, ADB Vice-President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development. �Home to two-thirds of the world�s poor and regarded as one of the most vulnerable region to climate change, countries in Asia and the Pacific are at the highest risk of plummeting into deeper poverty � and disaster � if mitigation and adaptation efforts are not quickly and strongly implemented.��The Asian countries hold Earth�s future in their hands. If they choose to protect themselves against dangerous climate change, they will help to save the entire planet,� said Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, PIK Director. �The challenge is twofold. On the one hand, Asian greenhouse-gas emissions have to be reduced in a way that the global community can limit planetary warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, as agreed in Paris 2015. Yet even adapting to 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise is a major task. So, on the other hand, Asian countries have to find strategies for ensuring prosperity and security under unavoidable climate change within a healthy global development. But note that leading the clean industrial revolution will provide Asia with unprecedented economic opportunities. And exploring the best strategies to absorb the shocks of environmental change will make Asia a crucial actor in 21st-century multilateralism.�More intense typhoons and tropical cyclones are expected to hit Asia and the Pacific with rising global mean temperatures. Under a business-as-usual scenario, annual precipitation is expected to increase by up to 50 percent over most land areas in the region, although countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan may experience a decline in rainfall by 20-50 percent.Coastal and low-lying areas in the region will be at an increased risk of flooding. Nineteen of the 25 cities most exposed to a one-meter sea-level rise are located in the region, 7 of which are in the Philippines alone. Indonesia, however, will be the most affected country in the region by coastal flooding with approximately 5.9 million people expected to be affected every year until 2100.Increased vulnerability to flooding and other disasters will significantly impact the region � and the world � economically. Global flood losses are expected to increase to US$52 billion per year by 2050 from US$6 billion in 2005. Moreover, 13 of the top 20 cities with the largest growth of annual flood losses from 2005-2050 are in Asia and the Pacific: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Zhanjiang, and Xiamen (PRC); Mumbai, Chennai-Madras, Surat, and Kolkata (India); Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam); Jakarta (Indonesia); Bangkok (Thailand); and Nagoya (Japan).Climate change will also make food production in the region more difficult and production costs higher. In some countries of Southeast Asia, rice yields could decline by up to 50 percent by 2100 if no adaptation efforts are made. Almost all crops in Uzbekistan, meanwhile, are projected to decrease by 20-50 percent by 2050 even in a 2 degree Celsius temperature increase (Paris Agreement scenario). Food shortages could increase the number of malnourished children in South Asia by 7 million, as import costs will likely increase in the subregion to US$15 billion per year compared to US$2 billion by 2050.Marine ecosystems, particularly in the Western Pacific, will be in serious danger by 2100. All coral reef systems in the subregion will collapse due to mass coral bleaching if global warming increases by 4 degree Celsius (global business-as-usual scenario). Even with a 1.5 degree Celsius temperature increase, 89 percent of coral reefs are expected to suffer from serious bleaching, severely affecting reef-related fisheries and tourism in Southeast Asia.Climate change also poses a significant risk to health in Asia and the Pacific. Already, 3.3 million people die every year due to the harmful effects of outdoor air pollution, with the PRC, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh being the top four countries experiencing such deaths. In addition, heat-related deaths in the region among the elderly are expected to increase by about 52,000 cases by 2050 due to climate change, according to data from the World Health Organization. Deaths related to vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue may also increase. A business-as-usual approach to climate change could also disrupt functioning ecosystem services, prompting mass migration � mostly to urban areas � that could make cities more crowded and overwhelm available social services.Moreover, a warmer climate for the region could endanger energy supply. Climate change can exacerbate energy insecurity through continued reliance on unsustainable fossil fuels, reduced capacities of thermal power plants due to a scarcity of cooling water, and intermittent performance of hydropower plants as a result of uncertain water discharges, among other factors. Energy insecurity could lead to conflicts as countries compete for limited energy supply.To mitigate the impact of climate change, the report highlights the importance of implementing the commitments laid out in the Paris Agreement. These include public and private investments focused on the rapid decarbonization of the Asian economy as well as the implementation of adaptation measures to protect the region�s most vulnerable populations. Climate mitigation and adaptation efforts should also be mainstreamed into macro-level regional development strategies and micro-level project planning in all sectors, in addition to the ongoing renewable energy and technology innovation efforts in urban infrastructure and transport.

Battle Against Dengu,"2017-07-14 00:00:10							0						 				1459","With dengue mosquitoes wreaking havoc in the lives of patients, it has become a tedious task in today�s context to curtail the escalation of dengue mosquitoes in the environment. Despite the numerous Shramadana efforts and dengue awareness programmes being carried out countrywide, mitigating the dengue menace completely would be a dream come true. Since �Prevention is better than cure�,�Dailymirror�highlights a number of practical and effective, preventive measures to eradicate the mosquito menace as indicated by several experts.�An inventor comes up with a solutionAccording to the World Health Organization, the incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades. The organization�s reports on the disease revealed that the actual numbers of dengue cases is under reported and many cases are misclassified. �One recent estimate indicates 390 million dengue infections per year of which 96 million manifest clinically. Another study, of the prevalence of dengue, estimates that 3.9 billion people, in 128 countries, are at risk of infection with dengue viruses. The year 2016 was characterized by large dengue outbreaks worldwide. It�s clear that the dengue is an epidemic beyond simple means of control, not only in Sri Lanka. �Former Deputy General Manager of the Ceylon Steel Corporation, Engineer Sarath Jayakuru is an inventor with a vision to rid the country of the disastrous dengue epidemic. His invention, a simple �mosquito trap� won the Presidential Merit Award in 2001. However he laments that the simple, cheap and easy-to-make equipment that could have greatly alleviated households of this burden, has been ignored over the past 17 years. With the exception of a doctor from Kurunegala who endeavoured to make use of this invention in every school and household, the attention his �mosquito trap� received has been insignificant. My invention isn�t profitable, but practical, he adds. He shared his thoughts and innovative ideas with the Dailymirror�, with the hope that health authorities, will take due notice and take his fresh approach forward in battling the deadly disease. ��So far the key theme in tackling this menace is based on a �seek and destroy� approach of breeding places. This is no easy task and not practicable in sustaining over long periods. It seems that approach alone isn�t effective, since dengue has risen to epidemic proportions and therefore needs more attacking fronts,� Jayakuru said. �He lists out some logical ideas in the control of the disease, both short term (ST) and long term (LT) for serious consideration of those in authority, bold enough to think afresh and act differently. �1)�The first priority should be to prevent mosquitoes biting the infected patient either by isolation, covering with a net or applying a repellent lotion to the exposed parts of the body. A dengue patient is the real source of spreading the disease and not the mosquito as most people tend to believe. It only transports the virus to a healthy person. Netting used to cover bed etc, should be made duty- free, affordable and even given free to families with infants, as long term solutions. Making nets would be an added income to the rural folks and a double bonus to society. Repellents are presently very expensive and should be made duty-free or inexpensive. Citronella oil, camphor oil etc. should be given free to school children in affected areas. (ST) �One recent estimate indicates 390 million dengue infections per year of which 96 million manifest clinically. Another study, of the prevalence of dengue, estimates that 3.9 billion people, in 128 countries, are at risk of infection with dengue viruses2)�Fogging is a short term solution. However, this is disastrous to the eco-system even destroying the mosquito�s natural enemy, the dragonfly. They are hardly seen at present unlike in the 60�s and 70�s when mosquitoes were not an issue. Now that the damage is done, it should be carried out on 4 to 5 consecutive days to completely wipe out the new mosquitoes that generate at various stages, from larvae left behind in the area. There is no sense in fogging just for one day since larvae are not affected. �3)�Release of Dragonflies to the environment is a long term solution as they are the natural enemies of mosquitoes, in both adult and larvae stages. They are harmless to humans and should be specially propagated in large numbers and released. Once established, fumigation (fogging) should not be done. �4)�Island-wide usage of the Mosquito (larvae) Trap (LT). This is a device that costs nothing which destroys the larvae indefinitely, with minimum of attention. According to Sarath Jayakuru, the viability of his invention is that it can be left unattended for prolonged periods, except in the case of traps kept inside houses which would have to be refilled occasionally to make up for evaporation. As for traps kept outside, they can be allowed to fill with rainwater, having been screened with a mesh. �5)�Controlled killing of larvae, a short term approach involves keeping troughs of water in the open for mosquitoes to lay eggs. These troughs must be replaced with fresh water once a week on a particular day, eg: Monday, to make it a regular habit. The purpose of this is to destroy new generations of mosquitoes and also to prevent them from flying 2 to 3 km per day, in search of breeding places while spreading the disease in that radius . However Jayakuru opines that his invention �the mosquito trap� is a safer alternative. �6)�Release of �Oxitec �re-engineered mosquitoes is another short term alternative. These are male mosquitoes produced by the million by �Oxitec� a company developed by Oxford University and presently owned by a US company. The male mosquito mates with the dengue mosquito (Aedes Aegypti) to produce larvae that do not survive. Field trials done by Bill Gates Foundation and University of Sao Paulo in Camen Island and Brazil respectively, resulted in 80 to 95% reduction in mosquito population in 11 weeks. Successful trials have been done in Malaysia, Panama and in Florida in 2016. �Hadyn Parry re-engineered mosquitoes to fight diseases� on Youtube is a useful TED talk on the subject. Also search�Oxitec �Wikipedia� for more information. �Even though the main method to control or prevent the transmission of dengue virus is to combat vector mosquitoes, a fresh, adaptive and innovative approach is urgent to battle this buzzing menace. An active approach of monitoring and surveillance of vectors, as mentioned above should be carried out to determine effectiveness of control interventions, an approach we are yet to witness in reality, by local authorities tasked with tackling the disease. ����Prevention of Dengue�Thinking out of the boxIs the strategy employed to fight Dengue, the fiercest enemy that the country is currently battling, successful? Even though the authorities are in denial, the fact that there�s no significant reduction in Dengue despite all preventative measures being taken each day, the disease is spreading throughout the country like wildfire and can�t be ignored. Speaking to Dr. Lal Jayasinghe, the Dailymirror� explored the possibilities of whether alternate strategies can be used in the prevention of Dengue. It must be noted that the objective here is not to belittle the massive effort taken by hundreds of officials to fight this battle, but to open up our reader�s minds to the alternate possibilities that might exist, which, combined with the current strategies, will improve the efficiency of the remedies.���The following are excerpts of the interview done with Dr. Jayasinghe, who served as a MOH in Sri Lanka on two occasions, once in 1960s and again in 1990s. He also worked in the Public Health Department of the Ministry of Health in 1990s. In between he worked in UK where his was associated with public health. His possesses the qualifications MBBS, DPH, MRCP. �Q�What is the present strategy adopted by the government and why is dengue still skyrocketing despite all efforts?The government�s view is that dengue can be controlled only by eradicating mosquito breeding sites from environments close to homes. This strategy may have appeared sensible 25 years ago when we had few cases. In spite of the ever increasing number of dengue cases, the government hasn�t changed its strategy at all. I have highlighted in my report to President Maithripala Sirisena, that although the number of mosquito breeding sites has dropped, dengue cases keep increasing. Does this not indicate that the strategy isn�t working? viously the strategy isn�t working and that�s why the number of cases is rising daily. �Q�Why should we focus on transmission of the virus itself?Unfortunately in Sri Lanka, the impression has been created that the cause of dengue is the mosquito. This impression is further strengthened by the fact that when dengue is always mentioned in any media there�s a picture of a mosquito. Dengue is spread by the mosquito acquiring the virus from a dengue patient, incubating for 8-10 days and infecting a healthy person by its sting. So the way to stop the epidemic is by breaking this chain. In other words, stopping the virus either getting into a mosquito and/or stopping the mosquito transferring the virus to a new person. It�s the virus that causes the illness and not the mosquito. ��Q�Is this method feasible ? How?Even though, on a yearly basis, there are thousands of dengue patients, if you take an average day in the year there are only a limited number of cases in the country. To give an example, until the end of June this year, i.e 182 days, there were 77000 dengue patients reported. Let�s assume that the cases were reported on an equal and regular basis (this is of course not the way they are reported. But we will assume so to illustrate the point). Then every day 77000/182 new patients will develop dengue. As the disease lasts on average 1 week, on any day in the country there were 77000/182 x 7 = 2962 patients either at home or in hospital. All of the dengue viruses in Sri Lanka were inside these 2962 patients (and of course the infected mosquitoes). In other words the virus is trapped. If we stop these patients being bitten by mosquitoes the virus will die. We may not be able to prevent all of these patients being bitten by mosquitoes. That doesn�t matter because if we prevent a good number of patients being bitten and continue to do so for a period of weeks, the number of patients associated with the virus will gradually reduce and the disease will eventually disappear.�QHow should we overcome the practical problems that we face in implementing this programme?We need to protect the dengue patients in hospitals. The best arrangement is to house them in designated wards. Even though there is some cost involved, the best option is to either air condition the wards or if that isn�t practical, because of the building, to surround the ward using mosquito netting. This may sound expensive. What is the worth of human life? How many have died this year? Was it their fault? If you read the newspapers you will observe that millions are being spent on �unnecessary projects. The patients at home should be protected by both mosquito nets and insect repellents as nets alone aren�t sufficient due to patients moving around the house. �QDoes adopting this method mean we should reduce or give up altogether the measures to control mosquito breeding?�Certainly not. Mosquitoes are a nuisance even if they don�t cause dengue. In addition the less mosquitoes present, the less chance for them to reach a dengue patient and spread the disease. The mistake is to limit the strategy to control breeding only. There are other things that can be done to prevent mosquito bites. The houses can be screened with netting or the curtains can be impregnated with insect repellent. The interior of houses can be checked to ensure no mosquitoes are resting within. People can wear clothes to cover their arms and legs. Recently a very good suggestion was made that younger boys too should wear long trousers to school. The suggestion was made, according to the press report because the educational authorities had noticed that children who were catching dengue were those wearing shorts. ��QWhat is the role of the public in implementing this strategy �As with any other strategy, the public have a very important role to play regarding this strategy as well. Not all dengue patients are hospitalized. In fact if the public managed to protect all or at least the majority of dengue patients at home, that alone will help eradicate dengue in the future. The importance of protecting patients in hospitals is to set an example and highlight the importance associated with protecting dengue patients from mosquitoes. The day when the public get to know the real story behind dengue, they on their own initiative will protect all fever patients, irrespective of eventual diagnosis, and the epidemic will end. The sooner that day arrives, sooner the epidemic will end. The media has a role to play in educating the public on the true nature of dengue transmission. �We have an advantage over other countries because we are an island. All the dengue viruses living in Sri Lanka are made in Sri Lanka! They haven�t arrived here from other countries. If we stop growing them in our bodies the virus will eventually die. Singapore doesn�t have this advantage because everyday, thousands of workers, students and vehicles arrive in Singapore from Malaysia and other countries. Some of them no doubt bring the virus, if not the mosquitoes. ��QAre there any lessons that we can learn from how Sri Lanka eradicated Malaria, that will help with the prevention of dengue?The lesson we can learn from Malaria and Filariasis eradication from Sri Lanka is that in both cases we eliminated the causative organism, not the vector i.e the mosquito. In fact for a long time we tried to control both disease by controlling the vector, but without success. By finding malaria cases and treating them we killed the causative organism within the patient, hence it couldn�t infect another person. By repeatedly doing this over a period with regard to each patient, we finally got rid of the malaria parasite from the whole of Sri Lanka. In the case of filariasis we didn�t treat the patients only, but the whole population and in the process caught all the parasites in one go. Unfortunately we have no effective treatment for dengue, so we cannot use the method we used for malaria and filariasis.However there is one weakness associated with the dengue virus and we can use to eliminate it. The virus can live in a person for 7 days only. It has to find another person within the 7 days or die. If we protect all patients with the virus from mosquitoes we will succeed as we did with malaria and filariasis. In fact we know the people who are harbouring the virus, namely the dengue patients. As I said before there are only a few thousand of them at any given time.�In the case of filariasis we didn�t treat the patients only, but the whole population and in the process caught all the parasites in one go�I know there are people who will say that we don�t know all the dengue patients, so we cannot do it. But there is something we know about dengue patients. They have fever. Some will immediately say not all fever patients have dengue. Some others will say that some dengue patients wont have fever. This is my answer to the first lot. What is the harm in preventing mosquitoes from biting fever patients who do not have dengue? If we were prepared to give drugs to people who we didn�t know they had filariasis in order to get rid of the filarial worm, why are we reluctant to prevent mosquitoes from biting fever patients? Not everybody in the country had filariasis? The answer to those that highlights the existence of dengue patients without fever is that. It doesn�t matter if we missed some cases because they didn�t have fever. We missed some malaria patients and it didn�t matter. And two, it is not clear that dengue patients without fever are a threat because they may not have enough virus in them to transmit via a mosquito bite. �Dr. Jayasinghe�s strategy focusing on isolation of suspected Dengue is in fact, not a new practice to Sri Lankan culture. We have been keeping people who have highly infectious diseases like Mumps and Chickenpox in isolation since the old times. Some small scale campaigns inspired by the idea put forward by Dr. Jayasinghe are currently being carried out island wide. It is the responsibility of the personnel in charge to give due attention and take necessary steps towards implementation.�Let�s arm ourselves against this menace!Integrated Vector Management as preventionSpeaking to Daily Mirror, Community Physician attached to the Dengue Control Unit Dr. Prachila Samaraweera said that at present the Dengue Control Unit is entrusted with the responsibility of carrying out an Integrated Vector Management system to eradicate the threat of dengue mosquitoes. She said that under the Integrated Vector Management system, the unit is targeting source reduction, adult mosquitoe control and larvae control. �Dr. Himantha Atukorale, Vavuniya General Hospital��As a measure of prevention, currently we are focusing on Source Reduction where we seek out the potential breeding grounds of dengue mosquitoes and destroy them. Also, we carry out fumigation procedures as part of controlling the risk of adult mosquitoes in the environment. Usually, fogging is carried out in areas that are most prone to be detected with adult mosquitoes. Additionally, we are constantly focusing on larvae control using chemicals� she said. �As a measure of prevention, currently we are focusing on Source Reduction where we seek out the potential breeding grounds of dengue mosquitoes and destroy them�In addition to the above, the Presidential Task Force is carrying out cleaning programmes in public and private institutes; especially in schools. It has been made mandatory to allocate an hour to clean all institutions at least once a week as a prevention step. It is also pivotal to ensure that one�s home environment is maintained clean. Roof gutters, drains and canals, lavatory systems and any place prone to the accumulation of water needs to be cleaned and maintained properly. The public is therefore bound to play a proactive role in help preventing the risk of dengue mosquitoes� Dr. Samaraweera added. ���Try these two steps�Speaking to Daily Mirror, Consultant Rheumatologist at the Vavuniya General Hospital, Dr. Himantha Atukorale stressed the need to employ practical methods in curbing the deadly mosquito carrying the dengue virus. He stated that Dengue virus doesn�t get transmitted from generation to another generation of mosquitoes nor does it �Run in the family�. According to him, it requires the help of a hapless human being in order for the virus to pass on. ���Firstly, use nets to cover the dengue patient from the mosquitoes. If fresh mosquitoes don�t bite on patients, there is no way for the insect to acquire the virus. The virus swims within the blood of patients during fever days and could last in the blood stream for about four days after the onset of fever. The patient should be protected from the mosquito even after the onset of fever that lasts for four days. However this is very difficult to be carried out in the hospital set up. In crowded wards where nets aren�t possible, smoke fumigation might help to keep away the insects� Dr. Atukorale said. ���Secondly, we should somehow promote the simple �Plastic bottle egg trap�. The bottles are cut and assembled in such a way that when filled with water, it lures the mosquito to lay eggs. Gravity causes the eggs to fall in to a separate bottom section of the bottle. But the larvae coming out of eggs are unable to fly away. If many such traps are made available in the environment, it�ll render eggs useless and cut down the mosquito population in half. So let�s trap the virus inside patients, and trap the eggs inside bottles during this time of calamity� he added.��",dengue

Anti-corruption drive left for dead now,"2017-07-13 01:14:30							0						 				2282","The future of the Anti-Corruption Secretariat, which primarily directed complaints to be investigated by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), still remains uncertain as the government leaders could not see eye-to-eye on it at Tuesday�s Cabinet meeting. ��The Secretariat, established after the new government assumed office in 2015, was entrusted with the task of referring cases of corruption and frauds to the FCID for investigation and prosecution. ��Its period lapsed. Amidst uncertainty over its future, President Maithripala Sirisena took a swipe at the law enforcement authorities saying the cases involving mass scale corruption and frauds were being swept under the carpet due to political influence. Also, he charged that the law enforcement authorities were acting with political interests in mind when dealing with allegations of corruption and frauds involving the higher-ups of the former rule. Instead, he charged that some people responsible for minor or negligible offences, were taken to task for political ends. ��	Law enforcement body acts with former rulers� whims	Sprats netted; sharks at large	Anti- Corruption Secretariat - a white elephant?	FCID, AG�s Dept should have been sharper in dealing with cases involving former regime�	WHO stresses swift, tangible action to curb spread of dengue	Dengue affects tourism industry�	SLFPers to quit Govt.?	NFF wants JO to quit Constitution-making process�In this instance, President looked perturbed over action initiated against State Ministers A.H.M. Fowzie and Priyankara Jayaratne. ��The President�s prime concern was the failure on the part of the FCID and the Attorney General�s Department to dispense with cases involving his erstwhile colleague and predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family members. A week after the presidential tirade, a Cabinet paper was presented to the meeting on Tuesday seeking the extension of the Anti-Corruption Secretariat to function further under the purview of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. ��President Sirisena is reported to have refused to grant his nod to this move. He took the position that the investigative authorities like the Bribery Commission would be able to proceed with the current lot of cases referred to them, and therefore there was no need to have the Anti-Corruption Secretariat. Most Cabinet Ministers subscribed to this stance of the President. ��The President remarked that if the Anti-Corruption Secretariat were to function under the PM further, it would give rise to the perception that the anti-corruption drive of the government had been politicized. ��The paper, presented by the PM, was deferred to the next week for consideration. According to sources close to the President, the Anti- Corruption Secretariat would die a natural death as most viewed it as a white elephant not serving the intended purpose. ��Dengue stings Cabinet�With the spread of Dengue viral flu reaching alarming proportions, the govt is grappling for containing the escalation of it. The situation is so alarming that the representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) made a presentation to the Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday detailing out the current trend and stressing for action forthwith. ��According to statistics available with the hospital system, there are as many as 83,000 cases reported so far. However, the WHO representatives said the number could be much higher. In fact, they said it could be well over 100,000 with cases not reported to the hospitals so far. ��The hospitals are packed with Dengue patients in the Colombo district. In some instances, the hospital authorities refuse to admit patients for treatment during the initial days of the disease. ��After the presentation, the President stressed the need or a continual, concerted effort to curb the spread of Dengue. Finally, it was decided to declare a Dengue eradication week. The President suggested that all the politicians should be actively involved in the clean-up operations to destroy mosquito breeding grounds. The Cabinet decided to focus more on abandoned or unoccupied premises as they could have unattended mosquito breeding places. ��For this purpose, the health authorities initially conducted fogging operations. It has not worked properly as transpired during the presentation, because Dengue larvae can thrive in tiny covered spots. It stings during daytime, and as such, precautions taken after nightfall are also not effective. ��Dengue hits tourism industry�The Dengue crisis has hit the tourism industry with cancellations of hotel bookings by some foreign nationals. It has triggered fears as to whether the govt would be able to reach the target of 2.5 million arrivals this year. ��Tourism is a thriving industry. Despite setbacks due to the flood disaster and Dengue outbreak, over one million tourists have already visited Sri Lanka so far this year. ���I learnt that some foreign nationals have cancelled their hotel reservations. We believe it is due to Dengue. We have to curb the spread some way or the other. Otherwise, the industry would suffer,� Tourism Promotion Minister John Amaratunga said. ��SLFPers to quit Govt�The unity government will be completing two years in September, outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed for the purpose. Ahead of it, the fissures between the UNP and the SLFP have widened on most issues. It is more so with regard to the anti-corruption drive and the constitution-making process. In fact, some of the SLFP ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers are so disillusioned with the govt that they insist on quitting it on the earliest available day for the move. ��These MPs have already held several rounds of talks with the Joint Opposition at different levels. The exodus from the government is planned on three possible occasions. One is the completion of the two year period outlined in the MoU for the unity government. They believe such a moment can justify their action for parting ways with the UNP. Or else, they contemplate on leaving the government to join hands with the opposition in the event of declaration of any election - be it the local authorities or the provincial council polls. ��As the third option, they believe there would be a point for them to part ways with the govt when it presents the draft of the proposed Constitutions. That is bound to have areas for disagreement between the UNP and the SLFP. Then, it would offer the chance for them to decide whether to be with the government or not. In this manner, these MPs await any of these justifiable moments to make the political move. ��National Freedom Front (NFF), led by MP Wimal Weerawansa, has taken the position that the JO which it represents should stay away from the constitution making process. On behalf of the JO, its parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane and MP Prasanna Ranatunga participated in the deliberations of the Steering Committee appointed for working out proposals for the new Constitution.NFF wants JO to quit Constitution-making process�Wimal Weerawansa announced his stance to the country at a recent press conference. Afterwards, it came up for discussions by the leaders of the JO this week. MP Jayantha Samaraweera who attended the meeting said the govt had worked out an interim report on constitutional proposals regardless of what was discussed at the Steering Committee. Also, the NFF believes that the Mahanayake Theras of the three chapters stressed that there should not be a new Constitution, and their position should be honoured. The JO has not taken a final position in this regard as yet, it would be taken up for consideration next week. ��Dinesh Gunawardane, who is the parliamentary group leader of the JO, said the Constitution- making process was in an utter mess with the govt leaders making contradictory statements. Alongside, he said that he had noted the position taken by the Mahanayake Theras in this regard.��We are considering our position seriously. The final decision will be taken after discussion with all the parties of the JO,� he said. �Besides, he said the JO would not cooperate with the govt on any matter if they kept postponing elections over and over again.�",dengue

Plea for Education Minister�s Consideration,"2017-07-12 01:31:05							0						 				2134","Sri Lanka no doubt is going through a rough patch in its contemporary history. The recent drought that practically made many sources of water dry for some time was followed by devastating flash floods sending many areas under water. Heavy rains and the deluge that followed resulted in destructive landslides claiming many innocent lives at a time most unexpected. Moreover, the monstrous mountain of man-made garbage created havoc by collapsing on adjoining houses in Meethotamulla burying scores in one of the worst tragedies to hit the nation on the eve of the National New Year. Sri Lanka has been hit by multiplicity of calamities occurring in a quick succession in monstrous proportions demonstrating the wrath of nature.�The GCE Advanced Level examination practically determines which route a child has to take in his futureDevastating floods which saw many villages getting submerged in gushing waters resulted in loss of lives and colossal damage to property with scores of families losing all earthly belongings in a flash rendering them destitute. Many have lost the houses they have lived in throughout their lives and found themselves being rendered homeless and left with only the clothes they were wearing. It has been heartrending to witness many helpless school going little ones crying their hearts out in agony having lost all their cherished belongings including text books, and other study material. Losses suffered by children can hardly be recompensed even if they are provided with new books and stationery as the mental trauma, rude shock and horrors to which they were exposed out of the blue are destined to remain and haunt their memories for years to come.�Many such sad stories as usual will remain in the realm of obscurity with focus changing from one crisis to another as time progresses. Many people who struggle hard to make ends meet and keep home fires burning would now have a mammoth task ahead in rebuilding their lives from scratch. To make matters worse, the country is now facing one of the worst health catastrophes in the form of the dengue epidemic which is raging with greater ferocity every passing day fast assuming pandemic proportions in the wake of the flooding. So far this year nearly 76,000 cases of dengue have been reported countrywide with some patients including children succumbing to this lethal affliction.�Many children have contracted dengue and are receiving treatment at several hospitals. With Dengue assuming hyper endemic proportions there is a countrywide red alert on the lethal disease. With the situation aggravating by the day even some of the leading private hospitals find it hard to cater to the enormous demand for admission by the rising number of dengue patients. Moreover people are at their sixes and sevens not knowing what to do with symptoms of the disease varying with each individual case putting the lives of patients at grave risk.�The writer is personally aware of many cases of children being treated for this life-threatening disease and the post-treatment agony the young ones have been compelled to go through due to various forms of physical discomforts disabilities and pain that follow in the wake of the illness. Such debilitating aftereffects in some cases linger for a considerable period preventing the young victims from engaging in productive activities such as studies, sports or any form of vocational training.�As usual the blame game and buck passing continues with the core of the problem largely remaining unaddressed. Although proud pronouncements are made from elevated podiums ostensibly for public consumption, there is lack of a robust and coherent action plan to address the core issue, the eradication of deadly virus. No one needs rocket science to tackle it if there is a genuine will on the part of those calling the shots in the body politic to take necessary action. People have seen how hurriedly politicos take action when it comes to matters that work for their benefit irrespective of whether they are of any common public interest or otherwise, and it is well known that politicos are predominantly motivated by self-serving agendas. One of the main challenges faced by parents who have been fortunate enough to save the precious lives of their children from the deadly disease is consistently taking proper preventive measures or preventing relapses in an effective manner as there is lack of necessary remedial measures from authorities in many cases. Unless measures are taken at community levels individual action by households would have only a limited scale of success in ensure prevention and avoiding a relapse.�As usual the blame game and buck passing continues with the core of the problem largely remaining unaddressedSchoolchildren were hit by a double whammy of floods and dengue that followed in its wake. It implies a situation where the man fallen from a tree being proverbially gored. This is particularly significant in the case of scores of children who are preparing for their GCE Advanced level examination, as victims of floods or dengue or even of both misfortunes would certainly be at a huge disadvantage in sitting the exam for reasons beyond their control. This situation warrants serious consideration as we are not talking about an illness that has impacted only on some isolated cases with a handful of patients reported.�Some 43% of the dengue cases have been reported from the Western Province with the majority belonging to Colombo and the suburbs. Ongoing disruption of medical facilities caused by trade union action unleashed by the medical fraternity no doubt is exacerbating the issue and worsening the plight of the poor unable to afford private medical treatment. Such hapless ones are forced to seek treatment from vastly overcrowded public hospitals, and in consequence are precariously placed at the mercy of medics preoccupied with trade union actions with urgent need for patient care going out of the window.�The GCE Advanced Level examination practically determines which route a child has to take in his future and it is certainly one of the most critically important turning points in the life of every young person aspiring to reach whatever goals he or she desires. This is where competition matters most, and students are expected to perform at their level best.�The recent catastrophes that occurred in quick succession and dengue which is ferociously raging today tormenting people and recently claimed the life of a female undergraduate of the University of Moratuwa and this resulted in its temporary closure with many children affected by dengue being left with �a colossal disadvantage as compared to their peers, as their ability to perform up to the mark at full potential at the GCE Advanced Level Exam to be held in August �17 has been seriously eroded and undermined by the plague they are suffering from.�The victims of these catastrophes obviously need special considerationThe victims of these catastrophes obviously need special consideration and every possible support to ensure that they would also be able to compete on a level playing field. The best that learned professionals and the considerate Education Minister could do at this critical juncture is to give relief to well deserving student victims by temporarily postponing the GCE Advance level examination until December �17. This will also enable the student to prepare for the examination better whilst helping the Government to conduct this examination in the month of December starting from the next year as it may already have plans to do so.�This is a reasonable plea based on humanitarian grounds. It is being made on behalf of many a student victim suffering in anguish with the sincere hope that it would not fall on deaf ears.�",dengue

Garbage Management: Schools disappointed with the approach,"2017-07-07 00:11:15							1						 				1485","�Garbage has been a huge issue for many months now, both on a domestic level and on school level. With many focusing on what�s on the streets, little attention is paid to what our little girls and boys are going through when it comes to the approach taken by schools to manage their garbage. �The Daily Mirror learnt from students from various leading Colombo schools that the garbage management within the schools is not going as smoothly as it is externally portrayed. Schools have informed their students to bring lunch boxes and to refrain from bringing plastic bags, lunch sheets, regifoam boxes, etc. Some schools have removed the garbage bins from each classroom, not providing the children with a place to throw their daily trash. In one such school students turned to the dustbins in the toilets, which resulted in the closure of all but one bathroom as a punishment. Students have expressed their dissatisfaction with the fact that the schools expect them to put their garbage in their school bags as they are not allowed to bring polythene bags to even collect their trash. Some students also stated that there was only one garbage bin allocated for each building, where you cannot throw paper or plastic. Students have also expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the teachers do not have to follow the same rules of not bringing plastic. Parents too are very discontent with the way the schools are handling garbage management deeming it as �too sudden� and that such practices should be brought in slowly and not in such a rapid manner. Instead of teaching student on how and why they should manage their garbage, schools are trying to solve the problem by getting rid of the garbage created by the students as a whole. ��It was also revealed that certain schools have not adopted any form of managing their garbage with the students and continue to allow children to bring plastic. Some schools even take to burning their paper instead of sending it for recycling. �However, on a brighter note, we also learnt that many schools have adopted the three bin concept inside and outside the classrooms and food served in the canteen is served in paper bags, paper plates or put right into the student�s lunch boxes.� �Speaking to Tissa Hewavithana, Secretary of the State Ministry of Education, the Daily Mirror learnt that the Ministry had sent a circular last year towards the end of December, regarding on how to maintain school premises in order to prevent the spread of dengue. In the circular schools have been asked to reduce the use of plastic and to bring every child to have quality cooked food in lunch boxes. The circular has also asked schools to manage their garbage and become familiar with separating the garbage in bins. Regarding the fact that certain schools had removed the bins from the classrooms as a whole, Mr. Hewavithana advised that maybe they could have three bins in the classrooms to encourage and teach the children on how to separate their daily trash. �He further said, �We need to give the children the necessary knowledge on the management of garbage, on the separation of degradable and non-degradable garbage and its importance which can be done by including this in the syllabus and our textbooks. We have to be a part of this sustainable project where in a short period of time we get the children used to creating less garbage and managing it. What we aim to do is incorporate good habits in our children when it comes to maintaining a healthy environment and managing their garbage.����",dengue

So, every week he keeps undergrads on the roads now.�� �That sarcasm, that cynicism and making fun out of all this anarchy does not lift this society out of the chaos we are fast slipping into. �Much has been written about the SAITM issue and the hooliganism in the medical profession, that has not had any impact on medical practitioners in general and the citizens who are passive victims.� �Nor has the Government taken any worthy steps in resolving the growing menace spilling into the roads on a weekly basis. This now is just anarchy, shamelessly driven by a few Mafiaso in the GMOA and an aimless IUSF. �The not so long history of this SAITM issue reveals a lot about the mafia in the GMOA leadership and it�s petty opportunism. People by now have forgotten that SAITM had other fee levying courses on management and technology that were never opposed.� �Its medical faculty began in 2010 and Prof Carlo Fonseka was the one who approved university status to it by the UGC in November 2011. Prof. Fonseka was thereafter appointed to the Chair of the SLMC on the request of President Rajapaksa on January 2, 2012. �Earlier that the GMOA leadership had its own committee headed by Dr. Padeniya to evaluate the medical degree at SAITM. The Padeniya Committee found SAITM lacking in clinical and community health training and concluded the standard was not adequate for registration with the SLMC as medical practitioners. �The SAITM issue to date saw three SLMC Chairpersons including Prof. Carlo Fonseka idling during the tenure of President Rajapaksa, without taking any serious and workable solution in clearing the SAITM medical faculty lapses. �The same GMOA leadership also played hide and seek with the Rajapaksa regime unnecessarily dragging it for five years from 2010 to 2015 August. �Both parties, the GMOA leadership and the SLMC led by Prof. Carlo Fonseka suddenly woke up to oppose SAITM after the August 2015 Parliamentary elections. �One does not need to dwell any further in elaborating on their politics. �With this sudden waking up after the defeat of Rajapaksa, there is a clear sign of anarchy on the roads. The IUSF is nothing but a political cat�s paw of the �Narodnya Volya� type, Frontline Socialist Party (FSP). The FSP has a history of anarchism. �Before its student gang (The IUSF) broke into the Health Ministry premises, in April 2016 they stormed the Immigration Office demanding the release of their leader Gunaratnam. It was the FSP that tagged IUSF with the GMOA to have their protests on the streets. For the GMOA leadership undergrads on the roads gave a major lift in their post Rajapaksa anti-SAITM campaign. �Demands on SAITM were thus changed over the past one year. ��It began with modest protests over standards on clinical and community health training. The GMOA leadership thereafter opposed fixing up quality, for that would have ended the issue once and for all.� �Instead they moved to a new demand. They then said the SLMC should not under any condition register any SAITM medical graduate.� �That was contested in Courts and the ruling allowed registration. While the SLMC under Prof. Fonseka decided to appeal against the court ruling, with the IUSF on the roads, the demand was changed again to save �Free Education� (None of them knows what it means). Now it is a Shylock type demand, wanting a total closure of SAITM. �Even after the 2015 August elections, this Government too sat over the SAITM issue for one year and 11 months for now without a firm decision.� �Vacillation and hesitancy on the part of the Government and its Cabinet of Ministers making contradictory statements on SAITM, the GMOA and the IUSF had seized this Government inactivity to agitate on the roads.� �The GMOA took it as their strength to decide strike action as they pleased. Buddhist monks and other clergy pleading with these protesters to have some compassion on patients during the dengue epidemic, provide undue legitimacy to these anarchist politics. �What is this �do or die battle� over SAITM worth in terms of��free� education?� ���Closing down of the SAITM will have absolutely no relevance to whatever is meant by �free education� these dumb protesters shout on the streets. These irrational, idiotic protests have nothing to do with �free education�. �It had been very clearly said many times before, there is nothing �free� in education. The cost of education is either borne by parents privately or paid for by the citizens through direct and indirect taxes collected by the Government.� �That was why FUTA wanted a six per cent allocation in the annual budget for education. Calculations made last year with the Government allocating Rs.163 billion for higher education and Rs.77 billion for education, showed that every adult citizen counted as 15 million voters pay around Rs.16,000 annually for education through direct and indirect taxes.� �In a society where 80 per cent of Government revenue is from indirect taxes, every beggar on the street contributes to State funded education from Grade I to the final year at university. �It is also wrong to say, that there is no fee levying in Government schools. There is still the provision to levy school fees as �Facilities Fees� in Government schools.� �In most schools, especially in rural areas, it is not done for the convenience of teachers. There is also provision for Principals to collect funds in all Government schools.� �Most maintenance expenses the State bore in the past have now been gradually transferred to parents. Parents now pay for building repairs. Spend on annual colour washing. Past pupils have taken over expansion needs through fund raising. All parents have to now pay for their children�s after school tuition that is almost mandatory in a thriving private tuition industry.� �What �free� education are these anarchist protests trying to save by closing SAITM? �There is nothing �free� even at the Open University of Sri Lanka maintained on public funds.� ��		Clearly a political campaign the tax payers are indirectly funding			Calculations made last year with the Government allocating Rs.163 bn for higher education and Rs.77 bn for education, showed that every adult citizen pay around Rs.16,000 annually for education			Closing down of the SAITM will have absolutely no relevance to whatever is meant by �free education� �			A student protest, with GMOA leadership against SAITM, has nothing to do with improving the quality of medical education and its profession.� �			The cost of education is either borne by parents privately or paid for by the citizens through direct and indirect taxes.	Most State universities have fee levying certificate, diploma and degree courses going un-opposed by these �free education� saviours.� �International schools, registered as private companies have become part of national education with unregulated fee levying. From pre-school to higher education, parents spend a fair percentage of their hard earned income on education of their children in what these anarchist protesters call a �free education� system. �This is plain opportunist politics played out without direct participation of the Parliamentary Joint Opposition.� �With this Government�s impotence in taking decisions and implementing them quick and firm, these protests have gathered momentum with half hearted solutions offered, but rejected without any serious negotiations. Every round of protests has thus been turned more violent than the previous protest. Worst is that people tolerate all this with just a grumble. �The unseen and unaccounted for damage for the tax-paying public is colossal.� �What use of the tax payers money spent on universities during the past half year? All the lost days in university education, does not go without cost. What cost was it for the citizens who paid for education? While these undergrads were on the streets violently trespassing on State land, blocking traffic, inconveniencing the public, every citizen of this country was paying to keep universities open, paying the salaries of all academic and non-academic staff.� �The undergrads were paid their Mahapola Scholarship to go on these meaningless protests. �Tax-paying citizens, don�t also realise they have been paying for all the facilities added to salaries, allowances and overtime (The biggest farce on earth) of medical doctors while they were on strike demanding closure of SAITM that has nothing to do with healthcare in this country. ��It is a bloated lie to say allowing SAITM medical graduates would deteriorate the quality of medical doctors. It is already very much so, with most medical faculties in State universities providing medical degrees with wholly inadequate academic staff and poor facilities.� �Their quality is rarely tested with patient backwardness that does not challenge them. Often reported cases of medical neglect and faulty diagnosis resulting in fatalities though not challenged, prove medical doctors from State medical faculties are not always the best, nor even good.� �Even where complaints are made to the SLMC against medical doctors, it is a case of medical doctors investigating and sitting on judgment over their colleagues. �Student protests, with GMOA leadership against SAITM, have nothing to do with improving the quality of medical education and its profession.� �The medical profession is no more a respectable, noble profession, chasing after big money without ethics and morals.� �It has in turn lost its due social respect. SAITM is also not about saving �free education�.� �Closing of SAITM will not stop the already �commodified� education to be anything different. �This clearly is a political campaign the tax payers are indirectly funding and will not stand to gain anything from, except growing anarchy. �This will therefore continue until the Government realises it cannot afford this anarchy anymore and the people realise they should not allow their tax money to go waste on these anarchist protests.�",dengue

Dr. Senaratne in an interview with our sister paper Lankadeepa goes on to state that the discussion held was of a secret nature and such a discussion has only aggravated the complex nature of the SAITM issue. The following are excerpts of the interview.��There had been a meeting between the GMOA and President Maithripala Sirisena with regard to the SAITM issue. Doctors have confirmed having had this meeting. A separate letter has been sent by The President�s Secretary after the meeting regarding this issue. You say there has been no such official meeting with them. Who is saying the truth? �The President says there was an unofficial meeting with them (GMOA). He (President) immediately stated that this meeting had been a secret one. The president has given GMOA officials an opportunity to meet him following a request by them. President never gave them an appointment. They (GMOA) said if an appointment was given for a discussion they would stop the strike. Following their request they were asked to come. There are no records of this meeting. No photos. If there was an official discussion, ask them to show photos. They also accepted that this was a secret meeting. There is no any indication in the letter sent by the President Office that such a discussion was held. The GMOA had tried to have a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, but he (Premier) hadn�t allocated them a time. That is why a telephone call has been taken to Dr. Malik Samarawickrama instead of Minister Malik Samarawickrama.Given the complex nature of the problem it is strange that a secret meeting was held. Don�t you think such a meeting will only aggravate the issue? �We have to offer some help when doctors request a favour for their meeting held in the afternoon. They have to tell something to their members. There are many JVP and Peratugami Party members representing this union. We had to do something because we didn�t want the doctors to lose power in this union.But GMOA says that you were involved when the discussion was in progress with the President and the GMOA. Is it true that you aired your personal views at this forum? �Why should I intervene in this matter? I wasn�t there. Who is interested in my personal views? All ideas have been presented by the government. They say that this government is functioning according to the wishes of some individuals. The government has showcased its stability.

But what is happening is that both parties are doing tit for tat �Why should we take a step back? Did we create SAITM? It�s they who got together and built this institute. Now Padeniya is having discussions with Gotabaya Rajapaksha. According to MP Paranawithana, it is Padeniya who took Champika Ranawaka to meet Gotabaya when he (Champika) left the previous government. Now we have to decide whether we will do away with the SAITM or not.� �The GMOA says that due to the lack of flexibility regarding this SAITM issue, some day students might become more aggressive and take up weapons? �There is a separate investigation being done by the CID. There is a newly passed act which spells how to deal with people circulating rumors that can cause turmoil in the country. Such culprits will have to undergo a 10-year imprisonment. This is also not a bailable offence.�""The Ministry of Health can�t stop the increase of Dengue. The Ministry of Health can cure Dengue patients""�Then what is the clear stance and decision taken by the government in this regard? �The stance taken by the Cabinet of ministers is clear and has been conveyed.Champika and Dayasiri are against SAITM despite the Cabinet of Ministers having decided about the future of this institute. Does this indicate that the government is split on this issue?� �They didn�t say anything regarding SAITM at the Cabinet meeting. Something has to be said in this regard for comments to be made public. It is Minister Champika who said not to hold any more meetings with the GMOA.� �You are also a doctor. You are fighting against the doctors. Will these clashes effect your profession? �Only the doctors are clashing with me. Others are supporting me. Did you see that numbers representing unions that gathered around the ministry premises?� �You have said that only three or four members have offered opposition and that the others are with you. Then why can�t you settle this problem? �True. There are many members. They were present even on 8th of January, 2015. They are threatened by the GMOA which now operates like a mafia. It�s they (GMOA) which does the transfers and appointments according to their wishes. I will put a complete stop to it.� �Can four or five people initiate a in the hospital? �The union meetings are attended only a few people. As much as 98% will not participate. As a result ultimate decisions are taken by only a few people. We have a tradition of agreeing with these decisions. Now the majority of the members have understood that this is all political work. Now they (the majority) are organizing unions in every province with the view of airing a different voice. I am the person who stopped that. Now I understand that the majority will go separately given the prevailing situation.� ��""An issue regarding quality has never arisen during my tenure in office. Now it is OK. I should be thanked""�Your detractors claim that you are in favour SAITM because of your daughter in law?� ��Not only my daughter in law. There are other relations in this institute too. Anura Kumara Dissanayake�s son is also in the SLIT. The sister of Lahiru from Antaray also there. Given this background what can we do? �Now you have no problem. But you had a problem when the first private medical college commenced. Is this correct? �My cousin brother was enrolled there during that time. I protested against that. I highlighted only two facts. One is not to recruit unqualified persons. The second is not to have the degree on par with Colombo. We had no problem regarding private medical colleges. We are trying to correct them.� �Their problem is about the quality of the degree. The absence of justice with regard to this has given rise to a problem.� �We accept the issue regarding quality. They broke into the ministry on the day we wanted to offer the quality certificate. The Medical Council was to give me the quality certificate on that day. An issue regarding quality has never arisen during my tenure in office. Now it is OK. I should be thanked.� �Now people say SAITM should be acquired. But the government has acquired the Nevil Fernando Hospital. What is the use of acquiring a white elephant? �They say various things. Earlier they said they are fighting to ensure quality. Now they say we must abolish SAITM. They knew that we will ensure quality. Investors won�t come to the country if things are happening in this manner. Premadasa did a foolish thing. GMOA and Dentist Unions didn�t make a request to nationalize Medical College. It was the JVP that made this request. Premadasa had a personal grudge with the private doctor of J.R.Jayewardene. This was because the doctor didn�t acknowledge Premadasa�s presence. As a result, Premadasa acquired the Medical College. At present the second such institute is going to be nationalized. Will investors come to the country now? Then what will happen is that students will go abroad. As a result our money will also go abroad. Is that correct now? No one is talking ill about this aspect of the problem. �Now Nevil Fernando has also opposed your decision. He says that the hospital cannot be acquired? �Will this man agree to our proposals? But we are a government. When we take decisions we can�t please everybody.����""Only the doctors are clashing with me. Others are supporting me. ""�During the recent commotion that took place, university students were assaulted and government property was severely damaged. You could have stopped their arrival?I was worried about properties and government servants. It was only after I informed about the incident that the top brass police officials came to know about this. If a protest is staged by the university students, the first thing the police should do is to go either to the Ministry of Higher Education, my Ministry, President�s Office or Prime Minister�s Office. What the police did was arrive and passively watch. That is all. Police didn�t do anything till the Colombo DIG came. The police hadn�t taken any steps to prevent the students from breaking the iron gates.� Protecting property is the duty of the police. This could have been stopped on the orders of the STF Commandant. I did this after consulting Sagala. I thank the entire staff of the ministry as they didn�t abandon the ministry at any given time. Some thugs who were present assaulted people, not even sparing fathers.� �Those present were university students. They came there with the view of finding solutions to SAITM. But your people developed the situation into a fight. �Medical students didn�t do this work. Only two or three students would have been involved. How many monks were at the scene? Are they from from Medical College? Students in other faculties were shouting. We understand their intentions as well.� �If we talk about politics, why can�t they go back on the promise which was given by the constitution? �All along constitutions were formed without the mandate of the people. This is the first time we are going to do this. Committees appointed to form constitutions went to various places and took the opinion of the people. It will take more time to change this constitution. We are not taking these decisions forcibly. Even Sampanthan has said no devolution of power can be made without the approval of the Sinhala People. ��""The police hadn�t taken any steps to prevent the students from breaking the iron gates. Protecting property is the duty of the police""�The Sri Lanka Freedom Party opposed some of the proposals in the constitutional committee. Do you think this will� have a negative impact when the constitution needs approving? �Various ideas surface because there are lots of people. Clashes also arise. That is the nature. Most of them say it is like a pot of conjee (herbal porridge). But we will reach our targets.� �The Executive premiership was proposed suddenly. Why is that?� �No. Various ideas were proposed. Some wanted to abolish the executive. Some said to reduce power. There were many proposals. All should come under the Prime Minister. This is the main target. �It is reported that the dengue menace developed during your tenure in office. Isn�t the responsibility yours?.The Malaria menace was completely suppressed during my tenure in office, hence credit should come to me. It is very difficult to control these things within one or two years. Such diseases increase not only in Sri Lanka, but in other countries as well. The reason behind this disease is unnatural weather. This is not Malaria. Suppression of Malaria belongs to the Ministry of Health. But these mosquitoes are living in houses. Malaria has increased in difficult areas. Dengue has increased in urban areas. That is the difference between these two menaces. The Ministry of Health can�t stop the increase of Dengue. The Ministry of Health can cure Dengue patients. Last year we lost 1% and this year it came down to 0.3%. ��""All along constitutions were formed without the mandate of the people. This is the first time we are going to do this. ""�You will be angered when we raise this question. Your activities are similar to the previous Government. You shout more as a person. You are the person who sticks your neck in all government problems? �I don�t know about that. Yes I have stuck my neck in problems faced by every government. I am talking on behalf of leaders. I am talking on behalf of governments too. I do things keeping in mind my own theme. I�m not airing views outside of the Cabinet. I present my theme to the Cabinet. Some people don�t like this. I always protect the government. We must always see who istalking against the government and who is coming to power next if the government fails.That won�t be the JVP. We know Rajapakshas are coming to power. Why should we appoint the Rajapakshas again? �Is it because of your straightforwardness that you have not allowed the secretary appointed by the president� to assume the duties?� �That issue wasn�t regarding that Secretary. That secretary is scheduled to retire in February next year. As a result he gets his leave from November. It is very difficult to run the Ministry of Health like this. That is why I said to appoint a secretary who has at least one more year to serve in the Ministry.���",dengue

SAITM President wants all ministers to unite,"2017-07-06 01:35:48							0						 				2239","The government faced intense heat from those protesting private medical education in the country. The Government Medical Officers� Association (GMOA), backed by university students and their parents, in main, mounted its campaign leaving the ruling side in bewilderment. Street protests, students being teargassed and baton charged and condemnation of the alleged excessive use of force by the police became the order of day, and made headlines in several media. ��It became even uneasy for the govt when some Cabinet Ministers, namely Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara also spoke for the abolition of the South Asia Institute of Medicine and Technology (SAITM). Their call was a shot in the arm for the GMOA and others clamouring for the nationalization of SAITM at any cost. ��On one occasion, Minister Ranawaka even called for a press conference to announce his stand. Minister Jayasekara also echoed similar sentiments to the media on and off. On the contrary, there were many other ministers appearing in support of SAITM. �	Some cabinet ministers lock horns over issues related to SAITM	President dismayed by lackadaisical approach in dealing with corruption cases	If MR wins again, UNP will have no issues. But it would deal a fatal blow to me - Prez	Net the sharks; not the sprats - Prez	GMOA crippled health services leaving patients suffering from dengue in the lurch	Some foreign universities express interests to open branch campuses in SLAt the Cabinet meeting, Ministers Ranawaka, Jaysekara, Navin Dissanayake and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe stood for a non-profitable trustee to run SAITM. Some of them pointed out that SAITM was conducting the degree programme with a huge profit margin. In fact, it was cited as three times higher than the actual cost. Besides, there were others who spoke for a Public Private Partnership model to operate the institute. �It became uneasy for the govt when some Cabinet Ministers, namely Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara spoke for the abolition of SAITM Medicine and Technology (SAITM)Against this backdrop, President Maithripala Sirisena, having felt the pinch, intervened at Tuesday�s Cabinet meeting in this regard, and rebuked the Ministers expressing different views over SAITM. Instead, he stressed the point that all the Ministers should speak with one voice as the common position of the govt about the issue. ��Actually, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Social Empowerment Minister S.B. Dissanayake are the vociferous supporters of SAITM. In the joint Cabinet paper submitted last week by Minister Kirella and Dr. Senaratne, the govt sought to acquire Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital affiliated to SAITM to the govt. Besides, the govt decided to allow SAITM to offer fee-levying degree courses in medicine. Yet, its administration is proposed to be placed under a trustee. ��This, more or less, has become the stand of the government on SAITM though the GMOA and others call for its nationalization, come what may. All in all, the govt ministers, having dissenting views on the private medical institution, are compelled to fall in line with this stance. Be that as it may, the anti-SAITM lobby is not ready to settle for something less�than nationalization. ��The GMOA flexed its muscles on the govt striking work on numerous occasions. The GMOA crippled the health service leaving patients in the lurch at a time when Dengue, the deadly viral epidemic is taking its toll in the country. ��It is clear that the govt is not ready for the acquisition of SAITM. Also, the GMOA has not spelt out clearly whether it would strike a compromise of its position with the govt. ��As nationalization is not the option contemplated by the govt in resolving this issue, there is still the possibility of the two sides locking horns sooner or later. In fact, the GMOA planned for the relaunch to continue strike action this week. Yet, it withheld the move for one week upon request by the Mahanayake Theras and the Cardinal. University students continue to protest in terms of constant demonstrations, boycott of lectures etc. ��The govt is in a state of confusion on this matter. The registration of MBBS graduates, passing out from SAITM, is now a matter pending with the Supreme Court to rule on. The govt awaits it. The ruling would have a bearing on the implementation of the govt�s policy on private investment in higher education. It has sought private sector involvement in the development of higher education. Already, a few foreign universities have expressed interests in putting up their branch campuses in Sri Lanka. It is learnt that these universities await the ruling by the Supreme Court on SAITM degree to decide on investment in Sri Lanka. Manipal University of India is one such foreign entity that sought to establish its branch in Sri Lanka. A plot of land has also been identified for the project in the Bandaragama area in the Kalutara district. However, the Indian authorities have instructed the university to wait for some time till the court ruling is delivered. Again, SAITM has become a turning point for the govt in shaping its future policy on higher education. ��Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Social Empowerment Minister S.B. Dissanayake are the vociferous supporters of SAITMPresident expresses disappointment on the performance of Anti-Corruption Secretariat At Tuesday�s Cabinet meeting, President Sirisena expressed his dismay over the failure on the part of the govt to extend the term of the Anti-Corruption Secretariat. He is reported to have said that there is a lackadaisical approach in dealing with cases of corruption. �Striking a strong note of criticism on the performance of this Secretariat, he said he took a grave risk by defecting from the previous rule to contest the presidency at the election in 2015. He noted that he, along with Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and others, would have even faced elimination had �Mahinda Rajapaksa won the presidency for his third term. The President informed the Cabinet that his children would have also faced the same consequence in such a scenario. As such, he queried what the Anti-Corruption Secretariat did against those who planned such insidious things. ��According to the tone and tenor of his remarks, the President seems to fear political victimization in case MR gains upper hand in politics once again. ��In the event of the Rajapaksa group clinching power, he said nothing untoward would befall the United National Party (UNP) or its leadership, but he would face dire consequences. As such, he asked the Cabinet to be mindful of his possible plight in handling the current state of affairs. ���If Mahinda Rajapaksa wins again, the UNP will have no problem. But, it would make a fatal blow to me. It has to be borne in mind,� he reportedly told the Cabinet. �In the event of the Rajapaksa group clinching power, he said nothing untoward would befall the United National Party (UNP) or its leadership, but he would face dire consequencesInstead of netting those involved in mass scale corruption, he said action was taken on minor matters such as State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie using a vehicle and MP Priyankara Jayaratne giving employment to one of his relatives. ��The Secretariat was formed after the new government came in. It directed complaints to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). The complaints were mostly against the members of the previous rule. �There is a perception in the country that anti-corruption investigations have slowed in recent months.

He emphasized that being proactive is key to mitigating fatalities and noted that dengue in Sri Lanka is out of control - evident by the statistics.��As responsible citizens and socially responsible organisations, we need to ask ourselves whether we contribute enough to help eradicate dengue. Everyone needs to be alert and work with the authorities to contain the problem,� he stressed.��We, at Hemas Hospitals, as a responsible healthcare institution, feel the need to play that role,��he added.Dr. Peiris said that the launch of �Dengue Epa� campaign today will have the potential to reach 5.4 million Facebook users in this country. I�m certain that this campaign will be very impactful to change the mindset of our people, to change their behaviour and to take personal responsibility to fight this battle and also to pressurize the regulators, policymakers and administrators of Sri Lanka to be more cautious and mindful of this deadly disease. �The situation is precarious with the number of cases in the last few weeks alone having gone up and the mosquito density also being high. The NDCU of the Health Ministry predicts that the numbers will increase now with the onset of the South-West monsoons. While measures have been taken to urgently test and treat patients in a timely manner, lack of awareness in early detection, wrong self treatments and lack of attention to neighbourhood cleanliness have become matters of serious concern and increase risks of getting the disease.The hospital multi-chain has geared itself to managing the growing numbers of patients. �From antigen testing to closely monitoring clinical signs and preparedness in case of an escalation to dengue hemorrhagic condition, their team of qualified and experienced medical professionals is on hand and fully alert to promptly diagnose and�start treatment.Digital agency, Seven Media Group will partner Hemas Hospitals and host the Facebook page free of charge, as their contribution towards this effort.�Portraying a grim picture, the hospital notes that with the number of cases in the last few weeks alone having gone up, lack of awareness in early detection, wrong self treatments and lack of attention to neighbourhood cleanliness have become matters of serious concern and increase risks of getting�the disease.�",dengue
Attitudes of the educated affect economy of country,"2017-06-29 01:31:15							0						 				2083","Education was taken over by the State by privatization of schools in the name of free education, a political decision, considered a good move to make free education available to all citizens.�A grievous mistake was made by making the medium of education Sinhala Only. Dropping English converted the country into a Third World within a few years. The country is still struggling to get over the backlash. We as Ceylon were economically ahead of all countries in Asia other than Japan at that time. Our neighbour India continued English education and now they have overtaken Sri Lanka in IT and many other fields.�Our English in the past was better than in English Speaking Countries. We have now gone to the extent of suggesting importing teachers of English from India. Sometime ago we had a programme funded by England / Australia to train Teachers to Teach English when current Prime Minister was Minister of Education. ��After the mistake was realized, the same government that took over private schools was compelled to allow private schools. Restriction being placed that GCE examinations be conducted as London General Certification of Education, subjects in English.�Many private schools in the English Medium sprung up all over the country. Some with high quality, some below quality but students sat a common London GCE examination.�Many private schools in the English Medium sprung up all over the country. Some with high quality, some below quality but students sat a common London GCE examination. No private school in Sinhala Medium has started. Parents and Investors realized the value of English Education. All these schools educated students to sit for the London GCE Examination. GCE standards was set by the University of London International Examinations Department. The GCE Sri Lanka standard was set by the Department of Examinations.�Now the opportunity is given to students to sit for the Sri Lanka GCE Examinations in English. Private schools as well as State schools are gradually starting classes for Sri Lanka GCE English Medium. Obstacle being, the lack of Teachers who are able to teach in English as they have been educated in Sinhala. This is one country where State Education is considered superior to Private Education as the demand to enter State schools and State universities is far greater than available capacity. For the good fortune of the students of the country Private Schools as well as Degree awarding Private Colleges affiliated to numerous Colleges / Universities overseas were allowed to be operated in the country. Yet approximately Three to Four Thousand students of affluent parents leave the country each year for higher education to overseas universities of G7 Countries and some to less developed countries who offer recognized degrees affiliated to G7 Universities in high profile professions. Very few of these students come back to paradise. A brain drain of affluent students encouraged by governments in power since 1960. ��Now we come to the debate of Private Medical Education. Should State be the Only Educator and Graduator in Medicine in Sri Lanka? Then all Doctors who have obtained their Medical Degrees oversees, should be disqualified from practicing in Sri Lanka although they have passed the Eligibility Requirement to Practice Medicine ERPM Examination conducted by Government of Sri Lanka as the Degree has not been awarded by Government of Sri Lanka Medical Colleges. Approximately 1000 Foreign Qualified Graduates from Universities outside of Sri Lanka sit ERPM conducted by GoSL. The pass rate is 25 � 30%. The quality of these Foreign Universities is so poor although Government has recognized these Universities as suitable for Medical Degrees. Male Graduates who attend Medical Colleges in countries where Islam is practiced are Not given opportunity to treat females or touch a female during Clinical but they have Graduated as MBBS, passed ERPM and practice medicine in Sri Lanka. There are many who call themselves Doctors in Business and Other Professions as they could not pass ERPM. ��The Kotalawala Defence Academy Medical Faculty although Fee Leaving does not fall in to a Private Degree awarding Medical College as it is owned by the State and the Number of Students are 25 � 30 per batch. This gives them better opportunity to interact with the Faculty. ��A quick fix for the current crisis at the Malabe Private Medical College as well as Medical Colleges to be set up in future would be for Medical Students of all Faculties to sit for the same examination conducted by the State Medical Colleges as done for Sri Lanka GCE OL/AL. ��Immediate action be taken to adjust, curriculum of the Malabe Medical Faculty to be compatible to Defense Academy Medical College as the Teaching Faculty of both colleges are Retired State University Practitioners and Lecturers. ��A cut off mark be set by Government as done for Entrance to State Colleges for Entrance to Private Colleges according to number of seats available in Private Medical Colleges to ensure that students with high marks follow the Degree and Not Duds with Money that are allowed follow the Degree. ��As per GMOA and Students Unions they object to Medical Degree being awarded by the Malabe Medical College stating the degree is not in par with standards. Or is there jealousy that some of the students in Private Medical Education are from International Schools who have had their Education in English and sat for London GCE Advanced Level Examination.Has GMOA or Students Unions specified the standard, or offered a solution other than objecting to the functioning of the Private Medical College and Award of Degree. ��Once the standard is specified by the Government. All Doctors in practice who do not meet this standard must be compelled to meet the specified standard or resign from service. As per GMOA and Students Unions, we cannot have two standards and rules in the same playing field. ��By this method a common MBBS Degree can be awarded by Malabe / Kotalawala and any other Private Medical Colleges to be set up. ��A cut off mark be set by the Govt as done for Entrance to State Colleges for Entrance to Private Colleges according to number of seats available in Private Medical Colleges to ensure that students with high marks follow the Degree and Not Duds with Money�Another big question is, Does Sri Lanka need this many doctors?. ��Approximately 1200 doctors pass out of the medical system each year. If the per capita Doctor / Population ratio is studied. Sri Lanka compares well with the developed world but Doctors are not available in the required rural areas. Most of the MBBS Doctors have not obtained Post Graduate Qualifications and Specialized. Those who have specialized try to concentrate in the big cities where private practice is rampant and educational facilities for their children are available. The poor farmer or those living in rural areas do not have a Doctor for many, many Kms or population ratio. It must be made mandatory for a Doctor qualifying from a rural area, serve the said area for a minimum of five years before being eligible to serve in another area. There should be a good appointment and transfer scheme to ensure Doctors serve at least ten years in rural areas. Government must ensure the facilities in rural hospitals be improved and family accommodation provided in all Rural Hospitals for Doctors and Secondary Staff. Kolambata Kiri Gamata Kakiri is rampant in the Medical Service. The not so well to do have to travel all the way to Colombo and other big cities in the early hours of the morning to receive treatment in General / Base Hospitals. This is highlighted by Media whenever there is a work stoppage by Doctors. ��The wise move would be to improve the facilities of the existing Medical Colleges. Colombo Medical College was ranked amongst the World Best up to about 1970. Set up Research Facilities in Medical Facilities. We have many deceases endemic to Sri Lanka. Research could be done to find solutions for these. We are to import Anti Dengue products from Australia. Our Scientists are doing great in developed countries. Why cannot we do it here. It is quality of the medical service that matters not quantity. There were no work stoppages by the Medical Profession and Medical Students when they were of quality. Medicine was a profession. Now there is no difference between Doctors and Bus Conductors. ��At the rate that Sri Lanka is producing doctors, there will not be capacity to offer internship in Government Hospitals. There will not be vacancies in the Government Medical Service to offer jobs for doctors. If Protests Vs Loss to the economy if calculated, the government could have improved the health services ten fold. Eventually it is the people who suffer not Malabe Medical College, GMOA or Student Union. Students who boycott lectures and their parents need to realize that it is they that suffer the loss and not those who incite boycotts and protests. ��If a serious calculation is done on loss to State, public life, disruption of services to the public, damage to property will run to billions. Can this loss to economy be recovered from those who encourage disruption of services, incite work stoppage, damage property. 99% of the population pay for the loss caused by less than 1% of the population. It is very strange to see Buddhist Priests in the protest march of medical students. These are the persons that should be arrested, charges filed and put in jail. The Most Venerable Mahanayakas will stand by Justice. Our judicial system is so slow, it will be another burden on the public ��Those who are against Private Medical Education will have to give serious thought with respect to loss to the economy. With this low quality of mentality of the educated and to be educated. ��",dengue
DENGUE TURNS DISASTROUS Hospitals suffer from chronic shortage of beds,"2017-06-29 00:40:11							0						 				2603","DENGUE TURNS DISASTROUS Hospitals suffer from chronic shortage of beds2017 year has been the year of the dengue mosquitoes. It has only been halfway through the year, but the number of dengue patients have spiked like never before. The rise in dengue has itself caused another travesty as hospitals are inundated with fever patients. The atmosphere in both state and private hospitals as of late is a very tense one, with hospital staff attempting to cope with and provide medical treatment to all patients despite the challenge of limited ward space and other facilities. The Daily Mirror visited the leading hospitals in Colombo and its suburbs as the district grapples the burden of dengue.�We witnessed suffering patients in almost all hospitals while undaunted medical staff were providing much needed care, despite the setbacks that have sprouted into existence with the dengue menace.��Patients suffer from bed shortageThe National Hospital of Sri Lanka, where dengue patients are being accepted day after day, is also faced with the problem of patients outnumbering availability of beds. Upon visiting the wards with dengue patients, we witnessed beds and corridors packed with patients lying on any available space; be it on the floor, benches, foldable beds and the regular hospital beds. Doctors and nurses were bustling through the narrow corridors looking to the needs of patient after patient. �The Dengue High Dependency Unit (HDU) in Ward 55, has been allocated for dengue patients in need of specialised treatment. The Daily Mirror spoke to many patients who were satisfied with the way the doctors and nurses were treating them, despite the severe shortage of beds.�We further learnt from the Deputy Director General of the hospital that the hospital will continue to manage the influx of patients and are increasing facilities available for the accommodation of dengue patients.We have set up HDUs in all wards-Dr. Anil Jasinghe, the Deputy Director GeneralOn average, the hospital houses 375 dengue patients, out of which, 75 are in the latent stage. �We have identified and set apart some HDUs in all wards. There are 15 wards and 8 beds in each ward which are set aside for HDU patients. That�s 120 beds in total. Out of these 120 beds, 2 beds in each ward are equipped with a monitor, syringe pump etc; it contributes to 30 beds in total. We are in the process of equipping the ward with 2 more beds in order to increase the total number to 60 beds.� �We have bought 25 foldable beds for the floor patients, so that they are comfortable. We have never stopped admitting patients to the hospitalSpeaking of the management and of the staff along with the influx of patients, he said, �We have a dedicated nurse for each ward who is trained in dengue care. The doctors too have been trained in dengue protocol management.��We have bought 25 foldable beds for the floor patients, so that they are comfortable. We have never stopped admitting patients to the hospital. The consultants discharge the patients when their platelet count goes up. We admit the patients who have the need to be admitted. We have facilities to evaluate each patient before admission. The full blood count tests take 30 minutes to produce results. If the platelet count is not low, then patients could always come back to test themselves.� �In his message to the public in order to avoid the disease progressing into intense stage, �If they are running a fever, by the third day, they should get a medical check up and start on proper treatment. We see when the children or the elderly fall sick they are taken care of from the beginning and precautions are taken. However when it comes to the working people, they neglect their condition take a paracetamol and continue working. What people need to know is, if by the third day the fever does not subside, they should undergo a medical check up.��We were tested regularly�I have been here for 2 days. Some of the patients don�t have enough beds here but the doctors and hospital staff are taking good care of us. They are all very considerate. They conduct checks whenever they are required and administer relevant medicine. The nurses visit us regularly and check on us for four to five times a day. They take our blood samples and the doctors do the tests. All in all, I am satisfied with the treatment I am getting here.� ����willing to wait�I was admitted yesterday, I have been on this bench from that time. They are looking into me regularly and the doctors are checking on me. Even if I haven�t been given a bed I wouldn�t want them to remove someone on a bed just because I want a bed, everyone needs one, I have to wait for my turn. I am satisfied with the way they are treating me.�����I was given a bed�They are treating us properly and looking after us regularly. I have been here for 4 days; I was transferred from another ward to here. We are checked on around 4 to 5 times a day. The doctor visits me regularly. I was given a bed since the time I was sent to this ward.����Commendable service by IDHWhen Daily Mirror spoke to a few patients who were fresh from being discharged from the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH), they readily expressed their views concerning the current situation of the hospital. While noting that there was a great influx in the number of patients being admitted to the hospital, they also appreciated the outstanding service of the hospital staff. They said that the staff were maintaining stringent standards with regard to the proper management of the hospital; this is in addition to handling of the situation professionally with good medical expertise. The following are comments from the patients:��Hospital environment is very clean��Currently there is a very big crowd in terms of hospital inmates at the IDH. At least two patients are being accommodated in one bed. However, the patients are being treated with good care and the nurses are very hospitable and kind towards the patients. The hospital environment is also very clean and the treatment is excellent. I believe that the IDH is far better than the other hospitals for treating children�.����No shortcomings in medical treatment��Despite the large number of patients that are getting admitted to the hospital, we have not witnessed any kind of shortcomings in the medical treatment that we receive. We have never been asked to get our blood count tested from any private clinics. All blood tests are done within the hospital premises. I was receiving treatment here for seven days, and today, I was discharged. I am very happy with the treatment�.����Medical professionals are doing their best���There are at least two or three patients sharing one bed. It has been three days since my eldest son�s daughter was admitted to the hospital. She has still not fully recovered from the illness. However, the medical professionals are doing everything within their capacity in terms of treatment. Also, it is quite relieving that blood and urine tests are conducted within the hospital premises itself �.���Treatment methodical despite crowds��Despite being overcrowded, the medical treatment administered to patients is very good and methodical. Blood tests and urine tests are also conducted within the hospital premises as and when needed, without any hassle. My wife was discharged today after being admitted for two days at the hospital�.����Eradication of dengue must be carried out effectivelyAlthough patients are being accommodated in separate wards depending on their illnesses, we noticed that most beds are shared by two to three patients. The medical service is excellent and patients are being monitored on hourly basis. My husband was admitted to the hospital day before yesterday and he is still receiving treatment for dengue. I strongly believe that the root causes for the spread of dengue should be addressed by relevant authorities in an effective manner. We could have minimized the threat of dengue if drainages, canals and the surrounding environment were effectively cleaned.�Patient attention highly commendable�The Daily Mirror visited the wards of the Kalubowila Colombo South Teaching Hospital scoping out the dengue challenge at the hospital. It was indeed a very hectic environment with throngs of fever patients admitted to the wards while many more remained seated outside awaiting admission. Among the fever patients, there were confirmed dengue cases as well as suspected dengue cases waiting for their medical reports. It was quite clear that the ward facilities were running out with respect to the increasing number of patients.�But despite all difficulties, the hospital staff seems to be managing the chaotic hassle giving priority to the dengue patients though it indeed appears a very tedious task.Planning to streamline OPD admission�Kalubowila Hospital Director Dr. Asela Gunawardana��We have 340 dengue patients admitted to the hospital at present. A rise in patients are expected if the rains continue. We are planning to streamline OPD admission by encouraging people to stay at home and get bed rest unless the condition is critical. The admission condition is the platelet count is below 130,000 to minimize influx of patients. Amidst other measures, we are hoping to allocate free beds in 2 post-natal wards for patients recovering after a critical condition of dengue. This will make more room for acute dengue patients.�Hoping to allocate free beds in 2 post-natal wards for patients recovering after a critical condition of dengue. This will make more room for acute dengue patientsBeds outnumber patientsRathna Moratugoda, a grandmother who had come to get her granddaughter discharged also spoke about the dedication of the hospital staff. The ward where her granddaughter was receiving treatment had 40 beds which were outnumbered with over a 100 patients where 60-70 of the patients were suffering from dengue. �My granddaughter was in haemorrhagic state when she was admitted, but thanks to treatment she is out of danger now and getting discharged today.���There is no time to restLiyanage, a nursing sister at one of the female medical wards said, �Our ward has 46 beds. Just this morning, the admission of patients rose to 115 to that ward. Among these patients, 48 are suffering from dengue and are under intense monitoring. Other patients have been admitted upon suspicion of dengue. Eight nurses are assigned for day duty, while five handle the night shift. There is no time to rest. However, we stick to strict monitoring and give priority to the dengue patients.� �However, the difficulties faced are not one-sided just to the hospital staff, but despite facility issues, the patients seem to be happy with the treatment that they are receiving.Overcrowded wardsPatients at the Colombo North Teaching Hospital in Ragama revealed that the hospital has been carrying out all tests, including full blood counts. Except for a few cases, all patients in ward 9, had been admitted immediately while there were also a patients suspected with dengue. The ward housed 42 dengue patients with eight other patients who are at the dengue haemorrhagic stage. More than three patients were on the floor, due to shortage of beds in the ward.�We were also informed of several unconfirmed patients. During our time of visits, beds were placed in corridors which were being prepared for new admissions.�Seek admission if platelet count is below 130,000��Dr. Vajira Dissanayaka��Deputy Director - Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Ragama��There were around 243 dengue patients by Monday with 98 cases with internal bleeding. Dengue patients are admitted to seven medical emergency wards plus three paediatric wards. A ward is usually equipped with 42 beds but since it is an emergency situation we cannot exactly state the number of beds.� ��Commenting on the number of the admissions, Dr. Dissanayaka said �Dengue cases are increasing when compared to last month. The daily admissions last month ranged between 150 - 200 but now it is 250 - 300.� �Dr. Dissanayaka has also advised those suspected to have been infected with dengue to admit themselves at the hospital as soon as possible. She said patients should stay at least two days in the hospital to confirm whether they have dengue. If the platelet count is below 130,000, we strongly advise to seek medical attention immediately, and if it is above 160,000, it is advisable to rest at home.� ��Dengue cases are increasing when compared to last month. The daily admissions last month ranged between 150 - 200 but now it is 250 - 300forced to share beds�I have been here for a week, but only received a bed after waiting for more than a day. Until then I was seated in a chair. There were some patients on the floor, even on the pavement. The patients have been sharing spaces together due to the lack of beds. Critical and undiagnosed patients are also there.������Doctors have been very attentive and all the tests were done by the hospital staff. The only problem here is the lack of space. I was in the ward for four days and I was sharing a bed with another.� There are untrained janitors and wash rooms are not clean all the time.�����A dengue haemorrhage patient who had checked his blood platelet count from a private channelling centre, was admitted to the hospital after waiting for 48 hours. He was given the corner most bed which was made by assembling three beds, he has to share it with four others. He had a bed of his own, which was after an unfortunate death of another patient.���benched for treatmentBoth were on the corridor of ward No. 9 seated on the bench. He said that the corridors are congested at night, as the admissions are high during the night. Cyril was suffering from an invading germ, while Jude was admitted with a chest pain. Chathura Madhushanka who was not diagnosed with dengue at the time of our visit, was also advised to rest on the bench on the corridor, in order for him to receive treatment if necessary.���I was admitted when the platelet count was around 91�, said Roshantha. He was also a patient sharing the corner most combined bed. Nishanka, in the adjoining bed had been in the hospital for four days and his platelet count decreased to 36.��Admission temporarily suspended on four occasions�The Jayawardenapura Hospital made headlines over the past few days as reports emerged that the hospital had temporarily suspended the admission of fever patients. As we entered the hospital, a notice at the entrance read suggesting the same. However speaking to the Daily Mirror, the Deputy Director of the hospital Dr. Santhusha Fernando said that the hospital is well equipped �and is familiar in managing the epidemic.�Deputy Director, Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital in her comments:With the influx of patients, the rate of admission is very high, as there is a very high incidence of dengue in the Colombo district. Most people are very aware of the situation nowadays. The moment they suspect dengue, they get themselves tested from outside by a General Physician or by themselves. They demand for admission as they are scared of the disease. There is a concurrent flu epidemic as well. ��Clarifying the controversy surrounding admissions, Dr. Fernando said the hospital functions in a methodical manner to ensure the best care for patients. �At our hospital, even if a patient is discharged we need a bit of time to settle their records because this is a fee levying hospital. We need time to write their diagnosis cards, to give them advice and to get them down from the bed. We also need time to sanitise the beds and prepare for the next patient as we have to adhere to the standards of hygiene�. ���When we are inundated with patients, we can�t cope with these processes. So from time to time, according to the bed availability we have been forced to shut down the hospital for a few hours, to get our bed management in order. But we have never closed down the hospital as it has happened in some other government hospitals,� she said. ���The hospital was temporarily closed for admissions only on four occasions; for a few hours. The closure was not for more than four hours. There has been information circulating that so many patients were turned away. Those were the result of patients being agitated when they were turned away or asked to wait for two or three hours�. ��Asked if the beds are sufficient to house patients, the Deputy Director said the hospital is equipped with approximately 1080 beds. �The usual standard of a hospital at any given point, we expect the best saturation of beds to be 80 percent of the total number of beds. About 15 to 20 percent of beds in any hospital should be kept vacant in the case of a disaster or accident. We do have beds but we cannot adhere to standards of bed management with the influx of patients. We can manage and we are geared to manage this situation. But due to the public response to fever we are faced with a delay and difficulty in managing the beds. The situation is not as bad as it has been portrayed. We have increased the number of day beds at our Emergency Treatment Unit (ETU) where patients with dengue can wait for their blood count�.We rationally decide if the patient can be sent home and ask them to return the next day�With our clinical judgment we rationally decide if the patient can be sent home and ask them to return the next day if they are from the vicinity. If they are residents of faraway places we still admit such patients. The hospital has dedicated three medical wards headed by three consultants and staff of varied expertise, with 10 to 12 medical staff attending to each ward. Wards dedicated for other illnesses are also cooperating with dengue management and are offering a percentage of their wards to house dengue patients, depending on the requirement. We have provided dengue training to doctors in the outlier wards, refreshing their skills and knowledge on dengue management,� Dr. Fernando opined. ��The Jayawardenapura Hospital is geared to face challenges the Deputy Director said citing the staff�s experience in managing patients. �During the time of the war, we had a high influx of military casualties, so we were used to very intense workloads and coordination between our wards. Our laboratory staff and radiology staff have been providing a dedicated service, as dengue patients have to undergo frequent tests and scans, I can confidently say that our hospital is well geared to manage the situation�.��Patient admission ranges from 250 - 300 a day��- Dr. K.V.C. Janaka��Emergency Treatment Unit,�J�pura HospitalDr. K.V.C. Janaka who has been on the front-line of dealing with the heavy influx of dengue patients at the Jayawardenapura hospital admits that the number of dengue patients has put medical services under strain. �We have a huge influx of patients this year. On Tuesday evening, there were 135 suspected dengue patients coming in. The total number of for a day ranges from 250 to 300 patients whereas the hospital has about 1000 beds. Therefore we find it difficult to cope with the situation.� ���We have been adhering to the national guidelines and have only been admitting patients with a platelet count below 150,000 depending on our clinical judgment. We have to select the patients who are really in need of hospital care and we can�t admit all patients for nursing care.� ��We are now grappling with practical issues in treating patients�Colombo district obviously has the highest burden but the death rates at our hospital have been below the national level. The dengue virus type 2 is a new strain to our population. Therefore a large number of people have been presenting with symptoms. The previous types of dengue saw a certain degree of resistance. But the changes in the weather pattern may have caused this epidemic. The number of dengue cases are very high this year and we expect it to rise by July.� ���We are now grappling with practical issues in treating patients as our staff has to take hourly measurements from about 40 patients in a ward. Our staff can handle the situation but they are under immense stress when the numbers are this high.� ���",dengue

Volunteers from Coca-Cola were active in the medical camps and in delivering water to affected families and individuals, as additional operational support on the ground in the week after the floods were of great need.��The Company ensured that distribution of over 10,000 litres of water was executed through deliveries on-foot, by trucks and by boat, to access areas isolated by the remaining flood waters. Medical camps, Mobile camps and First Aid services were conducted through 16 service events providing access for essential healthcare to 2,129 affected individuals in the first week after the flooding began. Coca-Cola is grateful to the critical support offered by Sri Lanka Red Cross Society - �Gampaha Branch, the Grama Niladharis and the Public Health Inspectors of the Ministry of Health.��Medical Officer of Health, Biyagama, Mrs Kumari Wijesuriya said, �The recent floods in Sri Lanka caused devastating loss to life and property, leaving many communities helpless. Many areas in Biyagama were particularly badly affected and residents here needed all the possible relief and rehabilitation assistance. As a state body, we are offering every possible support to this community, however, Coca-Cola�s support at this crucial time has helped ease our stretched resources. I am grateful for the company�s generous support in well-cleaning activities in Biyagama, which will go a long way in supplying clean drinking water to these communities as they slowly limp back to normalcy.��In their return to their daily lives, it was working around the issue of contaminated household wells which prevented homeowners from returning to normalcy.The well-cleaning process involves the cleaning, disinfection and chlorination by professionals from Sri Lanka Red Cross Gampaha Branch. Homeowners in need were identified from the information provided by the Divisional Secretariat and requests by the Grama Niladharis of each division. In all 8 Grama Niladhari divisions, certification for each homeowner was done by the Public Health Inspectors and or Grama Niladharis, Once the process was completed, a sticker was pasted identifying the water from the cleaned wells were safe for drinking, bathing and other day-to-day activities.�Commenting on Coca-Cola�s flood relief operations, Mayank Arora, Managing Director of Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd said, �Coca-Cola responded to the recent floods by providing those affected with access to water and medical camps. More importantly, as a company we are privileged to support the long-term wellbeing of the community by further ensuring access to safe, clean water by undertaking the responsibility to clean 600 wells within the local community of Biyagama. As a Company that operates on the principle of sustainable communities, communities can depend on Coca-Cola to offer tangible support in their time of need.��",dengue

With the dengue fever spreading to an unprecedented proportion claiming over 200 lives and threatening at least another 63,000, only for the last five and a half months in this year. Opposition parties, especially the Joint Opposition have renewed their agitation calling for the local government elections throughout the country. �They argue that disposal of garbage around the country has been crippled as there are no elected people�s representatives in municipal councils, urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas after their term lapsed, leaving the administration of those bodies purely in the hands of the bureaucracy that works mainly upon orders. ��They were agitating for the holding of these elections for these local bodies since last year accusing the government for not holding the said elections for fear of defeat in light of their failure in keeping the promises given to the people during the last Presidential and Parliamentary election. Although their claim that the government fears to face the voters seemed first as a usual political vituperation, the government�s behaviour during the past one year seems to have given credence to it. �The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has also joined the Joint Opposition�s bandwagon this week. Entering into a political debate, the GMOA spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said on Tuesday that the solid waste management issues have erupted following the local government bodies were crippled, resulting in the current dengue epidemic situation in the country. It is well known that the powerful trade union of government doctors is in a collision course with the present government over the proposed ETCA agreement with India and especially over the government�s refusal to close down the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) or the Malabe private medical college.�There are 335 local government authorities in Sri Lanka which include 23 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 271 Pradeshiya Sabhas. Elections were held only for 330 local government bodies in 2006, but later another five new local authorities were created.

However, an Act was passed in 2012 to change the electoral system from the Proportional Representation (PR) system to a mixed system of PR and first-past-the-post systems. The new system created a snag in holding elections in 2015, as wards had to be demarcated in areas under each local government body, under the new mixed system. �A National Delimitation Committee for the demarcation of wards was thus appointed in December 2012. Nevertheless, in terms of the enactment of that Act and an amendment Act adopted in the same year, the then Local Government Minister could opt to continue to have the old electoral system (PR system) in place, until the conclusion of the delimitation process. �However, prior to the conclusion of the delimitation process, the then Local Government Minister A. L. M. Athaullah published a Gazette Notification on January 1, 2013, which said that the provisions of the aforesaid amending Acts had come into operation fully and the previous electoral system has become defunct. �The report of the National Delimitation Committee which was appointed by the previous government under the Chairmanship of Jayalath Ravi Dissanayake, a SLAS officer was submitted to the Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister of the new government Faizser Musthapha on June 19, 2015. However, consequent to the publication of it, the ministry had received over 1,000 complaints claiming that the delimitation process was flawed. ���It is well known that the powerful trade union of government doctors is in a collision course with the present government over the proposed ETCA agreement with India�Accordingly, a Cabinet sub- committee was appointed to look into the discrepancies in the demarcations of ward boundaries made by the Jayalath Dissanayake committee, followed by the Asoka Peiris committee in October 2015 for the same purpose. An all party conference was also held with the participation of the President and the Prime Minister with regard to the said issue. �Asoka Peiris committee had completed its task within three months and Peiris had been quoted by the Sunday Times on January 3, 2016 as expressing confidence that he could hand over the final report of the committee by the January 31 deadline. However, it was postponed and the Government Information Department said on June 22, 2016 that the Report is expected to be handed over on August 31 which was also not happened. �Again on December 26 Peiris had stated to the media that his report would be handed over to Minister Musthapha on the next day but again the Musthapha�s Ministry said the release of the report had been delayed owing to some administrative issues. ��In an interview with the Sunday Lankadeepa of January 1, this year Peiris had dropped a bombshell by saying that the Minister was asking him to drag on with the report and both the main political parties were keen to delay the report. He also alleged that the ministry was not providing adequate translators as well. ��The Minister had denied the allegations in an interview with the same paper in its next issue. Before that he had retaliated by refusing to accept the report from Peiris publicly at a media conference on January 2, the very next day Peiris�s accusation had been published, on the grounds that all five members had not signed it. ��Interestingly, the report had not then been signed by the representatives of the two main parties, including the minister�s party UPFA which were accused by Peiris for wanting to drag on.

Dengue Dengue Everywhere,"2017-06-22 01:55:38							1						 				1902","With over a whopping 67, 205 cases and some 200 deaths being reported countrywide, the Dengue menace has reached new heights. With June being the peak month to inflict the malady on innocent lives, efforts to eradicate the disease has intensified further. As the number of patients being hospitalised is on the rise, the Health Ministry and relevant authorities remain perplexed on how best to address the growing epidemic which has topped the list as one of the major national crises. ��According to a recent statement by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the ministry is currently studying the possibility of importing �Wolbachia� -- a newly-developed bacterium for Dengue control -- from Australia. It is believed that the bacterium combats the virus from replicating inside the mosquitoes, and that by getting Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to mate and pass the bacterium to future generations, the cases of Dengue will diminish. Thus, given the fact that this plan works out, it could be surmised that mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia would fail to transmit the Dengue. ��Speaking to the�Daily Mirror, several officials from the health sector explained the gravity of the situation whilst shedding light upon the baffling question: �why has the number of Dengue cases increased steeply in Sri Lanka during the recent past?� While underscoring the need for constructive engagement to battle this menace, they stressed the need to raise more awareness among the general public on this concern. ����With Dengue patients spiking up in the monsoon season, more and more lives are being threatened every day. This increase is inevitable. Hospitals are flooding with Dengue patients, and what lies ahead is the challenge of reducing the number of deaths caused from this disease. ���The number of Dengue patients being hospitalised keeps increasing on a daily basis. Despite limited facilities, relevant authorities travel that extra mile to nurse and recuperate these patients. With the onset of the monsoon season, the number of Dengue patients augmented as anticipated. Our main aim right now is to reduce the number of deaths caused by Dengue.� ��Against this backdrop props the question about Dextran 40, a drug used to treat Dengue patients, which might be running out of stock. ��Dr. Hasitha assured that there were sufficient stocks at the moment, and that steps were being taken to ensure that there would be no shortage in future whatsoever. ���Currently, the drugs for Dengue are not in short supply. But we have made plans to ensure that necessary drugs will be available in future. We have to depend on the international supplier,� Dr. Hasitha said. ���Despite limited facilities, relevant authorities travel that extra mile to nurse and recuperate these patients�However, with Dengue posing a serious threat to the lives of the people, the public is strictly advised to identify and eliminate Dengue breeding grounds in their surroundings. Dr. Hasitha advises patients to get a full blood count on the first sign of fever. ���Drugs for Dengue are not in short supply. But we have made plans to ensure that necessary drugs will be available in future���Seek medical attention on the contraction of fever as early as possible with a full blood count on time is of essence. Never resort to self-medication. Generally, painkillers and unprescribed drugs are not treatment for fever and should be avoided at any cost. On such occasions, patients could face serious hygienic complications including bleeding. Even on receiving medication, a patient should be aware if he or she has been prescribed painkillers and should avoid taking such drugs. It is just as important for the general public to stay vigilant and destroy mosquito breeding grounds. This should not be an isolated effort. Each and every individual in the country has to take the responsibility and act to control the Dengue menace.� ���Hospital facilities available for patients are on verging limits with Dengue raising its ugly head in the most abrupt way this year. According to Professor Arjuna, despite concerns over a dearth of accommodation, Dengue patients are being treated as usual. ���Dengue has risen like we have never seen before. The �Type 2� Dengue virus is to also take the blame for this drastic rise��Facilities at the Ragama Hospital are limited with respect to the number of Dengue patients. Although it is difficult, we are managing our patients. It is a struggle. Extended hospital facilities are the need of the hour. We do not require ventilators or more ICUs. What we need in particular are more high dependency units (HDUs). Currently, we have shifted some of the patients to the ICUs due to lack of space, even though they do not require intensive care. This occupies more space at ICUs which are required by patients in a more critical condition. More staff is also a must. Nurses should be extended to treat patients more effectively and efficiently. This will help us reduce the number of deaths caused by Dengue,� Prof. De Silva said. ��The rise in the number of Dengue patients with the monsoon season has brought more devastating results than expected. Unknown modes of Dengue breeding have been uncovered by research. It has been surmised that Aedes aegypti, mosquitoes that transmit Dengue, possess the ability to breed in salty and dirty water. This causes a general perception that Dengue can only breed in clear, clean water to stand corrected also extending the range of potential mosquito breeding sites to which our attention has to be directed to. ���This year, Dengue has risen like we have never seen before. The �Type 2� Dengue virus is to also take the blame for this drastic rise. Researches prove that Dengue mosquitoes can also breed in salty and impure water. Hence, controlling the severity of the Dengue situation in the country corresponds to managing a war at the moment. The conditions have worsened, particularly with the recent rains.� ���Garbage situation in the country is definitely linked to the Dengue matter causing negative effects on the issue. We should approach an all-out ban on plastic that should include polythene bags in the least�Professor Arjuna pointed out that the development of a Dengue vaccine was underway. ���It will be awhile before the Dengue vaccine will be administered in the treatment of patients as it is still being developed and has not been tested out yet. But once done, the situation in the country will improve drastically. Other prevalent issues do not seem to help resolve this menace any further. For instance, can the garbage dilemma in the country aggravate the Dengue victim count this year? ���The garbage situation in the country is definitely linked to the Dengue matter causing negative effects on the issue. We should approach an all-out ban on plastic that should include polythene bags in the least. Efforts to control Dengue should continue as Dengue shows signs of remaining for a long time. The government should look into these concerns and take apt measures forthwith. But they alone cannot accomplish this. We have to assist as well.� ����Refuting the allegations that the hospital has provided drugs other than Paracetamol to patients, Consultant Physician of the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama clarified that some private hospitals have engaged in such medical practice and that Infectious Diseases Hospital was not responsible for any such medical malpractice. ���Currently, an inquiry is being conducted by the ministry with regard to this matter. Government hospitals don�t administer any other drug except Paracetamol to its Dengue patients. Sometimes, patients tend to take drugs such as Diclofenac Sodium instead of Paracetamol either on their own accord or upon the directions of a private medical practitioner. Such things could lead into health complications in a Dengue patient,� he said. ���Sometimes, patients tend to take drugs such as Diclofenac Sodium instead of Paracetamol either on their own accord or upon the directions of a private medical practitioner�Commenting on the number of Dengue patients being admitted into the hospital, Dr. Wijewickrama said despite there were no deaths reported, the number of Dengue patients being reported at IDH had increased significantly. �He said all hospitals in Colombo were filled beyond their capacities with Dengue patients. ���Dengue widespread has raised severe concerns throughout the island, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) share their thoughts on the outbreak. Dr. Sugandhika Perera voiced her concerns regarding the epidemic on behalf of the WHO. ���Dengue cases are increasing globally with more frequent and severe outbreaks. Effective mosquito control through active community participation and taking measures to prevent mosquito bites remain the mainstay of Dengue prevention. These measures need to be further strengthened, particularly in the identified high-risk districts, after experiencing the South West monsoons. Raising awareness among people to ensure they fully participate in preventing and removing vector breeding sites from the environment � their homes, workplaces and other surroundings are of critical importance. Additionally, people must take adequate personal protection measures to protect themselves against mosquito bites.� � According to Dr. Perera, the WHO is closely monitoring the situation and liaising with relevant authorities to help control the Dengue uproar. ���WHO has been supporting the government for building capacity of health staff on Dengue management, mosquito control measures and effective community awareness and engagement��The WHO has been supporting the government for building capacity of health staff on Dengue management, mosquito control measures and effective community awareness and engagement. The WHO is liaising closely with the Epidemiology Unit, National Dengue Control Unit and Disaster Preparedness and Response Division of the Health Ministry to provide technical assistance required by the government.� ���Dr. Prachila Samaraweera, Consultant Community Physician attached to the Dengue Control Unit, said fumigation was being carried out islandwide in areas that have been identified as Dengue breeding grounds. ���Currently, a rising number of patients have been reported from fourteen districts, among which Colombo, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Hambantota, Puttalam, Kegalle, Kurunegala and Ratnapura have recorded a high number of Dengue patients. Therefore, instead of fumigating one selected location, we have decided to conduct a special fumigation programme according to a cluster method in selected locations. The fogging programme is carried out as either individual fogging or carpet fogging in these areas. Despite the importance of eliminating areas that are identified as mosquito breeding grounds through fogging, it should be noted that the effect of fogging would remain in the fumigated area only for about half an hour or so. ���Instead of fumigating one selected location, we have decided to conduct a special fumigation programme according to a cluster method in selected locations��Therefore, even if adult mosquitoes in the area are destroyed, if the location provides a favourable atmosphere for mosquito larvae, the total eradication of Dengue mosquitoes through fumigation would remain a futile effort. We have already taken steps to identify and destroy mosquito breeding sites with the cooperation of the military police, government institutes, health officials and the support of the general public. It is important to remove empty cans, tyres and containers from lying on the ground and dispose them properly because the adult female mosquito lays eggs in fresh water accumulated in such containers,��Dr. Samaraweera said. ��According to the Dengue Control Programme that would be conducted for three months as per the President�s directive, all schools have been advised to clean their premises once a week on every Friday for one hour which is currently being carried out in an effective manner. � ��We have also advised all institutes representing the public and private sectors to take similar initiation in their office premises. It is compulsory that patients who have fever for more than forty eight hours get themselves tested for a full blood count. Measures have also been taken to lower the charges of the full blood count to a maximum of Rs. 250 in private medical institutions,� Dr. Samaraweera added.���Speaking to,�Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital Director Dr. Susitha Senaratne said the situation with regard to administering Dengue patients was under control although they experienced a problem few days ago in accommodating patients. ���Dengue patients are being admitted to hospital, depending on the availability of beds. However, we see a significant rise in the number of Dengue cases although no deaths were reported from the Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital during the recent past. Some unknown change may have triggered lately since the number of Dengue larvae has risen fourfold. ��Rainfall, poor waste management systems as well as natural disasters like floods have further intensified mosquito breeding grounds islandwide. Also, mosquitoes bearing the �Type 11� virus have increased over time, thereby making patients more vulnerable to the viral fever. We noticed that patients who were diagnosed with Dengue fever suffered from various complications than those who had contracted the disease for the first time. Our hospital staff is doing everything possible within their capacity to treat the patients,� Dr. Senaratne added. ���Number of Dengue cases although no deaths were reported from the Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital during the recent past�When inquired about the availability of Dextran, he said the drug was available in sufficient quantities. Further, he advised that patients should not be administered any pill other than Paracetamol since that could lead into other complications including excessive bleeding.�According to Government Medical Officers� Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge, the Dengue situation in the country has already reached unacceptable levels. He sheds light upon a crucial point with regard to recent developments. ���With two hundred deaths per 60,000 Dengue patients, the death prevalence this year remains unacceptably high. Sri Lanka was able to reduce the Dengue death prevalence starting from 2012 until last year with the help of protocols, but this year, this value has reached almost double the value of last year,� he reveals. ���The government should take more interest in establishing the reason for this high number. Some of these deaths could have been prevented. So, they need to conduct district-level death reviews to go in depth to investigate the causes for these deaths,� Dr. Aluthge said, adding that doing so would help prevent such events from recurring in the future. � �According to Dr. Aluthge, some of these deaths had been caused by �Quacks� who posed as qualified doctors. They have prescribed painkillers that contraindicate Dengue. � When inquired if there was a connection between Dengue and garbage, two of the biggest crises the government is facing currently, Dr. Aluthge said there was so. ���Although the officials strive to attribute the ever-increasing number of Dengue patients to the change in the viral strain, entomological surveys have revealed an unacceptable increase in mosquito density in the past few months. The solid waste that is lying by the roadside without being collected definitely plays a big part in this. The government should have a national plan on garbage management, and the local authorities� active participation should be ensured,� Dr. Aluthge stresses. ��When questioned if the government had taken adequate measures to raise public awareness on this concern, Dr. Aluthge said: �The Health Ministry has recently focused most of its energy on whitewashing the name of SAITM via paid advertisements using public money. They should focus those efforts plus the money on raising awareness on crucial matters like Dengue on mass media, specially focusing on preventing deaths caused from Dengue,� he said. ���The government should take more interest in establishing the reason for this high number. Some of these deaths could have been prevented�Dr. Aluthge also commented on the unequal distribution of resources by the government, taking as examples the situations where supplies like fogging machines and vehicles did not reach the areas where they were needed the most. He points out that this is due to the lack of a proper system for the ground-level information to reach administrative levels. ��Commenting on the situation where there was an abundance of patients in some hospitals, he suggests that the government should use the underutilised wards in nearby hospitals to the National Infectious Disease Hospital and other major hospitals. � ��Specialist physicians and paediatricians should be assigned to those wards in a visiting basis,� he added presenting GMOA�s solution to the problem. ��Further, he emphasised the need for a national-level plan to prevent further Dengue casualties which is more crucial than ever. ���One of the main reasons for the non-implementation of necessary plans is the lack of proper leadership within the Health Ministry. With the absence of a Health Secretary for more than two months and with an Acting Director General in place of a permanent one, the ministry has failed to achieve their maximum in a crisis situation like this. � ��We gathered the experts in both curative and preventative sectors of Dengue to one place for an action committee meeting held on Monday, since we see deficiencies in government intervention.There were discussions about many crucial points like the ground-level participation in sending information, updating the current information gathering systems, and the final conclusions would be presented as a proposal to the government at the end of this week,� he added. � �Dr. Aluthge stresses that this is not a time to take sides but a time to put all differences aside, commenting that the Health minister is reluctant to work in unity with the trade unions. ���As the GMOA, we ask the president to intervene in this matter and take things into his own hands at least as a temporary measure. We ask him to join us to save the country from the impending disaster,� he concluded. � ��One of the main reasons for the non-implementation of necessary plans is the lack of proper leadership within the Health Ministry��Meanwhile, a confidential source who wished to remain anonymous from inside the Central Province healthcare sector divulged that the patient load in many of the main hospitals in the Central Province increased daily, reaching an uncontrollable level. The hospital staff and facilities are highly inadequate to manage the overwhelming number of patients, hence the staff is forced to discharge the patients as soon as they are out of the critical phase.The source also pointed out that the growing problem of garbage in the Central Province as a main cause for the increasing Dengue incidence in the area, and stressed on the need of practicing proper disposal of garbage. The source also urged the government to take immediate action to supply the equipment like infusion pumps and necessary drugs to the needed hospitals as soon as possible. ������",dengue
BRACE FOR DENGUE,"2017-06-22 01:03:03							0						 				724","There were 587 dengue patients per 100,000 in the Colombo District, Colombo Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ruwan Wijeymuni told the Daily Mirror yesterday.Updating the media on the status of the epidemic in the city, Dr. Wijeymuni said that according to statistics, the Colombo City would have 421 dengue patients per 100,000 of the resident population. �However, there had only been 2,740 patients reported from the city. Which is much less than is expected and is an indication that we have controlled the epidemic to some degree,� he said.Reading out statistics, the CMO stated that there were 298 dengue patients per 100,000 of population across the country. However, with at least 45 percent of the patients being reported from Western Province, statistics showed there were 448 dengue patients per 100,000 in the Province. With at least 200 deaths reported due to the epidemic, 50 percent of which was reported from the Western Province, the three deaths reported from Colombo C i t y was a relief.��If we inspected one hundred houses, 10 to 12 percent of the houses would have potential breeding areas, this has to be brought down to 5 to 6 percent,��We can�t say that we are happy about the situation but there aren�t many deaths reported from the city,� he said.Health sources reported 61,000 dengue patients for the first six months of the year, while 51,000 patients were reported in 2016. The country was dealing with the highest number of dengue patients ever reported in its history, Dr. Wijeymuni said.The number of potential dengue breeding grounds had to be reduced to ensure there is no outbreak. �If we inspected one hundred houses, 10 to 12 percent of the houses would have potential breeding areas, this has to be brought down to 5 to 6 percent,� he said.At least two percent of the residential areas, was also found to have dengue larvae, which again should be brought down to one percent. �These numbers are much higher in some areas in Kalutara and Gampaha,� the CMO said. However, the solution to the dengue epidemic was not the reduction in breeding grounds and larvae but eradication of it.Explaining the unique features of the epidemic, Dr. Wijeymuni stated that many of the patients reported this year were below the age of 18. �When the epidemic first began it affected the children and then the elderly, but it seems the fever is affecting children once again,� he said. Fifty two percent of the patients reported with the fever were below the age of 18.�The public seem to have forgotten the initial measures we took to ensure children would not be affected by the fever.Measures, such as wearing long sleeved shirts and long pants and using mosquito repellents are some simple measures that can be taken,� he said. Speaking of measures taken to eradicate dengue breeding grounds, Dr. Wijeymuni stated that officials fumigated areas which had reported high number of dengue patients.He said that houses had been inspected with warning given when potential dengue breeding grounds were found and legal action taken during extreme cases.�Filing legal action is not our main aim, but we have been forced to do so in some cases,� the CMO said.When compared to previous years the number of dengue patients had not reduced during February and March but had continued to increase.�The peak period for dengue is June and July and November and December. This time we had to deal with an increasing number of patients from the beginning of the year and we can see signs of it increasing now as well,� he said. The CMO also stated that 86,639 residents had been inspected with 8,216 potential breeding grounds and 897 breeding grounds found.�All seven ports come�under Dengue radarBY DARSHANA SANJEEWAIn accordance with the recommendation by President Maithripala Sirisena a dengue eradication programme had been implemented in all Government institutions, an official said. The dengue eradication programme is to be launched under the leadership of Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe in all the seven ports connected to the Colombo Port, in the next few days. All possible steps have been taken to implement the programme and it would be implemented regularly in the future.Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe initiated this programme at the Colombo Port recently.

Attack on Uni. students: GMOA to launch a token strike today,"2017-06-22 00:13:29							34						 				12499","The Executive Committee of the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) last night decided to resort to a trade union action that will lead to a countrywide token strike to begin at 8.00am today, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.Speaking to Daily Mirror Dr. Aluthge said the decision to launch an indefinite strike was taken for two reasons, firstly condemning the brutal attack on university students who protested at the Health Ministry building yesterday and secondly for not extending the tenure of Professor Carlo Fonseka as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), a decision taken by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.Dr. Aluthge pointed out that according to the SLMC Ordinance a Chairman could be appointed for five years. Professor Fonseka�s five-year term expired in December last year. After a request by the SLMC Professor Fonseka�s tenure was extended by another six months by the Health Minister. That extension was to expire on June 30 and while his tenure could be extended by the minister for another six months thereafter, Minister Senaratne seems to be against this and was trying to appoint one of his favourites to the post, Dr. Aluthge said.An emergency Executive Committee meeting will be held at 12 noon today at the GMOA Head Office to decide on further action.He further said that doctors at hospital emergency units, Dengue control units and hospitals in the disaster affected areas would continue to treat patients as before.

�Knowing your enemy� in the Battle against Dengue,"2017-06-21 14:10:34							0						 				5273","�Dengue has raised its head more viciously than ever before, with the onset of the monsoon season. Hospitals are overflowing with dengue patients and healthcare workers everywhere are undergoing a fierce battle to monitor and treat patients with the limited staff they have. We, as responsible citizens of the country cannot wash our hands off the topic, leaving the care of patients to hospital staff and the government. The carriers of dengue are bred all around around us, in our gardens and workplaces, without out noticing. Therefore, if each of us did our part,�we as a nation could eliminate this disaster from its roots.�By �Punnami Amarasinghe & �Gayan Suriyarachchi�� There is a saying among soldiers that you can never have too much information on your enemy. This is why the Health Capsule decided to interview Dr. Indika Ellawala, Chief Medical Officer of Health, Rathmalana, to take you through the basics of dengue, starting from the virus and the carrier to the disease, treatment and most importantly, prevention. Read on if you want to become an active soldier in the battle against dengue. ��Dengue is a disease transmitted by a virus. There are four basic types of dengue viruses, Type 1, 2, 3 and 4. Since a single virus can make you sick only once, this basically means you could get dengue four times in your life. Don�t be alarmed though, because most of the time, dengue acts similarly to other viral fevers and you might have even developed the disease previously without your knowledge. ��Talking about the transmission of dengue, the virus enters the bloodstream through two mosquito breeds, the Aedes Aegyptii and Aedes Albopictus. The female mosquito usually lays eggs in clear water. Just a few spoonfuls of water is enough for them to survive. So, in addition to susceptible places like yoghurt cups, empty coconut shells, flower vases and tyres, inspect unlikely places like empty polythene bags or plant stems where water could collect. ���According to Dr. Ellawala, the female mosquito gets infected when it bites a person who has the virus in his or her bloodstream. In addition, the eggs laid by an infected female mosquito also leads to the hatching of mosquitoes that carry the virus. When these mosquitoes bite an uninfected person, they release the virus into the bloodstream. The first symptoms of the disease appear 5-7 days after an infected mosquito bite. ��Dengue can be usually present in two forms, says Dr. Ellawala. �1) Dengue fever �2) Dengue Haemorrhagic fever ����Symptoms of dengue are the sudden onset of high fever, severe headaches, pain behind the eyes, vomiting and muscle and joint pain. Dengue haemorrhagic fever is deadly and early diagnosis and treatment is crucial. If the fever lasts for more than two days, a full blood count will make diagnosis easier. A dengue Antigen Test can be performed with the onset of fever�, says Dr. Ellawala. ���In dengue haemorrhagic fever, bleeding and shock may sometimes occur,� he continued.�Symptoms of bleeding usually occur after 3-5 days of fever. If the patient is going into shock, additional symptoms like severe abdominal pain, bleeding from gums, skin bruising, frequent vomiting with blood and black stools resembling tar can occur.� According to him, pale cold skin, restlessness and irritability are also signs of shock. ��If you suspect you have dengue fever, your doctor will decide if you should be admitted to hospital or not after considering your report results, age and general condition.��In case of home management, the patient should rest and take adequate fluids (water, soup, fruit juice) to bring down the fever. The only drug recommended is Paracetamol�. Dr. Ellawala also advises patients to sleep under a mosquito net. ����Since dengue is a viral disease, the virus will be removed by our own immune system without the need for medication. We have to let the body do its own work. In a hospitalized patient, the main method of management is through fluid and frequent monitoring, done by checking the vital signs and conducting ultra sound scans of the body. If the patient is going into shock, resuscitation is done. Early diagnosis is essential in Dengue�, stresses Dr. Ellawala. He further adds that most dengue casualties so far were due to late diagnosis and �seeking of medical care when the patient was critical. ��While managing patients is important, preventing the disease occurring in the first place would be the most effective method to combat it. In addition to the obvious benefits to people, it will benefit the government as a whole because the huge expenditure spent on diagnosis and treating the ever-increasing number of dengue patients will be spared. �It is found that in most cases, the source of dengue is in the house of the patient itself�, comments Dr. Ellawala. Therefore, it�s our duty to clean the environment of mosquito breeding grounds before pointing fingers at the government and at other officials. ��Many of us have made it a point to clean our premises when we heard that a visit from Public Health Inspectors was due soon, since we fear legal action. According to Dr. Ellawala, this is not how it should be, especially at a time like this, where dengue is spreading like wildfire. We should keep our surroundings clean, not because of the fear of the �dengue inspections�, but because as responsible citizens, it�s our duty to safeguard our family and neighbours from this deadly disease. ��He advises that special attention should be given to roof gutters while cleaning premises of mosquito larvae. �While at it, take care to participate in cleaning your workplace or school as well. The fact that the dengue-carrying mosquito is a �day biting� mosquito, makes this practice even more important since we spend most of our day time in these places. � ��So the take-home messages from this article are to seek medical advice in case of a fever, especially in dengue endemic areas, refraining from using painkillers except paracetamol in case of fever and seeking immediate medical care if you develop any symptoms associated with fever. Last but not least, contribute to the ongoing battle against dengue in the best way you can, by destroying possible mosquito breeding grounds around you. This is because the most vulnerable point in the dengue cycle is the larvae stage, which is within our reach, in the breeding grounds supplied by ourselves. �",dengue

'Cuban government applied rigid rules such as demolishing houses which were found to be dengue breeding grounds and we cannot implement such tough laws"" he said.The Minister said a new trace of Dengue which causes severe symptoms than usual have spread over to Sri Lanka �There were only Dengue virus 1 or 4 in Sri Lanka earlier but a new trace have been found in the island lately,"" the minister said. He said it is this new trace that has caused much trouble.He said patients are being treated in hospital clusters. Citing an example he said a cluster had been created by arranging special wards in IDH Mulleriyawa, Talanggama, and Vetara hospitals to treat the patients.The minister accepted that there are instances where two patients occupy one bed. ""Providing mosquito nets to hospital beds as patients have refused be under nets when they share beds"" he said.He said more than 700,000 breeding grounds have been found across the island and had been fumigated.

Schools have also advised their students and teachers to bring their food in boxes instead of polythene bags.Schools such as Visakha and Ladies� are separating the garbage in bins and sending away waste such as paper for recycling and food waste for compostingWe further learnt that more time needs to be given in larger schools such as Royal College in order to get the students used to the segregation process and that they are working to reduce the amount of non-degradable waste that is created. � Many meetings and awareness programmes have been conducted for officials in the schools to encourage them to manage and reduce the garbage in the respective schools.Health Consequences due to the Accumulation of GarbageAccording to Professor Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama there are many health consequences that can arise due to the accumulation of garbage in the area. � �The obvious consequence is dengue. Because it has been shown that dengue mosquitoes can breed even in dirty water now and not just clean water. There will be an increase in flies in the area which would lead to a rise in food borne and fly borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, dysentery� ��If the garbage starts contaminating the water supply, such as our drinking water and the water we use for washing:many issues can arise on a domestic levelHe further said that if the garbage starts contaminating the water supply, such as our drinking water and the water we use for washing: many issues can arise on a domestic level. Fly borne, mosquito borne, even filaria like diseases and even skin allergies can increase. � Analysing the consequences at school level, he said,�In schools, as there is a large population of young people in one place, who are very susceptible compared to older people and there is the danger of the spread of contagious diseases. As older people have built immunity over such diseases over the years such a high risk does not crop up for them�. ���",dengue
Melioidosis: another deadly disease that increases during floods,"2017-06-14 13:32:29							0						 				1883","�QWhat is melioidosis?Melioidosis is a tropical infection, transmitted from soil and water to humans. It is seen only in warm, tropical countries. The causative pathogen, Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a bacterium found naturally in soil and water. The bacterium enters the body through soil or water contamination of abraded skin.��QWho is at risk of being exposed to this infection?The infection is transmitted through exposure to soil, mud or water. Therefore, melioidosis is more common in people who have regular and frequent exposure to soil and water, such as paddy farmers, agricultural workers, home gardeners and construction workers. Since most rural Sri Lankans walk barefoot in their home compounds, paddy fields and roads, they may get exposed to this bacterium. During flooding, the whole community becomes exposed to large amounts of mud and water and the risk of contracting this infection increases. ��QWho is more likely to get melioidosis?Although many people get exposed to this bacterium, infection is more common in people with underlying medical problems, especially diabetes. However, in disaster conditions like flooding where there is a high exposure to contaminated water, even healthy people may get infected. ���Q What are the symptoms?There are no unique symptoms in melioidosis. Patients with melioidosis usually have fever. They may have lung infection with cough or skin abscesses. Some have infection in the liver, spleen, salivary glands, lymph nodes, bone or joints. Melioidosis can even infect the brain. Infection may develop very suddenly and acutely or develop insidiously and slowly over a few weeks. Melioidosis may be mistaken for other fevers, such as dengue or leptospirosis. ���QCan it cause an epidemic?Melioidosis occurs throughout the year in Sri Lanka but increases during the southwest and northeast monsoons. There is a rapid increase in cases of melioidosis during rainy weather, storms and flooding and other natural disasters. ���QWhat is the death rate in melioidosis?Melioidosis is a severe, potentially fatal infection and the death rate can be as high as 25-50%. However, early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment can save the patient. ��QIs melioidosis common in Sri Lanka?Melioidosis is increasingly recognized in Sri Lanka. According to our records, we have between 250�500 cases diagnosed in the last 10 years. Most of them were diagnosed within the last 3 years due to increased awareness among doctors. However, it is regrettable that there are many doctors in Sri Lanka who are not knowledgeable on this disease. ���QWhere is this infection found in Sri Lanka and does it affect adults or children?Meloidosis is found all over the island. Most cases are seen in rural, rice growing areas. It is less common in the cool hill country. Infection occurs in all age groups, including children and in both sexes, though the highest incidence is seen in middle-aged males. ���QIs there any treatment?There are well-established antibiotic treatment guidelines for the treatment of melioidosis. ���QAny take home message?Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Sri Lanka. It is widely distributed throughout the island and affects all age groups. It should be included in the diagnosis of fevers in Sri Lanka. �",dengue

Leptospirosis - Silent killer  in the background of heavy floods,"2017-06-07 14:27:49							0						 				2790","��Sri Lanka faced one of the biggest natural disasters ever in its history with the recent floods, which led to the loss of life of many innocent people. Looking back at these devastating episodes, it is always better to think of how they could have been prevented beforehand so that the negative impact of mother nature could be minimized, while the natural balance of the environment is maintained. �The distribution of medical drugs secondary to massive flood relief campaigns are seen throughout the affected areas of the country. �If you have ever taken part in such relief or have listened to the news, Doxycycline is a very common name one hears nowadays. It tops the list of drugs which prevent the disease LEPTOSPIROSIS (Rat fever/ Mee una), a life-threatening illness, most likely to raise its head in the backdrop of heavy freshwater floods. ��What is Leptospirosis?It is a worldwide zoonotic infection where the pathogen is transmitted directly or indirectly from animals to humans. It is commonly observed in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. Leptospirosis characteristically peaks during rainy weather or flooding. ��Incidence of the condition is higher among paddy farmers and according to the latest data, 3000-5000 people are suspected to be affected every year and many die from the disease (1-2%) if not diagnosed and treated properly. �Other risk groups: �Workers in coconut and sugar cane plantations, abattoirs and fish markets. �In Sri Lanka, suspected Leptospirosis is a notifiable disease and the Matara, Gampaha and Kaluthara areas have recorded the most number of cases in the recent past. ���What causes Leptospirosis?The main causative pathogen is Leptospires, which falls under the phylum of spirochaetes. These are found in the kidneys of animals such as rodents-rats and bandicoots and livestock (cattles, pigs) and wild mammals (rare in Sri Lanka). �Transmission of the infection to humans usually occurs by the exposure of abraded skin or mucous membranes (nasal, oral, eye) to water, wet soil or food and water, contaminated with urine from chronically infected yet asymptomatic animals, especially rodents. Once the pathogen enters the blood stream and invades all the tissues and organs of an individual, the symptoms may appear following 1-2 weeks after the initial exposure, and can occur even before that since the incubation period of the pathogen is found to be 2-26 days (average of 10 days). �How do patients present symptoms?Leptospirosis is a self-limited systemic infection or a severe, potentially fatal illness accompanied by multi-organ failure. �Initial symptoms (mimic mild flu and Dengue fever)	�Abrupt onset of fever with chills and rigors �	�Muscle pain (calf muscles, neck and back) ��	�Headache �	�Cough �	�Nausea and vomiting associated with diarrhea �	Conjunctival suffusion (red eyes and tenderness of muscles which appear on the third day of fever, characteristic but non-specific) �It is important to be aware of these initial features, in order to seek immediate medical advice before serious complications begin. We have noticed that most patients misinterpret these constitutional symptoms as simple viral fever and tend to ignore them, after which it�s really hard to manage them. �2nd phaseThis follows a short period of apparent well-being of the patient and occurs due to body�s immunological response to the infection. �Complications	�Aseptic meningitis (Inflammation of the protective layers of brain) �	�Myocarditis (Inflammation of heart muscles) �	�Pneumonia ��	�Interstitial Nephritis and acute tubular necrosis ��	�Hepatitis (Inflammation of liver) ��	�Jaundice (yellow eyes) �However, the good news is more than 90% of affected individuals with mild infection will recover spontaneously, even though some may progress up to an increased severity with kidney, heart and liver failure with wide-spread hemorrhage which would ultimately end up in death, if not managed promptly and properly (Case fatality rate -5%-30%: Epidemiological data). ����How are the patients diagnosed and managed?Early diagnosis is crucial in managing patients with Leptospirosis. However, this can be quite challenging due to non-specific initial presentation and difficult lab studies. ��Patients with suspected clinical signs and symptoms along with a history of an obvious occupational or recreational exposure should be tested for antibodies in blood and urine which will confirm the diagnosis. �The hallmark of the Leptospirosis treatment is antibiotics. �Suspected patients without any organ involvement or identified co-morbidities can be managed as out-patients and treated with doxycycline-100mg/12 hourly for 7 days. �High-risk patients with organ involvement or co-morbidities should be admitted immediately and treated with antibiotics; Penicillin, Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime.��What is the importance of Prophylaxis in Leptospirosis?According to the national guidelines in Sri Lanka, prophylactic treatment for Leptospirosis can only be given under the proper guidance and monitoring of public health authorities. However, during the recent flood crisis, this treatment was highly encouraged in individuals to prevent possible wide-spread of the infection. ���	�Doxycycline 200mg once a week is the recommended dose and this should be started few days before the exposure and continued throughout the period of exposure. ��	�Beneficial up to 7 days and if the risk continues, dose can be repeated under medical advice. �	�Doxycycline can be taken with or without food but preferably with a full glass of water. �	Strictly contraindicated in: ���-Children under 12 years ��-Pregnant and lactating mothers ��-Any previous allergic response to the drug �Prevention and Control	�People engaged in farming, mining, cleaning drains and canals are encouraged to inform their respective MOH and PHI where they will be made aware about the disease. �	Controlling the population of rodents around human habitation through proper sanitation and cleanliness. �	�Individuals with possible recreational and occupational exposure should always wear protective clothing, knee-high boots and gloves, and wounds and bruises should be covered properly �	�Minimize walking in floodwater and getting involved in activities associated without any prophylactic treatment. ��",dengue
Water; Lethal or Life preserving?  it all depends on the dose�,"2017-06-07 13:24:35							0						 				1197","��The word, �life� is tightly bonded with the word �water�. The first life form on earth is believed to have originated from water. A large percentage of all known life forms �are composed of water. About sixty percent of a healthy adult human male body comprises water; this again is divided into water that is contained inside cells and water outside of the cells, in the fluid portion of the blood called the plasma and in the tissue fluid. Water is ingested into our body through both the food and drinks we consume and exits our body through urination, defecation, sweating and through the breath we exhale, in the form of moisture. In order for the body to function properly, the intake and the output of water in the body should be balanced, because so many functions in our body are dependent on water.�How much water should a person drink?The famous saying that a person needs eight glasses of water per day is without scientific basis, because the amount of water that a person requires depends on the amount of water that gets removed from his body. This amount is different from person to person because the quantity of water lost from a person�s body in a day depends on many internal and external factors unique to that person. A person�s age, sex, body weight, his level of activeness, the water content of the food that he consumes, the climate, will all play a part on his daily needs of water. People living in tropical climates like us need relatively more water.�Inadequate water in the body has many consequences. The most immediate effect is dehydration.Limiting your water intake for a long time can have consequences like urinary stones, constipation, infections in the urinary tract, muscle cramps and high blood pressure.�About dehydrationDehydration is categorized into mild moderate and severe forms according to it�s level of seriousness. Even though mild and moderate dehydration can usually be reversed with adequate fluid given orally or intravenously, severe or even in some cases, moderate forms, may lead to fatal consequences like fits, brain damage and even death. Dehydration can occur through excess water removal from the body in addition to not drinking enough water. Therefore people who work outdoors for long periods of time resulting in excessive sweating need to drink plenty of water. Patients who have severe vomiting or diarrhea, especially small children and the elderly, need to stay hydrated by taking fluids like Jeewani and rice kanji in addition to water. If oral fluids are not tolerated, it�s important to seek medical help because the patient may need intravenous fluid resuscitation in the form of saline or similar fluids.�Did you know that one of the leading causes of death in severe burn patients is dehydration? Burning causes the upper layers of the skin, which works as a barrier that prevents body water from escaping into �the environment to be lost, causing severe water loss leading to shock and sometimes death.��Too much water?�But is there such a thing as �Drinking too much water?� It turns out that there is. It is called water intoxication. This is caused by drinking too much water in a too little time. Our body contains various ions dissolved in the body fluids. The ion levels in the blood, especially the sodium and potassium ion levels, is heavily controlled by the body�s regulatory system. When there is too much water in the system, this causes the sodium in the blood to be diluted, causing the condition called �Hyponatremia�. Symptoms may include vomiting, headache, lethargy and convulsionsIn addition, in patients who have certain conditions like heart failure and kidney failure, drinking too much water could overload the system, resulting in fatal consequences. In conditions like dengue fever too, the water intake of patients should be limited because it may later cause volume overload.�Drinking water in the morningEven though not much research has been carried out in western medicine on the benefits of drinking water on an empty stomach, drinking a glass of warm water is recommended in many forms of eastern medicine, including Ayurveda. It is said to help digestion and improve circulation.�",dengue

Monsoonal rains may signal an increase in dengue patients,"2017-06-07 00:00:41							0						 				2962","The record number of dengue patients and deaths recorded up to May this year mayincrease with the onset of the monsoonal rains. According to a Daily Mirror report last month, Dr. Prachila Samaraweera of the Dengue Control Unit of Colombo, has said some 44,000 dengue patients had been reported countrywide with 115 deaths. The number is massive compared to the previous year�s figure where some 55,000 dengue patients were reported with 97 deaths for the entire 2016. The increase in dengue patients is scary when considering that in 2015 there were only 30,000 dengue patients with 54 deaths.��While round table discussions are continuing and major campaigns including a three months dengue control programme has been launched, some important insights and simple and practical methods to control the spread of the mosquito breeding sites seem to have been ignored. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization�s former Engineer Ranjit Seneviratne has recently revealed some myths and ineffective practices that were being followed specially by state institutions to control the epidemic. He gives some enlightening information and practical methods which are useful to both ordinary citizens and authorities in their battle against dengue.���Various efforts are being made by the authorities and the Colombo Municipality personnel who are going around clearing plants and insisting that people who grow useful food plants like banana, Aloe Vera etc. should remove them � as well as flowering plants so useful to encourage bees and butterflies that are scarce in the city. This appears to be a sort of �knee-jerk� reaction, because if it were plants that harboured dengue-carrying mosquitos, then dengue should be rampant in villages with so much of vegetation there,� Mr. Seneviratne argues. �The reason for this is perhaps because plants are known to exude oils and bio-chemicals (much like humans exude salty sweat from the skin�s surface) and the dengue mosquitoes normally do not breed in such polluted water.� ��He says, on the contrary, dengue is rampant in cities that are densely populated and near schools � in other words where there are people and children who throw plastic yogurt and ice cream cups and plastic bags all over the place, as well as Thambili and coconut �shells�. � He emphasises the need for the authorities to insist that ice cream, yogurt, etc, should only be sold in paper cups (that could be easily torn to prevent water collection) and king coconut (Thambili) sellers should collect their �shells� in gunny bags � and be fined if they left them around. ��Another source of clean water favoured by the Anopheles Aegyptus Mosquito (implicated in the spread of dengue) are plastic bags. Therefore it is in everyone�s interest that the authorities should eliminate plastic bags and insist that only paper or cloth, jute-hessian or woven leaf (Dumbara Mat �Pang� and Palmyrah leaf) bags be used,� Mr. Seneviratne said. ��He also points out that public places where water collects are roads, because in Sri Lanka, people allow water from their properties to flow into the road, causing the road to break up and water to collect in small pot-holes. This is contrary to what happens in other countries where owners would be fined for such offences. � �The other place where water collects is public drains, because we the uncaring public, carelessly throw rubbish into drains, blocking the flow of water. The present practice is to spray toxic chemicals into these drains. As the drains are not water-tight, these harmful chemicals leak into ground water and could poison us. The effect is not immediate, but these chemicals are known to gradually accumulate especially in the fat cells and over time could cause cancer and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). �The FAO expert says a simple and inexpensive solution is to spray used engine oil (most of the harmful additives in the oil are �burnt up� in used oil). �The oil forms a film on the surface and the larvae of the mosquitoes during the pupal stage (when they are shaped like �commas�) are air breathers and come to the surface to breathe. The oil chokes the breathing tube and kills the pupal stage mosquito larvae. �Mr. Seneviratne also submits a more technical solution that could be implemented by the authorities to control dengue mosquitoes. He encourages the use of the �Sterile male� technique which was successfully used by the FAO to eliminate the �New World Screw Worm� (whose larvae bore into living flesh killing their host). This was done when there was an outbreak in North Africa from meat imported from South America and also from a West Indian Island that was infested, to prevent it from migrating to main-land USA. �",dengue

They charge that those detained under the PTA are unjustifiably remanded for decades with no charges against them or charges which are based on confessions made to police officers under duress. Human Rights activists claim that apart from the injustice faced at the hands of the police and the prison officials, they also undergo harassment from fellow prisoners. These prisoners detained under the PTA are constantly referred to by the Tamil politicians and Human Rights activists as �Political Prisoners.� ��Sri Lanka has had a history of certain abuses targeting prisoners under PTA. As a result of unrest created between those held under PTA and other non-Tamil prisoners in the past, those detained under the PTA and the Emergency Regulations are now exclusively housed at the New Magazine prison. However they are sent to the Welikada Prison Hospital for medical treatment. ��Velayutham Varatharajan, remanded at the New Magazine Prison, was implicated in an attempt to assassinate former President Chandrika Kumarathunga. He was convicted by the High Court of Colombo under the PTA for aiding and abetting the attempt. His appeal is currently pending at the Court of Appeal. On April 22, he had fallen sick and was admitted to the Welikada prison hospital. Initially he was admitted to the open ward. Thereafter he had been moved to the cell section in the hospital which is similar to a prison cell. K.S. Ratnavale, human rights activist and senior lawyer who is appearing on behalf of Varatharajan said that most PTA detainees were directed to this cell section. �This is not because of prison overcrowding but simply because they are political detainees and are of a particular ethnicity,� he said.Varatharajan, who is under medication for hypertension, had refused to go to the cell section. He had been writhing in pain and doctors expressed suspicion that he may have contracted dengue. Despite his condition, the Officer-in-charge had moved him to the cell section and he had to sleep on the floor. �The doctor who checked him the next day recommended that he should be admitted to the National hospital. But he was not taken and the officers assaulted and verbally abused him saying that he was from the Magazine prison and therefore should not be taken. Even the doctor�s recommendation is not taken seriously,� said Ratnavale. ��According to Ratnavale, the treatment at the Welikada prison hospital is very basic. �They only have a few painkillers and other basic medicines. Drugs prescribed to patients are not available. Though there is a procedure to bring drugs from outside, it is cumbersome and time-consuming. There are no X ray facilities. They are willfully keeping the standards low. The prison hospital only serves politicians convicted by courts or remanded. People like Duminda Silva who have been sentenced to death are in the Open ward, though they are not sick. But the truly sick are neglected,� added Ratnavale. ��Unable to bear the discriminatory attitude of the prison authorities and the horrific conditions under which he was placed, Varatharajan had pleaded with the doctor to be released from the hospital. However, the doctor had refused as his condition was serious. Varatharajan persistently said he would take responsibility. Consequently he was sent back. ��Ratnavale said that when doctors recommend prisoners to be taken to the National Hospital for treatment under the PTA, they have to be escorted. However this escort is not available at all times. When there is no escort, despite the patient�s helpless cries and the doctor�s recommendation, the patient is not taken. �They are taken to the hospital only when the Court orders it. It takes a few days to get a Court Order,� said Ratnavale. ���Step-motherly treatment is given to prisoners, so much so that prisoners don�t want to go to the prison hospital. It is ill-equipped and officers are racist. Minor staff members are convicted criminals who are themselves racist. They often assault these prisoners,� said Ratnvale. According to recent reports, at least 15 prisoners work as nurses at the Welikada prison hospital. Though there are six main wards in the Prison with nearly 300 patients, there are only three nursing officers. According to Health Ministry sources, the provision of nursing staff falls under the purview of the Prison Department. ���Another prisoner�s blood sugar level went very high and his left side was almost paralyzed. When he was admitted to the prison hospital, they refused to give him treatment. He was kept there for a long time and wasn�t given any food. Though the doctor had recommended urgent treatment, the Commissioner General said that was not the case,� Ratnavale added, pointing out how the doctors� recommendation was overridden by top prison officials. As a result of the �step motherly� treatment at the Welikada Prison hospital, �political prisoners� now plead for an established medical centre at the magazine prison. � Attorney-at-Law Suren D. Perera said that in 2013, when a victim was severely tortured at the Bogambara Remand prison, he had been denied admission to the General Hospital, as the General Hospital doctors inquired about injuries and refered them to the JMO and the police if they suspected there had been a human rights violation. ���Political prisoners or not?The government has repeatedly stated that there were no political prisoners in the country. When asked about this claim, Fr. Sherard Jayawardane said the statement was unacceptable. �In 1971 and 1989, JVP Sinhalese youth fought for a political cause. Similarly, the LTTE also fought for a political cause. They wanted freedom and therefore it was a political cause,� he said, adding that the government�s claim was merely a cover up. Speaking to Daily Mirror at a protest held recently by the National Movement for Release of Political Prisoners, he stressed that the government should release all political prisoners. He added that the disadvantaged Tamil minority had not still been offered a political solution for their predicaments which are manifold. ���Are all PTA detainees LTTE sympathizers?Not all detainees are hardcore LTTE supporters. Daily Mirror learns reliably that while leaders of the LTTE have escaped imprisonment, a majority detained under the PTA are merely implicated, had no part in the master plans and have been in remand for years. According to Perera, �political prisoners� in the Kandy remand prison are not hardcore LTTE cadres. �They are upcountry Tamils who have lived in estates for a very long time. The LTTE have bribed them with money or beer, to entice them to provide their three-wheelers and other assistance as needed,� he said. � �The hardcore LTTE leaders have not been arrested. Through my clients, I have learned that the LTTE leader in Kandy was not arrested. He has gone to Malaysia,� added Perera. ���The Prevention of Terrorism ActThe repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act No.48 of 1979 (PTA), has been repeatedly demanded by Human Rights activists. The PTA introduced in 1979 was intended to be a temporary measure. However in 1982, the PTA was made a permanent law in the country. Under the Evidence Ordinance, confessions made to police officers are not admissible before courts. This Ordinance was introduced by the British who were well aware of the notoriety of police officers for torturing inmates and obtaining confessions. However according to the PTA, confessions made to police officers above the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) are admissible. Yet activists point out that the practice of torture is prevalent even among top officials. ��Ratnavale said that nearly 99% of cases filed under the PTA were based solely on the confessions of the accused which were more often than not, extracted by inflicting fear and under duress. � Usually the prosecution proves the case against the accused. However, the PTA mandates that the burden of proof lies on the accused. �In most cases, the main evidence is the confession. In the Voir Dire inquiry, we must prove that the confession was extracted under duress. So the burden of proof lies with the accused,� explained Perera. He pointed out that in practice, it was extremely difficult to prove that a confession was extracted under duress as there would be no witnesses to speak on behalf of the accused. �So in most cases the accused pleads guilty,� he pointed out. ��Bail cannot be granted under the PTA and therefore many who have been implicated in LTTE-related violence have been in remand for decades. The PTA permits arbitrary arrests without warrants. ���They can be housed in unofficial places such as STF and army camps,� said Perera. Activists point out that the worst forms of human rights abuses take place in these unofficial detention centres. � �Perera also noted a hesitance on the part of judges and state counsels to initiate trials as they were time-consuming. As a result, trials are postponed. Perera further pointed out that plea bargaining was no longer in use, which has also restricted the options available to political prisoners. In plea bargaining, the defence counsel bargains with the state counsel and the judge on a punishment before the case is called. Then at the trial the accused pleads guilty and the decided punishment is given, which is most often a reduced sentence. �They amend the indictment for lesser charges for which there are no minimum charges. Then the judge can give a lesser sentence. Before February this year, the Attorney Generals Department had a policy to amend the charges under the PTA, where there was no damage to property or life. But they no longer amend charges,� he said. � The Counter Terrorism Bill which is to replace the PTA has been approved by the Cabinet. However, activists have pointed out that it is more draconian that the PTA. ���Other concernsCases based solely on a confession rejected by court should be withdrawn. However, this has not been the case with regards to charges against those detained under the PTA. �There is a trial going on in the High Court of Colombo based on the confession rejected in the Vavuniya High Court. Although the lawyers made submissions that the confession has to be rejected, the Attorney General did not consent to it,� said Ratnavale. ��He added, �In another trial, the confession made by a former police officer who has been in remand for the past eight years was rejected. But there are four other cases against him based on the same confession.� When cases with confessions rejected by a court are proceeded with by another court, it affects the consistency of judicial decisions. ���Legal frameworkSri Lanka has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Geneva Convention. Further, local statutes such as the Constitution and the Torture Act are supposed to protect people from arbitrary arrest and torture. The PTA however, contravenes provisions in them. ���When a victim was severely tortured at the Bogambara Remand prison, he had been denied admission to the General HospitalAttorney-at-Law Suren D. Perera��A timeline of major incidents affecting those held under PTA�1983- During the Black July riots, 50 Tamil prisoners were gruesomely killed at the Welikada prison. Prison authorities had allegedly encouraged convicts to attack the political detainees. Compensation was paid to the families of the victims consequent to cases filed in the District Court of Colombo by the Civil Rights Movement, spearheaded by the late Desmond Fernando P.C. who was twice President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) and Ms. Surya Wickremasinghe.2000- Two prisoners at the Kalutara prison were killed as a result of being attacked by fellow prisoners and guards. PTA detainees had organized a memorial event to commemorate leading politician and lawyer Kumar Ponnambalam on January 7, 2000. Prison authorities, angered by this gesture, opened the compound of the convicts who pounced on the political prisoners. Though the perpetrators were identified at the inquest, the Attorney Generals Department did not prosecute or pursue the matter. However the family of Sivaratnam Sri Kumar who was killed, filed a civil case for damages before the District Court of Kalutara. They received compensation of a reasonable sum. The Attorney General�s Department appealed against the award of compensation but the order of the Kalutara District Court was affirmed by the Appellate Court.2012- When prisoners protested against certain measures taken by the prison authorities at the Vavuniya prison, the Special Task Force was brought in on the orders of the leaders of the previous government. The STF allegedly assaulted the prisoners who sustained grave injuries. The twenty prisoners were taken to the Anuradhapura prison in the middle of the night where they were allegedly further assaulted. That same night they were then taken to the Mahara prison, where officers finally decided to direct them to the hospital. However two prisoners succumbed to their injuries.���PTA detainees are not discriminated within prisons�D.M. Swaminathan- Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement and Hindu Religious AffairsSpeaking to Dailymirror, D.M. Swaminathan, the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement, dismissed allegations that PTA detainees were discriminated within prisons. �If there is any discrimination and if I am informed, I will handle it. I will take steps immediately,� he said. ��According to him there are 72 detainees under remand custody whose cases are pending at various High Courts and whose trials are at different stages. Out of them, 57 are Tamils, 9 are Sinhalese and 6 are Muslims, he said. �The total number of cases pending at the Attorney General Department is 16. The total number of suspects is 29. Sixteen are Tamil, 8 are Sinhalese and five are Muslim. Out of the sixteen files, four indictments are being prepared and three have been recommended to be discharged. So these seven files will be over within another month�s time,� he added. � When asked about reports claiming prisoners were performing the duties of nurses, he said that if they were employed, they would be paid. �According to my knowledge, if prisoners are employed it is good as they get paid. They work in the prison hospital and not outside, so what is the harm? There is nothing wrong about that,� he said. ���The total number of cases pending at the Attorney General Department is 16. The total number of suspects is 29. Sixteen are Tamil, 8 are Sinhalese and five are Muslim.���They should be granted general amnesty, rehabilitated or bailed out�Mano Ganesan- Minister of National Co-existence Dialogue and Official LanguagesMano Ganesan, Minister of National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages said when the current government came to power there were around 200 detained under the PTA and this number has reduced to nearly 100. �This is a favourable and progressive step. Yet, we have to address the issues of the rest in detention under the PTA,� he added. ��Stressing that the PTA had to be repealed, he said the government had pledged to the nation and international community to do so. �This is going to be replaced by the Counter Terrorism Act. Its draft has been debated nationally and internationally. There are many negative opinions expressed to the extent that people claim it is more draconian than the PTA. This is a point to ponder over. But we can�t simply reject it. Though is has been drafted and has gone through the cabinet, it has to be amended before it comes to the parliament,� he said. ��Referring to those still detained, he suggested that they should be granted general amnesty, rehabilitated or bailed out. �Certain prisoners have been sentenced. But they have already spent 15 to 25 years in remand. They should be given general amnesty similar to how amnesty was granted to the southern insurgents in the 70s and 80s,� Ganesan said. �Others whose trials are ongoing should be bailed out or should be sent to rehabilitation centres. After the rehabilitation period of six months or one year, they should be sent home. When it comes to those who were not sentenced or charged but detained for investigation, they should be released immediately on bail,� he added. ��This is going to be replaced by the Counter Terrorism Act. Its draft has been debated nationally and internationally. There are many negative opinions expressed to the extent that people claim it is more draconian than the PTA. This is a point to ponder over. But we can�t simply reject it. Though is has been drafted and has gone through the cabinet, it has to be amended before it comes to the parliament���There are no political prisoners in Sri Lanka. There are only criminal offenders�Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe-�Minister of Justice and Buddha SasanaWhen asked about the government�s stance with regards to the campaign to release political prisoners, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Minister of Justice firmly maintained that there was not a single Tamil political prisoner in Sri Lanka. �There are only criminals. After Sarath Fonseka�s case there have not been any political prisoners in Sri Lanka,� he said. ���The Counter Terrorism Act is only a proposal. The law is the PTA. We have not applied it during the recent past,� he added. ��There are only criminals. After Sarath Fonseka�s case there have not been any political prisoners in Sri Lanka��Detainees are those whose trials are ongoing before courts or�who have been charged�Thushara Upuldeniya-�Prison Media SpokespersonRefuting the allegations made by activists Thushara Upuldeniya, the Prison Media Spokesperson reiterating the Minister of Justice, said there were no political prisoners in Sri Lanka. �Detainees are those whose trials are ongoing before courts or who have been charged,� he said. � When asked about the discrimination faced by those detained under the PTA, he said nothing of the sort had been reported to him. Responding to the allegation that prisoners perform the duties of nurses he said this was untrue. �There is a shortage of nurses and prison officials. We have received permission to recruit people. As a temporary measure, we have decided to recruit retired nurses,� he said. He added that there were no life-threatening shortcomings at the prison hospital and that facilities such as X-rays were available. ��However, when asked about the structure of the Welikada prison hospital, the media spokesperson refused to disclose information for security reasons. ��Detainees are those whose trials are ongoing before courts or who have been charged",dengue
"'Weather patterns change resulted in floods, landslides, dengue'","2017-05-27 03:00:28							9						 				4184","The changing weather conditions the world over have not only resulted in floods and landslides but also in a global outbreak of the dengue epidemic, Parliament was informed yesterday.Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the US Centre for Disease Control had so far sent out 900 dengue alerts globally with 400 alerts had sent out to countries in the Asian region.""Sri Lanka is also affected by the global epidemic while South Asia is the most affected,"" he said in response to a question asked by the joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene in the House last morning.The minister said Dengue Virus 1 and 3 was present in Sri Lanka at the moment. He said 48 people in Sri Lanka had died last year which is 0.2 per cent of those affected and added that in Sri Lanka it was the young adults and the elderly among the worst affected.The minister said several precautionary had been taken to prevent the spread of the disease in Sri Lanka such as the carrying out constant checks on places such as schools. He said a special ward has been set up at the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) in Mulleriyawa to care for the dengue patients.Earlier, Mr. Gunawardene had said there were 45,000 dengue patients in Sri Lanka up to now.""The statement by the health authorities that they alone cannot handle the situation is a clear indication on how grave the situation had become,"" he said.

Emerging Infections in Sri Lanka,"2017-05-24 13:37:29							0						 				2178","�Tropical infectionsOur country is a small island placed between 5� and 10� north of the equator and has a tropical climate. Sri Lanka has endemic transmission of many tropical diseases and has been battling them in public health campaigns. Some of these campaigns have been very successful. For example, polio, cholera and malaria transmission have been eliminated. Filariasis and leprosy prevalence rates are well below the WHO recommended elimination rate. The number of cases of human rabies has decreased significantly. Endemic tropical diseases that have been controlled to a large extent include typhoid fever, hepatitis A and dysentery, reflecting improved sanitation. Unfortunately, the incidence of tuberculosis (that is the number of new cases detected annually) remains almost constant. �Infections that may be introduced by travel/tourismIt is gratifying to note the extremely low prevalence of HIV and Hepatitis B in Sri Lanka. This is in stark contrast to other countries in the Asia Pacific region. Increased travel and tourism from these countries mean that there is a risk of introduction of these infections to the country. For example, India, just 50 km away, has more than 10 times Sri Lanka�s prevalence of HIV, five times its prevalence of chronic Hepatitis B and endemic cholera. To illustrate the problem of imported infections, is it important to recall that chikungunya, a mosquito borne viral fever, found its way across the Indian Ocean from Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles to India and shortly afterwards to Sri Lanka with devastating impact. Influenza, both seasonal and pandemic, is introduced to the country by returning travellers or tourists and is transmitted all year round, without the �winter� peaks seen in temperate areas.��Emerging infectionsRice is the staple diet of the population, with many people serving rice for all three meals. The shallow, clear waters of the paddy fields are the ideal breeding ground for Culex tritaeniorhynchus, the mosquito vector of Japanese B encephalitis. Japanese B encephalitis (JE) emerged in Sri Lanka in the 1980�s and wreaked a heavy toll, till an effective vaccine was introduced to the national immunization programme. ��A government sponsored effort to increase paddy cultivation resulted in many abandoned, rat-infested paddy lands being brought back into cultivation. This has been postulated as the cause for a sudden increase in the reported cases of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis, or rat fever, is contracted by the exposure of wounds or mucous membrane to water contaminated with rat urine. ��The forests that once covered most of the island have now been reduced. Deforestation results in an increase in the transmission of diseases from wild animals and birds (zoonotic diseases), as ticks, mites and sandflies, deprived of their animal hosts, look for new hosts. For example the rate of typhus fever, scrub typhus and cutaneous leishmaniasis has increased rapidly. ��Sri Lanka has a population of 21 million crammed into a country the size of Tasmania. That works out to about 317 persons per square kilometre. The bulk of the population still live in rural areas but there is migration to the cities and unplanned urbanization leading to the accumulation of mountains of garbage, which have become the breeding places for dengue mosquitoes and has fuelled the dengue epidemic. Interestingly, we have seen a change in the spatial distribution of dengue which has moved from the urban areas to semi-urban and even rural regions. One reason is the adoption of new rural breeding places by the dengue mosquito, like the coconut shell used to collect the rubber sap on rubber estates and gem pits. �Seasonal monsoons add to the risk of emerging infections, as rain leads to an increased breeding of Aedes mosquitoes and a sharp rise in dengue transmission, with a peak in infections shortly after the end of the monsoon. �Newly emerging infectionsAn emerging infection that has been described recently is melioidosis, caused by a bacterium in the soil. This infection is acquired by exposure to soil or muddy water, such as rice farming, gardening, construction work and manual labour. It is more common in diabetics. Melioidosis can appear as severe fatal infections or as abscesses in organs such as the lung, liver or spleen or as pneumonia. It is likely that the barefoot, outdoor, rural agricultural lifestyle practiced in Sri Lanka contributes to the prevalence of this infection. ��ConclusionConditions such as climate change, increased tourism, mechanization of agriculture, deforestation, increased urbanization and increased antibiotic resistance will lead to the introduction of new infections and the re-emergence of old infections. It is necessary to be alert to changing global and local patterns of infectious diseases. � ��",dengue
Dengue an ugly epidemic beyond our control?,"2017-05-19 03:36:52							1						 				5977","�Recent trends in dengue indicate a slight change in the disease progressionA child with dengue shock syndrome�As a growing epidemic with statistics indicating a sweeping rise in the number of victims falling prey to an irrepressible mosquito menace, Dengue has become one of the biggest threats that needs to be defeated by healthcare officials and the public. While eradicating mosquito breeding grounds has become a strenuous struggle, it is also surprising to note how recent trends indicate a slight change in the disease progression. With hospital staff continuously baffled by how to accommodate and provide equal attention and care to the rising number of patients being admitted to hospitals, the health sector is currently facing a huge challenge on how best to address the escalating dengue epidemic evident countrywide. Speaking to Daily Mirror, several experts representing the health sector shared their views and spoke on how best to address the dengue epidemic while highlighting the red flags that need to be tackled. Excerpts of their comments are given below.�		�Other than Paracetamol, any other medication should not be administered			�Staff and hospital facilities are inadequate to manage dengue patients			��People seek treatment late and believe in medical myths�	���Traditionally during the months of May, June and July, there is a dengue peak season with the monsoon�- Dr. Hasitha A. Tissera�When asked about the current dengue epidemic in the country, Dr. Hasitha A. Tissera, Consultant Epidemiologist at the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health, said dengue was globally on the rise and is not just an issue in Sri Lanka. �There are several countries where cases of dengue have increased and whose numbers are expected to rise over the next couple of months. Vietnam, Thailand and even Singapore have reported an increase in dengue cases due to the prevalent warm weather. The epidemic has also affected India and discussions regarding the issue are being held in Cambodia. An upsurge in the number of dengue patients are expected in these countries. A new trend currently being observed is the gradual spread of dengue to North America and Europe.� �One reason Dr. Hasitha gave for the drastic rise of dengue in the country was the change in global weather patterns. The dry humid season which is relatively warmer with unexpected rain spells in between and an erratic monsoon pattern has had an effect on the transmission of diseases through mosquitoes. Dengue is a viral disease. As long as the mosquito responsible- the Aedes mosquito- thrives in the environment, it would result in the spread and transmission of the disease, as their survival is co-related to environmental conditions. He further emphasized that another reason for the increase in dengue patients was due to the migration of people from relatively rural areas to urban areas on a regular basis. �When non-endemic people migrate to endemic areas, they are exposed to the mosquitoes and thereby transmission increases with more people getting infected in the process.There are four distinct types of dengue infections and multiple types of the virus. So during the transmission of the disease at a given time, a larger group of people get infected due to the co-circulation of these multiple types.� ���""People collect water during the dry season for household chores and these containers house breeding dengue mosquitoes""��He also mentioned that the major involvement of other stakeholders other than health and community has been inadequate in order to suppress the condition. �The media, local government, both public and private institutions and public administrative units each have a role to play and help mobilize and empower people to bear social responsibility to safeguard the community. It should be a continuous exercise. We live in a self-centred community. The environment is equally important when it comes to dengue. Children especially must be educated on the protection of the environment. The more polluted the environment is, the more dengue breeding sites there will be. Construction, urbanization and globalization are other issues we cannot control but if the methods through which they are implemented are properly monitored and regulated, the ill-effects can be minimized.� �He said awareness of dengue amongst the public was gradually deteriorating. �When the death toll from dengue decreases, awareness on the disease also decreases among people. They take it lightly. This is not good.� �The spike in the numbers of dengue patients have been astonishing, especially with the dry spell that has been experienced in the country thus far. �People collect water during the dry season for household chores and these containers house breeding dengue mosquitoes.� Starting from the month of May, the south west monsoons are expected to go on for three months until the end of July. This is considered the period when dengue reaches its peak. Thus, heavy concerns are raised regarding the rise of dengue patients when the monsoon starts. ����""Many of these measures were discussed. A three-month continuous programme has been drawn out and it will be in effect from the first of June""�Therefore, in order to suppress the epidemic and control the number of dengue victims with the upcoming monsoon season, President Maithripala Sirisena has held a special meeting on May 16 regarding dengue concerns. All stakeholders and the presidential task force were summoned by him to the meeting and the President has directed the relevant authorities to take measures to protect the public. �Many of these measures were discussed. A three-month continuous programme has been drawn out and it will be in effect from the first of June. Traditionally during the months of May, June and July, there is a dengue peak season with the monsoon. The monsoon season is expected to start at the end of this month. Therefore this is a very timely intervention.� Already 600,000 premises have been inspected with the help of the tri-forces and police carrying out extensive programmes over the last four months. On May 18 and 19, another programme is scheduled to be held in selected high-risk localities according to Dr. Hasitha. �During these three months we hope to make a sustainable effort. In the health sector, we are making changes in our day-to-day routine in hospitals to develop the capacity to cope with the increasing number of dengue patients. On the preventive side, the President has asked all institutions in the country- both public and private- including schools, railway stations and bus depots, to conduct a regular programme for one hour at least on a weekly basis to clean their surroundings,� he added. Dr. Hasitha sees this as a golden opportunity for the community to make up for their carelessness and take responsibility for the problem. �On a final note, as a message to the public, Dr. Hasitha requests the people not to take health matters into their own hands and to seek proper professional medical assistance when the first symptoms of dengue appear. ���Avoid strenuous activities, seek medical advice in case of a fever-Dr. Anil Jasinghe�Deputy Director General of the National Hospital Sri Lanka (NHSL) Dr. Anil Jasinghe, said that currently there were about 100 Dengue patients admitted to NHSL, with about 25 patients who need close monitoring. About 20 new patients are being admitted daily. He said recent initiatives had been taken in the hospital to expand the number of High Dependency Unit beds, which are reserved for patients in the critical stages of dengue, to 60.��He advised the general public to avoid strenuous activities and to seek medical advice in case of a fever, and if hospitalized, to strictly follow the doctor�s advice to drink fluid, because fluid management is a critical part of the treatment of dengue patients�""About 100 Dengue patients have been admitted to NHSL, with about 25 patients who need close monitoring. About 20 new patients are being admitted daily""�2,211 dengue patients admitted so far-Dr. Vajira DissanayakeDeputy Director of the Colombo North (Ragama)Teaching Hospital (CNTH), Dr. Vajira Dissanayake said there were 138 dengue patients in the ward as of midnight on May 14. A total of 2,211 dengue patients have been admitted to the CNTH within this year, with 22 deaths. � She said wards were overcrowded with more than 90 patients to 40 beds. The nursing staff and minor staff are also severely inadequate, according to Dr. Vajira. �She stressed on the importance of early diagnosis of the disease, because many deaths from dengue were due to the delay in seeking treatment, with patients only coming to hospital when they were in the critical phase. �""Wards were overcrowded with more than 90 patients to 40 beds""�Number of patients will increase with rainy seasonDr. Chandana KendagamuwaDirector (acting), Teaching Hospital Kurunegala, Dr. Chandana Kendagamuwa said that by 7 am on May 15, the number of confirmed dengue patients admitted to the hospital was 188, with 56 suspected cases. The hospital staff is not adequate to manage the heavy patient load, so they are getting help from the army and have requested the Director General of Health Services for more staff from the rural hospitals of the area. Dr. Kendagamuwa added that several hospital staff too had recently contracted dengue, further affecting the shortage of staff. Even though it cannot be confirmed that the staff contracted the disease from within hospital premises, preventive measures are being put in place daily. �Dr. Kendagamuwa predicts a possible further increase in the number of dengue patients with the beginning of the rainy season, and urges the general public to contribute to the prevention of dengue by destroying possible mosquito breeding sites in their homes and workplaces. �""Dr. Kendagamuwa added that several hospital staff too had recently contracted dengue, further affecting the shortage of staff""��50% of dengue patients are from the Western Province�- Professor Arjuna de SilvaDengue has risen drastically this year, and it has been the �main focus of many medical professionals all over the island. Professor �Arjuna de Silva, Consultant Physician, Teaching Hospital, Ragama also �expressed his views on the matter. �The dengue epidemic we are �facing this year is the largest we have faced so far. Only five months of this year have passed and there are over �40,000 dengue patients already. �The current viral trend of dengue type 2 �is a virulent virus type with more deaths taking place under dengue �type 2. Fifty percent of dengue patients are from the Western Province. More HDUs (high dependency units) have to be introduced to all �major hospitals so that more care can be given to patients with serious �conditions. Preventive measures are of utmost importance. A vaccine �against dengue is on trial these days. It has to be finalized as soon as �possible so that we can suppress the rising condition of dengue in the �country.� The dengue vaccine is anticipated to be finalized by next �year.��There is a possibility of a large epidemic spreading��- Dr. Ananda WijewickramaThe number of dengue patients presently being reported is quite high when compared to earlier, says Consultant Physician of the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama. He commented that with the onset of the monsoon, the possibility of a large epidemic taking place in the country was evident. Noting that the patient intake at the Infectious Diseases Hospital is also on a rapid rise, he said around ninety to a hundred dengue patients were admitted to the hospital on a daily basis. �There have been a couple of deaths reported owing to dengue fever. The main cause triggering these deaths was the result of patients being admitted to hospital quite late; almost at the last minute. We have advised the public to take a blood test at the end of the second day after developing a fever. However, in the event the fever becomes subdued, some patients tend to avoid getting their blood tested as recommended on the second day but consider getting admitted only when the fever worsens again. Some of these patients were given painkillers while suffering from dengue fever. Other than Paracetamol, any other pill or painkiller should not be administered while a patient is suffering from dengue. Taking such painkillers could cause serious complications in a dengue patient� Dr. Wijewickrama said. ���""�We have advised the public to take a blood test at the end of the second day after developing a fever. However, in the event the fever becomes subdued, some patients tend to avoid getting their blood tested as recommended on the second day""Noting that the symptoms of dengue fever have not changed overtime, Dr. Wijewickrama stressed that symptoms of dengue fever may include high fever, body aches, headaches and nausea. These are the commonest symptoms. When asked if plasma leakage could indicate a symptom progression in the patient, he explained that plasma leakage is one of the complications that must be detected early in patients. �There could be changes in the rate and timing of health complications depending on each patient. The main risk factor for the rising trend in the number of dengue patients reported is directly linked to the deadly increase in the number of dengue mosquito breeding grounds evident throughout the country. Due to the high number of dengue patients being admitted to the hospitals, the biggest issue faced by the health sector is how to accommodate all these patients in hospitals. Most hospitals in Colombo including those in Kalubowila, IDH, Homagama, Negombo and Ragama are filled with dengue patients beyond capacity,� he added.���Type 2 dengue, a more virulent virus plaguing the country�- Dr. Prachila SamaraweeraSpeaking to , Dr. Prachila Samaraweera of the Dengue Control Unit of Colombo provided a better insight to the state of the dengue epidemic that currently exists in the country and the reason for the sudden spike in the number of dengue patients. ��According to Dr. Prachila, there are four types of dengue viruses, namely types 1,2,3 and 4 and out of the 4, types 1 and 4 have existed in Sri Lanka so far, type 1 being predominant since 2009. Since mid-2016 however, type 2 has also been plaguing the country. This Dr. Prachila says, may be due to migrations. �The Type 2 dengue virus is a virulent virus compared to types 1 and 4. People infected with type 1 subsequently also get infected with type 2 and ultimately develop the dengue haemorrhagic fever state. For seven years, our country has not been exposed to the type 2 dengue virus, so people do not build up immunity to type 2 easily.� She further reasoned that people did not build up immunity to type 2 as it displayed different symptom patterns when compared with dengue types 1 and 4. �In dengue types 1 and 4, to reach the severe stage of the disease, it takes a while, with the progression of time. But in type 2, people reach the severe stages in a very short time where the platelet count drops rapidly.� ���""The Type 2 dengue virus is a virulent virus compared to types 1 and 4. People infected with type 1 subsequently also get infected with type 2 and ultimately develop the dengue haemorrhagic fever state""�When observing the dengue statistics of 2016 and 2017 in comparison, it is not wrong to say that dengue has reached an epidemic state this year. Dr. Prachila said that in 2016, 55,000 dengue patients were reported island wide with a death toll of 97 but when the current year is taken into consideration, for just five months, a number of 44,000 dengue patients were reported from across the island with a death toll of 115. Dr. Prachila also said the highest number of dengue patients were reported from Colombo, which according to her might be due to urbanization. �There have been various efforts on the government�s part in their attempts to reduce the spread of dengue in the country. Health campaigns, health inspection visits to houses and other premises to inspect dengue breeding sites, fumigation and pilot dengue vaccination programs are namely some. Despite all of these attempts, dengue has reached an epidemic state. �Upon admission of a dengue patient to the hospital, the hospital authorities inform the Health Ministry and our health inspectors visit the residential premises of the patients in order to inspect the area for dengue breeding sites.�There are only 2,000 health inspectors and the public expects our teams to show up and clean the premises to get rid of potential mosquito breeding sites. In other instances, when notified that health inspectors are visiting the locality, only then does the public take an interest in cleaning up their homes. This will not do.��The public must clean their premises themselves. The Health Ministry cannot be expected to clean each and every potential site for dengue mosquito breeding. To reduce the number of dengue victims, there has to be cooperation and support from the public. When speaking of fumigation, it is only effective on flying mosquitoes at the time of fumigating. It does not affect dengue breeding sites which are the source of the dengue problem,� says Dr. Prachila. �When asked whether she felt that awareness levels about dengue had risen among the public, she mentioned that a lack of awareness was not the issue. �People know about this. They just don�t care. People come to hospitals at the last minute to get treatment. They follow untested myths such as cures through the extracted juice of the papaya leaf, which are of no use whatsoever. If a patient contracts fever, it is now advised to consult a doctor and get a blood count within 24 hours.� She also added that people have to be vigilant for symptoms in order to receive proper medical treatment on time. � In 2015, there were reports of 30,000 dengue patients with a death toll of 54. Over the years the number of patients have increased along with the death toll. There is a directly proportional increase between the number of deaths and the number of dengue patients. �When the number of patients decrease, the rate of deaths follow. However when the rate increases, the health sector cannot cope with the number of patients. Each and every patient needs to be individually attended to. When the resources are limited, the death toll rises as facilities will not be helpful.� Dr. Prachila also said that during the special meeting held by the President on May 16 which addressed the dengue issue, he advised on the addition and constructing of new wings to the Kalubowila and Ragama teaching hospitals, with the intention of improving space facilities to accommodate the rising numbers of dengue patients. He also mentioned that schools premises too would have to be kept free of dengue breeding sites with proper maintenance. �Dr. Prachila further stresses that in order to reduce the number of dengue patients reported every year and thereby to reduce the death toll, it is of utmost importance to reduce dengue mosquito breeding sites. Dr. Prachila mentioned that the public should be ready to act and support the Health Ministry hand-in-hand in its efforts to reduce the number of people falling victim to the clutches of dengue.�Is there a change in dengue symptoms?In an interview Daily Mirror conducted with Professor Ranjan Premarathne, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya and Consultant Physician of the North Colombo Teaching Hospital, Prof. Premarathne revealed yet another twist in the Dengue situation.�He said some recent trends in the disease progression of dengue had been observed, which caused subtle changes in the clinical picture. ��No, symptoms have not changed. But we have observed some recent trends in the disease progression when compared to earlier,� said Prof. Premarathne. �The critical phase of dengue, also called the Leaking Phase, normally occurs after the third day ensuing fever, usually around the fifth or sixth day of the illness. However, there is an increasing number of patients entering the critical phase quite early after developing the fever. Such patients may show signs of going into the leaking phase as early as the third day since developing the fever. This is a condition that is common even in patients whose fever continues for more days than the expected time period. There is also an increase in the number of patients commonly known as �late leakers�. These patients may suddenly go into the critical phase despite not experiencing fever for a few days� he added. ���Speaking to Daily Mirror, Consultant Paediatrician at the Epidemiology Unit, Dr. Jayantha Weeraman said the subtle changes occurring in the disease progression pattern was due to a change in the dengue virus strain.��There are four strains of the dengue virus. The strains frequently seen in the majority of patients in our country were types 1 and 4. However there has been a recent increase in the number of patients being infected with type 2. This will account for the change in the clinical picture of the disease� he said. ��The general public has no cause to be worried, as the symptoms as well as the management plan of the disease remain unchanged. But the need for early hospital admittance should be highlighted even more.� �He advises any patient with fever to be cautious and to immediately go for a check-up if they experience any warning signs of dengue, as there is a risk that they may be going into a state of shock. �Warning signs of dengue are severe abdominal pain, continuous vomiting, drowsiness, restlessness, unusual bleeding like gum bleeding, nose bleeds, vomit the colour of coffee, unusual urinary bleeding or red urine and reduced urine output,� Dr. Weeraman added. �Advice to the community��I�d like to stress that the confirmation test for dengue, called the NS1 antigen test, is only valid if done within the first two days of the fever. If done later than that, the result will be negative even if the patient is having Dengue fever. After three days of fever a full blood count test should be done. It is the responsibility of the primary care doctor to prescribe the relevant test for patients with fever and direct the patient to a hospital if required. Many casualties of dengue could be avoided if these instructions are followed by the community, avoiding unnecessary delay in diagnosis.���The prevention of dengue in Sri Lanka is the most critical step that needs to be taken. The staff and hospital facilities are severely inadequate in managing the increasing number of patients, due to the heavy patient burden of dengue. With two, sometimes three, patients sharing the same beds in a ward, there is insufficient care given to each patient. As a result, attention given to patients with other illnesses has also dropped drastically. Therefore, it is the duty of the relevant authorities to prevent the spread of dengue by controlling mosquito breeding,� Prof. Premarathne concluded. �����",dengue

Listen to your hair - it talks,"2017-05-17 12:54:13							1						 				2442","A high chemical percentage in shampoos, conditioners, artificial foods, toxic lifestyle, stress and mental conditions are some of the most common causes related to thinning hair. Hair fall is a persistent problem for almost everyone today. Although it does not seem to be considered as a serious health issue, it is undoubtedly a problem most people seem to be grappling with. However if hair continues to fall in unusual volumes, it is certainly a red light demanding your attention. Abnormalities in hair growth as well as hair fall has also been linked with inner imbalances and some diseases. �Do you know that hair has a life cycle?�Yes, our hair has a life cycle! It passes three stages. Men and women both have this cycle with differences according to their gender, genetics and some other reasons.��	Growing pace - Hair grows	Resting pace - Hair stays on scalp �	Falling pace - Hair starts to fall out�Margin for normal and abnormal hair fallDr. Indira Kahawita, Consultant Dermatologist at the Base Hospital of Homagama believes that people easily misunderstand the hair fall levels. Their misunderstandings often cause them to demand for medications to treat their imagined hair loss. She emphasizes it is normal to lose some strands every day. �Losing 20 or 50 hair strands a day is absolutely normal and if someone loses more than 100 strands within a day, that is considered as an abnormal hair loss,� she said. She further noted that advertising concepts introduced by various hair care products have been successful in presenting this illusion. These advertisements often create the impression that hair fall is a serious issue and their products can help stop such hair fall. The Dermatologist also mentioned that no shampoo is able to stop hair fall as it is a natural biological cycle that the human body follows.�We also asked Dr. Kahawita on the most common reasons associated with hair fall.��DandruffDandruff is such a common condition that almost everyone has faced at least once in their lifetime. Anti dandruff shampoos, over the counter aids are helpful for a casual condition. However if the dandruff is becoming an issue, interrupting your day to day activities such as a development of serious itching, followed by pimple like blisters on the forehead, shoulders or behind ears, it is essential to seek medical assistance. Medicinal shampoos to ease this struggle will be prescribed by a dermatologist.��Fever�Dengue is considered a severe illness spreading all over the country at present. Dengue and other life threatening fevers too are responsible for hair loss. When the body is struggling a serious ailment such as dengue fever, all the energy in the body are purposely directed to saving the person�s life. This means that energy requirement for hair growth will take a back seat. Therefore, the blood supply to hair follicles is reduced and more hairs will start to rest (resting pace in hair life cycle). Losing 200 to 300 hair strands a day is normal during and after recovering from life threatening fevers. However after a duration of at least three months the resting phase of hair will conclude.��Severe mental stressDeath of a loved one, failing an exam or causes affect your mental peace can trigger severe stress, paving way for you to lose hair. Yet any of these abnormalities will be fixed naturally within 2 -3 months and hair will grow again following its natural paces.��Patchy hair/ Alopecia areataCircular patches with less hair compared to other parts are called Alopacia areata and this can appear in the beard, eye brows or any area of the human body where hair grows. This disease is connected with autoimmunity. Most of the people try home remedies for this disease. It is important to note that home remedies can worsen the condition beyond help. �Dr. Kahawita notes that those who suffer from this disease should never resort to home remedies.��Hair stylingRelaxing, perming and re � bonding, are only a few of the hair trends that are usually followed by males and females alike. It is not a secret that continous styling of hair would eventually weaken your hair making it brittle and dull. If anyone wants to style their hair, they have to follow hair treatments before and after styling or otherwise face the burden of damaged hair. ���MalnutritionNutrition plays a strong role in one�s hair growth. Therefore it�s necessary to have a balanced diet including vegetables, green leaves and fruits. Excess consumption of carbohydrates won�t give you the necessary nutrition.��	Some other causes for hair loss are:�	Low hemoglobin levels in hair	Heavy menstrual bleeding	Thyroid (Over active or under active thyroid gland)	Anemia �	Certain drugs used in treatments (Cancer etc.)�	Thinning hair�Both sexes face this problem, but in different ways. As men fear a bald head, women �losing hair on the top of their head. Such hair thinning is often the result of imbalances of male and female hormones. Women find these common, in reaching their menopause in their 40�s.�Hormone related treatments are quite expensive and difficult to afford. Hair transplant is the most expensive treatment and injecting hormones called HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) will lead to undesired side effects. We discovered that the medical brands available in Sri Lanka for such treatments are of exorbitant amounts.Dr. Kahawita observed that many children nowadays have thin hair in their frontal hairline. Keeping hair tight as buns, ponytails or other tight forms for too long can push their frontal hairline back.��Adore your hairApplying an oil is essential to keep dry hair moist and healthy. Coconut oil is an excellent oil which is easily available. Any oil used for hair treatment can be used based on individual preferences. Keep your hair relaxed for a certain period every-day, it needs the rest. Keep your hair protected from sunshine when outside.��",dengue

CAN Foundation calls for attitudinal change for conscious waste management at home,"2017-05-02 00:00:03							0						 				1000","Seated from left: Arun Dias Bandaranayake, Dilith Jayaweera- founder trustee of Sri Lankan CAN foundation, Sudesh Nandasiri- Chairman of Sri lankan recycles association, Prof. Ajith de Alwis- Director of coordinating secretariat for science technology and innovation, Randeewa Malalsoooriya- Charted environmentalist and council member of Environment professionals followed by president of eco-friendly volunteers, environmentalist Kanchana Weerakoon.�Being the pivotal hub of political, economical and commercial activities in the country, Colombo draws hundreds and thousands of individuals every day.�The statistics have revealed that the city which nestles 750,000 residents is visited by a staggering number of people amounting to 2 million locals and 250,000 tourists per day. In other words, at any given time Colombo is frequented by 3 million people, who unwittingly contribute towards an unforeseen menace - the surmounting garbage problem.With the sole aim of introducing a pragmatic and sustainable solution to the prevalent problem of surmounting garbage, Sri Lanka CAN Foundation conceptualized the initiative �Clean Lanka � Let�s begin from home�, creating a platform to cultivate individual responsibility to address the problem and raise awareness on conscious waste management starting from home.�It is common knowledge that improper disposal of non-biodegradable waste such as polythene and plastic waste cause severe environmental and health issues including the spread of communicable diseases such as Dengue, contamination of water sources, as well as affecting the wildlife populace in forest reserves bordering the main roads.�It is also a common factor that when the menace aggravates beyond a tolerable threshold, the state and the public institutions like the municipality and the urban councils come under a barrage of criticism from the general public, opinion leaders and activists. However, Sri Lanka CAN Foundation observed that despite the gravity of the problem, people tend to disregard the possibility of proactive individual contribution and its disproportionate impact in achieving a lasting solution. �Clean Lanka initiative motivates individuals to start from their very homes � the smallest nucleus in the society, triggering a chain reaction to disseminate the message from the family to the community, and school to the place of work. �Clean Lanka � Let�s begin from home� is mainly driven by the elements -refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and upcycle. �As a consumer, you have the right to refuse any additional shopping bags offered by retailers, by bringing environmental-friendly tote bags made of reed, straw or fabric material. Reducing makes you re-evaluate your daily requirements, where you can consciously drop the number of non-biodegradable items entering your home.�In addition, you also have the option to reuse items like shopping bags, lunch sheets or cellophane bags, which in turn would greatly help minimizing environmental pollution and waste disposal. You can also use a lunch boxes to pack lunch from home, and also use them in place of take away boxes and lunch sheets when buying meals from food outlets. And finally, with a home-made compost bin you can begin recycling from home itself, where all discarded food, vegetable and fruit peels, and even raked leaves can be all collected and converted to produce 100 percent organic fertilizer for potted plants and vegetable plants. Upcycling sparks your creativity to transform waster material to an entirely new material or product. Upcycled items such as jewellery, accessories, bags, baskets as well as bowls are gaining wider popularity in the contemporary market. ��Unlike other initiatives where an association or an institution takes the lead to implement a project, �Clean Lanka � Let�s begin from home� empowers citizens across the country, conveying the importance on individual responsibility and conscious waste management.�The initiative also aims to raise awareness on systematically managing household waste while greatly minimizing the garbage output.�Furthermore, steps are being taken to disseminate the message through all media including digital and social media. In conjunction with the initiative, discussions will be carried out by reputed religious programmes on people related and nation-benefitting actions that the society at large need to focus on for the greater good of humanity and the nation.�Sri Lanka CAN Foundation further believes their initiative will drive the entire nation towards a constructive and holistic attitudinal and behavioural change, striving towards zero-waste.�The inaugural programme of �Clean Lanka � Let�s Begin from Home� was held last evening at IdeaHell in Colpetty, with the participation of media, industry experts and intellectuals. Comp�red by Arun Dias Bandaranayake, the programme was enriched with a discussion partaken by several intellectuals and industry professionals including Prof. Ajith de Alwis from the University of Moratuwa (Project Director of Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation), Sudesh Nandasiri (Chairman of Sri Lanka Recyclers� Association), Randeewa Malalasooriya (Chartered Environmentalist and Council Member of Environmental Professionals), Kanchana Weerakoon (President of Eco-Friendly Volunteers, Environmentalist) and Dilith Jayaweera (The Founder Trustee of Sri Lanka CAN Foundation).�Ven.

Suren Cooke Agencies fights against deadly mosquitoes,"2017-04-19 10:02:46							0						 				656","�Suren Cooke Agencies, the pioneers in making the community a safer place to live, carried out a massive vector control campaign in several rural areas, to help people get relief from mosquitoes.Dengue is the most deadly mosquito-borne viral disease, especially confronting countries located within the equatorial region, having high temperature. Rainfall and humidity are conducive for mosquito breeding and migration that causes extensive transmission of the disease.Suren Cooke Agencies, the masters when it comes to the pest management industry in the country, extended its support to the �News 1st Gammadda� initiative in Thamaraville, Barathikulam, Faizal Nagar and Idiman fourth Div areas in Kinniya, Trincomalee, to carry out a successful vector control campaign using its latest equipment.�The two-day programme covered 14 schools in the four villages.Mosquitoes are known for spreading dangerous diseases like dengue and malaria, the main cause for deaths caused by viral infections all over the country.Suren Cooke Agencies used its latest product Pulsfog high output thermal fogging machines during the campaign, a method which proved to be an effective way of eradicating mosquitoes from a neighbourhood when a large area is concerned without undue harm to the environment.Unlike the conventional truck-mounted foggers, which were used for such operations in the past, the users of this Pulsfog thermal fogging machine can navigate into more confined spaces where conventional truck-mounted fogging machines cannot access, so it is far more cost effective and potable compared to its predecessor.Suren Cooke Agencies has always been in the forefront of the vector control industry and takes great pride in working on corporate social responsibility projects such as these.Suren Cooke Agencies works closely with government institutions to train the staff on the proper usage of the Pulsfog thermal fogging machines in their war against the deadly mosquitoes.Commenting on new advancements in vector control, of Suren Cooke Agencies founder Cooke said that they are currently in the process of further testing one of the latest products, the Sky Spray 1000 Copter, which will further reduce the time and manpower needed for such campaigns.��If you don�t keep innovating, you cannot make a real change and there is always a better way,� Cooke said.Since its inception in 1985, Suren Cooke Agencies has been in the forefront of helping the community in effective management of pests and also it imports and supplies pesticides, larvicides and equipment to government institutions, mainly the dengue control unit defence services, hospitals, anti-malaria campaign, provincial councils and non-government organisations such as the World Health Organisation and World Food Programme.�",dengue

This was in response to the Supreme Court order to come up with their project plans as solutions for constant garbage dumping at the above site in Kolonnawa. These facts were revealed by CMC when an FR petition filed by seven residents of the Meetotamulla area citing the CMC, UDA, Western Province Waste Management Authority, CEA, Kolonnawa MC and the Attorney General as respondents. At a previous hearing, the Supreme Court granted leave to proceed with this fundamental rights petition. The lawyer who appeared for the CMC informed Court that it had a solution to solve the issue including an arrangement to have the garbage taken to a 35-acre land in Ja-ela. The petitioners sought a declaration from Supreme Court that the proposed development of the dumping site was an impending infringement of their fundamental rights. The petitioner stated that Kolonnawa city particularly a high residential area with a thick population density, and lamented that in the centre of this highly residential area there was a huge and rising garbage dumping site, with a massive mountain of garbage, which had now developed to over 18 acres in extent. The petition state that approximately 750 to 1,200 tons of garbage from the Colombo city was piled onto this mountain on a daily basis and that the stench was now becoming unbearable for the families and children and that there is a significant and serious health risk. Around 30 people of the area had died due to killer germs, outbreak of dengue, kidney diseases, rat fever and skin conditions. �Thousands of others in the vicinity are affected and the number of affected are increasing daily. The petitioners complained that there were sustainable solutions other than the dumping of garbage in the above manner, which could bring an end to this crisis.

According to a former CMC official, the garbage disaster in Colombo began after 1977. The city began to develop fast and the low-lying areas used for garbage discarding were reclaimed. Low-lying lands in areas such as Kolonnawa, Mattakkuliya and Rajagiriya were used for garbage dumping. During the period 1998/99 under CBK, the World Bank was prepared to grant financial assistance to build a disposal site in Meepe in Avissawella. The cost of the project was estimated at Rs.800 million.This proposal was rejected by the then government citing various reasons such as the transport cost. (They said the �under-the-table� transactions did not meet the demand)! �Bandaragama model : They did it a decade agoBandaragama used to have the same garbage problem as Colombo. Its roads were strewn with garbage. According to the residents of Bandaragama, the garbage issue had been huge. In 2007, the Bandaragama Township decided to go green. The then Bandaragama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman, Lalith Ellawala kicked off a project to recycle garbage collected in the area. Technical expertise and direction were provided by the Solid Waste Management Authority, Western Province and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. Today, garbage has ceased to be a problem in Bandaragama. Instead, it has become a source of income. �How is garbage recycled?The recycling plant of the Pradeshiya Sabha occupies a small plot of land. It has 13 workers. About eight tons of garbage is collected from the town and brought to the place where it is sorted out. The biodegradable rubbish is allowed to decompose while the other collections such as polythene and plastic are sold to collectors. The plant needed only a smaller size backhoe (Bobcat type) machine to mix the decomposed garbage; the mixing is done by six workers and it takes a long time. They only have 13 employees to do the recycling work and if they have a backhoe machine, the workers will have more time. �Garbage is allowed to decompose for three months without any chemicals. They do not expose the garbage to sun. Decomposed manure needs around 15 % moisture. Once it is decomposed, it is then processed with the help of a mechanism which separates the dust. They collect the dust, packet it and sell. However, the PS noted that pubic cooperation was not at satisfactory level. There were two garbage dumps placed at many places in the town for non-decaying and decaying garbage but people dispose of their garbage haphazardly without caring to sort them thus causing hardships to the recycling workers. There is a good demand for the product. They plough back the income from sales into the plant. There are hundreds of birds eagerly waiting to eat the flies. Workers who reprocess garbage have small farms where compost made from garbage is used. They are also involved in animal husbandry. Vegetables grown from their plots are used for meals provided to workers. �The Solid Waste Management Centre at Bandaragama is admirable. Anybody can emulate it. In two years since its commencement in 2007 or by 2009, it had the expertise to provide its services to other local government institutions, though it was without space to expand its operations. With more facilities and space, they could expand their services to other parts of the country and help them overcome the garbage issue. ��",dengue
Mayhem Meethotamulla Garbage dump turns a deadly ground,"2017-04-17 00:45:18							1						 				3273","The destruction inflicted by the collapse of the garbage dump�Pics by Waruna Wanniarachchi�On the afternoon of April 14, tragedy struck Meethotamulla when most people were in their houses enjoying the holidays and festive bliss of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. The floor started vibrating and a mound of earth collapsed on them. Some escaped running for their lives. But some were stuck in the rubble and residents claim that despite the pleas of these victims, rescue operation were not underway until 2.00 am the next day. Twenty six people have died so far due to the collapse of a section of the Meethotamulla�garbage pile.The search continues�Victims devastated of a foreseen tragedy: Death toll reaches�26There were seven children among the dead. According to statistics gathered by residents, another 20 (probably) were feared dead and they also claim that as many as 60 people might have been stuck in the rubble. According to the police, seven victims are currently undergoing treatment at the Colombo National Hospital. ���The garbage started sliding at around 1.30 pm on April 14. Until 2.00 am the next day, though there were more than 500 Army and Police personnel, there were no lorries, excavator or any other vehicles to remove the rubble. In the interim, we heard people crying out for help. Others took shovels and tried to save lives. It was only at 2.00 am that people themselves decided to get the excavators from the depot,� said Nuwan Bopage, a lawyer and the organizer of the Movement against the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump. However, by that time he said that people�s cries could not be heard. When questioned by the Daily Mirror, V.K.A. Anura, the Commissioner of the Colombo Municipal Council said he was unaware of it and declined to comment further adding that the CMC has done whatever they could since the tragedy struck. The CMC is currently providing food, clothing and other essentials to the affected people and they are financed by the Council. ��Speaking to Daily Mirror, the Commissioner of the CMC added that currently around 79 families were displaced and 263 houses would be removed. He said according to the geologists, that the collapse occurred due to heavy rainfall. ����When asked if the tragedy was not foreseen, he said that the residents had been asked to evacuate from the area. �Some had left while some stayed back. We gave them a monthly assistance of Rs.15,000 for six months, so they could rent out an alternative abode, pointing out there is a risk of this nature when there is a heavy rainfall,� he said. ��Since 2011, the Movement against the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump has organized more than 15 protests but to no avail. �Both the previous and current governments turned the protesters away by using tear gas at us and baton charges. The same police and Army men who suppressed us then are now here to dig out the buried bodies of our children and our people,� said Bopage. ��He believes that there has been an alleged deal which bartered their lives for the benefit of politicians. �The CMC had allegedly given the Rs.600 million tender at Rs.800 million and shared the Rs. 200 million among themselves and the politicians,� he charged. ��Bopage added that in February 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promised to solve the issue within six months, but no recourse was offered. Meanwhile, the PM has issued a special statement expressing regret over the incident adding that plans and actions to remove the garbage dump were underway though they were not operational. ��Devastated by the unbearable loss of lives and property�Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva in a social media post said it was ironic that �only a few weeks ago, agreements were signed to convert waste to energy projects to finally deal with this perennial issue�. �No more garbage will be dumped at this site and two temporary sites were identified this morning for which law enforcement officers would provide access to unblock protesters driven by petty political issues,� the post read. ��The post further noted that payments had been made for those families under risk of landslides to move out, but some had not done so. �They had even been advised to leave as recently as two days ago,� it said. But residents said they were never asked to leave the place. ��However, Bopage said that even if they were asked to leave, it was not possible, as the houses built were the result of the endurance of the people and were worth their lives� earning. �Five generations of people have lived here and they have land ownership deeds. These are not illegal constructions. It�s not that we decided to house ourselves near a garbage dump, but it was they who decided to dump garbage near our houses,� he said. He asserted that their persistent struggle was never to quit the place but to remove the mountainous pile. However, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) has advised to relocate 130 houses situated near the Meethotamulla garbage dump. ���Two years ago also there was a risk of around 300 houses facing collapse. Then they were offered Rs.1,500,000 and the residents left,� he pointed out. ����He further said that though 60 organizations submitted reports to solve the issue, authorities did not accept any of those proposals. ���Politicians who turned a blind eye to this issue should resign. No divisional representative wanted to solve this issue. They gained political benefits out of this, and our children have paid the heavy price for this,� he stressed. ���If another garbage truck arrives, we will burn down both the lorry and the driver. We warn politicians not to come here to shed crocodile tears,� he said.�The bodies of the daughter, son-in law and granddaughter of Keerthi Rathna Perera, the convener of the Movement against the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump who worked tirelessly for this cause, were dug out. His wife has been paralysed below the hip, he added. According to him, devastated residents angered by the garbage collapse have set fire to an earth mover at 5.00 pm, on the day the tragedy took place. ��Dudley Danthanarayana, who has been a resident of Kolonnawa since 1968 said that by 2.00pm houses seemed to be flying. �My house, a huge two-storyed house, is now 50 metres away from where it was. We were just about to have our lunch, but had to grab the hands of our children and run for our lives clad in sarongs. My vehicles were also destroyed,� he said. ��He said that though he has taken part in discussions with the CMC Commissioner and MP S.M. Marikkar, no solution was offered though he had warned them of an impending tragedy. �I asked them for a solution over and over again, but they remained silent,� he said adding that they were never asked to leave the area. �����The CMC has given the tender to a private company to dump garbage here which was not merely collected from the 15 zones of Colombo. Four trucks registered with the private company come from Matugama,� said a resident, while another added that there were trucks coming from Homagama, Padukka and Peliyagoda. �The garbage of the whole of Colombo district is dumped here for money! We hope the Supreme Court will give us a justifiable solution,� he added. �According to reports, the Meethotamulla garbage dump is 180 feet in height and contains approximately three million tons. 700 to 900 tons of garbage is collected from the Colombo city daily and dumped here. He further stated at the press briefing held in February that a staggering 1,000,000 tons of garbage was collected from all parts of the country and brought to Colombo, which was ultimately dumped at Meethotamulla. ��Hemamali Abeyratne, an activist fighting against the dumping of garbage at Meethotamulla said that their first protest as a movement was in 2011, held near the Meethotamulla depot and lasted for four consecutive days and prevented garbage trucks entering.��But the then rulers used the Army, Police and the STF to chase us away. Our people were beaten and hospitalized. Garbage trucks were parked on the road and we were unable to enter. The government suppressed us by using their power and weapons. Villagers were beaten, scolded, and they even tried to bribe the villagers. Those buried are our children, parents and elders. Who will take responsibility now?� she lamented. ��When the Daily Mirror visited the area on Saturday, the pathway that led to the garbage dump was flooded. Distressed and angered residents stood on the sides. From close proximity to where the tragedy struck, we were told that the rubble before us had covered a road completely.��The Dahampura road is 40 to 50 feet below the rubble,� said Bopage. He added that the area we stood was elevated by 40 feet as a result of the force exerted by the massive slide. Pointing at a house partly destroyed, he said that a child who lived there died of dengue two weeks before. Houses had collapsed completely and trees were uprooted. While we were talking to them, several backhoes were seen removing the soil.���""Currently around 79 families are displaced and 263 houses will�be removed.""��Since 2005 people have been visiting us but no relief was offered,� said a weeping Kanthi Kannangara, whose house was built on a block of 15 perches of land which has been completely destroyed by the incident. �The army and the police were very helpful,� she added suppressing her tears. ��Sri Rahula Vidyalaya, situated near the garbage dump is now converted into a centre to obtain information from victims. It is a combined effort of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the CMC. Terrance Vidyalaya provides temporary shelter to those who were displaced and currently there are around 75 families seeking shelter while other have sought shelter from neighbours, friends and relatives. According to the Ministry of Defence website, a contingent of Army troops from the 14th Division of the Security Force Headquarters - West (SFHQ-West), the STF and the Disaster Management Centre are involved in relief operations. Further, an Air Force helicopter was utilized to control a minor fire that broke out after the incident. It was also reported that the Japanese government promised to send a team of experts to provide relief. ��A man who has been living in the area since 1988 said that garbage was dumped in smaller volumes in the area since 1983. �When garbage from Colombo was dumped, we protested and then they shifted the place to Bloemendhal, where another conflict took place. Then they started to dump them here once again forcibly. This�was in 1994.� �In a nearby three-wheeler, a woman was weeping while two women were seen offering solace to her. Perhaps she had just understood or seen a loved one dead, or had her house completely destroyed. But the tears she shed were reflective of continuous negligence by successive governments, and the price they ultimately paid and may continue to pay if the authorities do not bring about a permanent solution. � ���A dead body in the rubble unearthed",dengue
Kim�s nukes warms Asia,"2017-04-17 00:40:51							0						 				2044","As Sri Lankan�s enjoyed the festive season last week, from policy makers to media personalities voicing thoughts of optimism, about reconciling, peace, communal harmony the week saw a major shakeup in the global security situation. The aftermath of Trump�s tomahawk strikes on Syria shook the already fragile global security kaleidoscope, leaving pieces in a flux.�How they settle down seems to be a puzzle no one is capable of responding. The North Korean Leader in his New Year address of 2017 promised to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) to hit American targets by the end of the year. The recent escalation of tensions between the United States and North Korea is unfolding as a fast developing threat concern for all Asians and Pacific states. ��The American military has suddenly started flexing its muscles in ways that many did not anticipate in a Trump era. President Trump seems to be shedding his pre election promises and positions at light speed. Many were of the view; his transformation is unprecedented for any president. Analysts called it the death of America first policy and a rebirth of neo conservative interventionism which operates at a global level but with no real consultation with any global partner or forum. �With a US carrier group heading closer to North Korea, and its leader threatening a nuclear attack on any adversary, Asia�s security concerns seem to be intensifying. America helmed by a leadership that is leaving a scorched earth policy in dealing with enemies and North Korea with a leader displaying clear signs of power consolidation from using assassins to take out political rivals to executions of family members who threaten his authority. ��Trump did a U turn on his fiscal allegations on China, which were also a key campaign promise and a key feature in his very concisely articulated foreign policy. He earlier called China a currency manipulator and last week decided to ditch that line of thinking. He also did a complete u turn on his statements on NATO during the presidential campaign calling the post world war II alliance as obsolete; again last week he debunked this view of the alliance. Sri Lankans are used to politicians� flip-flopping, it has been a mainstay of policy statements and promises that has become common sense knowledge of being not followed up but we had not witnessed advanced democracies with leaders in such manifestations �North Korean under Kim Jung Un, the grandson bearing Kim il Sung�s legacy seems to be unleashing all sorts of aggressions from ordering a sequence of nuclear missile tests, unveiling new rocket engines and even unveiling planned cities and keeping up with the rhetoric of challenging his adversaries saying that he will use nuclear warfare as a deterrent.���""During Chinese President Xi Jingpin�s visit to the United States, the Americans have managed to get his consent on possible use of force against North Korea, as the Chinese leader himself had felt all other efforts seem to have not worked""�There was a key underreported fact during the transition period in the United States following Trump�s electoral win. By late November 2016 President Obama highlighted his administration�s concern about the fledging nuclear program of North Korea and its increasing capabilities to hit United States and many other states across the Asia pacific. Obama was clear when he told Trump that by late 2016 the North Korean nuclear threat constituted the top national security priority of the United States. This revelation also marks the failure of the Obama administration�s non-military efforts such as sanctions against North Korea and its own coming to terms about the need for a military response.�President Trump has also been upping the rhetoric on North Korean since becoming President along with his key cabinet members. Trump�s recent tweet �North Korea is looking for trouble� could have been ignored till two weeks ago. But since his cruise missile strike on Syria and then last week when Trump authorized what international media reported as the mother of all bombs to be dropped in Achin district of the eastern province of Nangarhar in Afghanistan targeting a tunnel network used by Islamic State militants stunned security analysts.The bomb is the second largest non-nuclear bomb in the US military inventory called GB 43B which packs 11 tons of explosives and is what the military calls a thermobaric incendiary weapon.���""Trump did a U turn on his fiscal allegations on China, which were also a key campaign promise and a key feature in his very concisely articulated foreign policy""�Meanwhile, Kim unveiled an ultra modern housing development project in Pyongyang along the Ryo Myong street, a lane apart from where the mausoleum for Kim�s grandfather Kim Il-Sung and father Kim Jong-Il lie. This was a build up to April 15th the 105th death anniversary of Kim�s grandfather the founder of modern North Korea. Kim staged a massive military display, where he promised to respond to any military aggression in kind. The news reaching from the American side is that during Chinese President Xi Jingpin�s visit to the United States, the Americans have managed to get his consent on possible use of force against North Korea, as the Chinese leader himself had felt all other efforts seem to have not worked. It is still hard to accept that China would be a part of any military strike on North Korea given the fall out it would have on China and the region. �The immediate effect will be on South Korea, any military engagement that North Korea is involved in will have a significant impact on South Korea which is going through a lengthy internal political crisis of its own. Ever since the impeached president Park Geun Hye�s suspension last year, and following political and economic turmoil in South Korea with the arrests of Jay Y. Lee the vice president of Korean electronics giant Samsung and its apparent heir, analysts claim that the North Koreans managed to use this instability to their own advantage.���""The bomb is the second largest non-nuclear bomb in the US military inventory called GB 43B which packs 11 tons of explosives and is what the military calls a thermobaric incendiary weapon""�Sri Lanka�s strategic security posture did consider the nuclear armed rivalry between India and Pakistan, yet the nuclear weapons themselves played a similar role like in the cold war to keep the peace between the two rivals. Thus our concerns of fallout from a nuclear conflict have been minimal. The current tensions between Korea and the United States fall outside of the strategic calculus of military nuclear deterrence. Both countries are endowed with political leadership that seems to give less regard to global norms, governance procedures of international security strategies. Sri Lanka strategic policies, forums and security interests have been around the Indian Ocean region security concerns. ��Whilst the Indian Pacific ocean systems are now considered by India, United States and China as a strategic zone the fallout from military especially nuclear tensions needs to be addressed by our own policy makers, think tanks and the highest political leadership. Our basic nontraditional security consensus is still in a flux with dengue outbreaks, viral flu, drought management which are in essence national security concerns managed with a lack of strategic insight.�One can ask what if there is a nuclear war, or even a non nuclear military conflict in Asia Pacific how will Sri Lanka react? How we will deal with the aftershocks �with �the security or strategic calculus that we have? To end a column with a question mark may not be prudent but these are real issues to ponder after a heavy and lengthy festive break. �The writer is the Director, Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS)",dengue
The Politics of garbage and the need for recycling plants,"2017-04-17 00:32:33							0						 				2861","If a country is not able to manage its own garbage, that creates serious questions about its citizens� discipline, respect for natural environment including protection of animals - even though people are highly educated or with high literacy rates. Sri Lanka is no exception to this case.On 14th April 2017 the Sinhala and Tamil New Year day, so far 16 people have died, many people were injured and over one hundred houses were destroyed or damaged due to a collapse of a section of the Meetotamulla garbage dumping site (garbage mountain) where the entire Colombo district garbage is currently being dumped; so far around 23 million tonnes of garbage has been dumped at the site.�People of the area have protested since the beginning of this garbage dump but the authorities did not listen to them or take necessary action. This story reveals that Sri Lanka is still unable to manage its own waste, which is generated at local, provincial and national levels.�There were several mega development projects carried out at various government levels in the past but no government was able to think of a lasting solution for the waste management issue in Sri Lanka. It seems that even with the current government there is no political will to find a lasting solution to the waste management issue or for immediately setting up a recycling plant for the Colombo district as a high priority.���From time to time several so-called experts recommended to the authorities that people should separate garbage before they handed it over to respective local authorities. Even if they handover separated waste to local authorities do not have proper facilities to dispose of garbage or other means to process garbage in a recycling facility.�The non-availability of garbage or solid-waste recycling facilities in Sri Lanka has created serious issues relating to health, environment as well as socioeconomic and political concerns. Dumping waste on open dumping sites impedes water-flow in drainage channels and provides breeding places for dengue mosquitoes and rats. In most of the open garbage dumping sites, animals such as elephants, cows and other animals eat garbage which includes polythene. This causes severe health hazards for animals. �Open burning which adds several chemicals into the air and rising temperature (fuel global warming) is imminent. Some waste is dumped in water bodies, low lands and sometimes into the sea. Another serious issue relates to hazardous, electronic and other industrial waste and this includes oil and waste water management since very meagre facilities are available to recycle such waste in Sri Lanka. ���In most countries garbage is turned into various recycling products, which generate renewable energy, fertilizer, employment opportunities, and overall waste management is seen as a profit making entity. From household levels people separate garbage, people put their garbage into relevant garbage bins on the streets provided by the authorities; institutes, business and industries separate their waste according to the waste they produce. In Sri Lanka, except in a very few industries, the entire nation�s waste has been dumped on open landfills, into water bodies and the sea or burnt which causes and creates serious issues for the human, animal and natural environment.�Australia�s population of 24million generates around 45 million tonnes of solid waste each year (according to Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006-7) which is recycled the same year at their recycling plants. Australia treats the recycling sector as an important aspect of Australia�s economy and society.���""People of the area have protested since the beginning of this garbage dump but the authorities did not listen to them or take necessary action. This story reveals that Sri Lanka is still unable to manage its own waste, which is generated at local, provincial and national levels.""�As the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities of Australia pointed out in 2013, a strong and sustainable recycling sector is essential for Australia to utilise resources more efficiently and maximize the full value of materials. ��Sri Lanka�s population is approximately 21million which generates 2.3million annually (6,400 tonnes of solid waste per day according to Ministry of Environment - 2013). Compared to Australia, Sri Lanka produces a tiny amount of solid waste but is still unable to manage it. Solid waste continues to accumulate every year and pile up in garbage mountains. Sri Lanka could seek local and international support for immediately setting up a recycling plant for the Colombo district as a high priority to mitigate this burning issue and gradually expand it to other main cities where the waste management situation is serious. Recycling plants can be set up as Public Private Partnership (PPP) which will directly and eventually allow people to live in a waste-free healthy environment. �If there is a political will, Sri Lanka will find a lasting �solution for the garbage issue. �Waste management is not a rocket science any more in the world today. � �We have seen that various government institutions, the corporate sector and development sector have been involved in finding a solution to the garbage issue in Sri Lanka but unfortunately the setting up recycling plants was not seen in their discussions for unknown reasons. There was a plan to build an electricity plant that could transform solid waste into fuel. When will this become a reality? ��Past and present governments, the donor community and corporate sector must have spent billions of rupees for various solid waste management projects and those funds were wasted. But the question is did any of them spend a single cent and think of having proper recycling plants for Sri Lanka? Was this ever discussed at Cabinet level or at Parliamentary level? �If the garbage issue is not addressed in Sri Lanka without delay, several garbage mountains apart from Bloemendhal and Meetotamulla will arise. Their regular collapses which cause serious damage to people and threatens their lives, will also lead to overall loss of biodiversity, contribute to global warming and climate change. No country can match Sri Lanka�s natural beauty, but its beauty is daily dying mainly because its� own people and institutions� failure and inability to manage waste, and not caring about the natural environment.�",dengue

The region is already burdened by diseases like tuberculosis, HIV and malaria.�Examining the vulnerability to emerging and growing infectious disease threats and the capacity to respond to outbreaks, the analysis finds the level of preparedness is inadequate to protect public health,� it said.The analysis also pointed out that although sporadic cases of dengue infection were seen in many South Asian countries in the 1960s, regular epidemics only occurred in the early 1990s in India and Sri Lanka.�In India and Sri Lanka, by around 40 years of age 90-95% of adults have been infected with the dengue virus, while 41% have been infected with chikungunya,� the analysis found.It said while noting that anthrax is endemic in large parts of South Asia, that in the border areas of India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, poor vaccination and surveillance have been accompanied by increasing anthrax cases, which prompted Bangladesh to announce a red alert in 2010.Noting that rabies remains endemic in eight countries in South East Asia, with 1.4 billion people at risk, the authors in the analysis said that the region contributes about 45% of global rabies deaths, while the rhetoric on elimination continues to grow.�Brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, and a range of food-borne diseases contribute to the morbidity and mortality attributable to zoonotic infections but are struggling to gain the attention of policymakers in the subcontinent, despite it resulting in 150 million illnesses, 175,000 deaths, and 12 million disability-adjusted life years,� the analysis said.The analysis found that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus A/H5N1, which was introduced to the subcontinent in 2005 through wild birds, has since become endemic across large parts of northeast India and Bangladesh, across porous international borders.South Asia is defined by the World Bank as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and is home to a quarter of the world�s population.(Hindustan Times)",dengue
Dengue on a dangerous rise,"2017-04-12 00:11:11							0						 				1485","The rising menace of Dengue and the plight of the IDH Dengue Management UnitWitnessing a significant rise over the past couple of years, Dengue has become a rising menace in Sri Lanka with the eradication of mosquito breeding grounds appearing to be a losing battle under the current context. With over 30, 486 cases being reported over the past three months, Dengue has become a widespread� epidemic with approximately over 41. 10 % cases being reported from the Western Province alone. Speaking to Daily Mirror, Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Consultant Physician Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama explained the crisis Sri Lanka is facing with regard to Dengue fever; while explicating on the symptoms and precautionary methods the public could employ in the event someone contracts the disease. He highlighted the plight of the Dengue Management Unit of IDH,which is currently run by a shortlisted and overburdened nursing staff. He also pointed out the immediate need to absorb more nursing staff to the hospital complex.� �Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama The rising trend�During the dry period of February and March, the number of mosquito breeding grounds is minimal due to less water collection in the environment,� said Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama. He pointed out that during the monsoon season, a high number of patients were being admitted to IDH.�Based on statistics available, a gradual increase has been evident since the last couple of years in the number of Dengue patients reported countrywide. We simply can�t imagine to what extent this situation would increase by May and June. We had more than 25,000 cases on Dengue fever reported with more than fifty deaths.� ��Generally, there are four types of Dengue viruses identified. Throughout the last five years, Sri Lanka has been affected mostly by Dengue virus serotype 1. To make matters worse, this trend has been gradually replaced by Dengue virus serotype 2 since mid-last year.�Compared to last year, the number of cases reported this year has increased twofold. This year, the Colombo District had about ten thousand cases and more than sixty per cent of them were admitted to IDH. The involved number of Dengue patients daily for treatment at the Infectious Diseases Hospital is nearly 200 while the number of admissions is around 80 -100 daily,� Dr. Wijewickrama said.� ���""We simply can�t imagine to what extent this situation would increase by May and June. We had more than 25,000 cases reported on Dengue fever with more than fifty deaths""�He said despite experiencing a drought in February, Sri Lanka also experienced several episodes of rain. This is one possible trend that has given rise to the increased number of Dengue cases over the past couple of months. Moreover, he noted that the mosquito eradication programmes run throughout the country should be continued without failure. Adding that the public should also play a proactive role in eradicating Dengue breeding grounds, he said it was crucial to ensure� garbage disposal was done in an intelligent manner.� ��The symptoms of Dengue are mainly fever, severe head and body aches. A patient may experience loss of appetite, nausea, sore throat and mild loose motion. These symptoms observed in an individual could lead to the possible suspicion that the patient is diagnosed with Dengue. A physical test is important to ascertain if a patient is diagnosed with Dengue fever or not. Secondly, Dengue patients should not be administered any pill except Paracetamol in case they experience fever, bodyaches and pains. Pills such as Diclofenac, Ibuprofen and Mefenamic acid should not be given to a Dengue patient under any circumstances. If a patient is suffering from fever, we strongly recommend that they do a full blood count at the end of three days, and if the report is positive, the patient should seek immediate medical advice. In case the first blood count report is normal, a second full blood count should be taken the following day regardless of whether the patient is experiencing fever or not. Such patients need to take ample rest while ensuring that the aforementioned drugs are not consumed.�� Most people suffering from Dengue fever are unable to eat due to the illness. However, it is vital that fluid intakes are given to patients to keep them hydrated. King coconut water, orange and lime juice, cunji, soup and Jeevani are generally recommended for this purpose. Also, it should be noted that apple juice is not going to have any special effect on the patient. Liquids like king coconut are comparatively a lot more cost effective and efficacious on the patient than apple juice. The common complications of Dengue fever may include plasma leakage and bleeding. If the bleeding is significant, it could eventually lead to the damage of vital organs in the body,� he added.� �Plight of IDH Dengue Management Unit� �According to Dr. Wijewickrama, Kolonnawa and Dehiwela were hotspots with the highest number for Dengue patients and Dengue breeding grounds reported during 2009, 2010 and 2011. It is in this backdrop that it was decided to initiate a separate Dengue Management Unit within the hospital. The unit was initially established with sixteen beds for each patient and as the number of patients grew, the number of beds increased to twenty.� ��When we started getting more admissions for Dengue fever, we were compelled to put the patients in other wards as well. Finally, we decided to admit only the serious cases into special ward and patients who were not critical were sent to other wards. Also, a new ward built by the Army was recently added to the hospital complex to treat residential Dengue patients. It accommodates about twenty five beds. Unlike in the past, we now get too many critical cases and are compelled to accommodate two patients in each bed in the Dengue Management Unit due to lack of beds. Therefore, we currently face a serious shortage in the number of beds available for patients in addition to being short staffed,� he said.� ����We are facing a serious problem due to the lack of sufficient nursing staff. The hospital is therefore facing a big crisis.The Health Ministry fails to take note of these problems. Lack of nursing staff is not a problem that is confined to this hospital only. However, considering the number of patients admitted to the hospital daily, our hospital is in dire need of more nursing staff. There is a group of nearly thousand nurses waiting for new appointments from the ministry. According to the ministry, these appointments were scheduled to be given on April 9. But, the ministry has taken lenient measures and have agreed to let them officially join duty after the New Year.�The nurses who are already employed here have been working very hard despite being overburdened. We have been trying to convince the Health Ministry about getting these new appointees to officially join our hospital before the New Year,� Dr. Wijewickrama added.�In a final note, Dr. Wijewickrama noted that he expected the ministry would change its perspective on this matter and provide a favourable solution to address crisis faced by the hospital and its staff.���",dengue

Leo Burnett�s Lalindra Nanayakkara shines a light on the art of Typography,"2017-04-05 14:56:09							0						 				1134","Leo Burnett Sri Lanka�s Executive Creative Director Lalindra Nanayakkara (fondly known as Nana), recently participated in a three-day typography workshop that was conducted by a world-class panel under the auspices of the University of Moratuwa and was attended by a cross section of participants ranging from industry professionals, designers to under graduates and art students. The event brought together top advertising and literary professionals from across Sri Lanka and the region, to highlight the important role that typography plays in modern-day communication. �A series of case studies, seminars, lectures and reflections were shared to educate the participants on how they can make better use of typography, understand its roots, apply it in their academic studies and professional careers, and truly understand the technical aspects involved in the art of typography.�At the typography workshop, Lalindra highlighted examples of exceptional typography led campaigns that have been created for Sri Lankan brands. Lalindra is a renowned communications professional, with a career that spans across 18 years. He has worked with some of Sri Lanka�s leading advertising agencies and corporates and his work has won numerous accolades at some of the world�s most recognized award shows. Having conceptualized several award-winning campaigns for leading local and global brands such as UNICEF, KFC and Jetwing, he has also applied his astute copywriting skills, creativity and leadership to add immense value to brands such as Toyota, �Coca-Cola, Minute Maid, �Dialog, Sri Lanka Telecom, Mobitel, CJS, Sri Lanka Insurance, Elephant House, People�s Bank, Cargills Magic and many more brands. Prior to rejoining Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, Lalindra worked as the Head of Branding and Communication for Sri Lanka�s largest company,MAS Holdings,which has a global operationacross 16 countries, a staff force of over 86,000 people and an annual revenue of USD 2 billion.�Commenting on the key cases he covered at the workshop Lalindra said: �I shared some interesting pieces of work with the students and highlighted that typography can actually become the core element in a creative idea. My presentation reiterated that instead of just using text for a headline or as accompanying copy, typography can be used to drive an entire campaign or concept.��Further elaborating on this he said: �One example of this is how Leo Burnett Sri Lankacreated �Shree� a new brand with a distinct Sri Lankan flavour for Cotton Collection. For this brand of products, we used the entire Sinhala alphabet to convey the essence of the product in a way that made it more relevant for people. Another interesting typography campaign we did was for the Mawbima Newspaper, which was based on using text to drive dengue prevention. It�s a very powerful example because in this particular instance, the text was used to literally save people�s lives. Another example I shared was how the Puswedilla series invented a hybrid language called �Arstalk� to convey comical anecdotes and ideas with added humour. All of these cases were well-received by the audience, who were able to see that companies like Leo Burnett use typography as a design element in its own right and are therefore able to maximise its potential to communicate an idea with simplicity, effectiveness and power.� �Highlighting the importance of the workshop Lalindra said: �This typography workshop was the first of its kind to be held in Sri Lanka by the University of Moratuwa and more than 350 people participated in it. Many guest lecturers and participants from other regional countries also attended the programme. It was a proud moment for me to see Sri Lanka at the forefront of such an important communications event. This workshop was of an international standard and I hope that it will play an influencing role in encouraging more youth and young professionals to embrace the value of typography and consider careers in advertising. Programmes of this nature also give us an opportunity to showcase the world-class creative ideas and campaigns that we have executed as an agency over the years, we are also able to impart our knowledge to the next generation of creative leaders and hopefully draw them to our industry.�",dengue

What your nails say about your health,"2017-03-15 15:50:06							0						 				5720","�Nails are not just a surface reserved for decoration. Experts can find clues to internal abnormalities and diseases just by detecting the texture, colour, shape and overall appearance of nails. Problems in the liver, lung and heart could be detected by signs in nails. ��It is always a good habit to take care of your appearance. That�s why you should check for changes in your skin and nails constantly. ��What are nails?�A horny sheath protecting the upper end of each finger and toe of humans and most other primates.� - Merriam - Webster Dictionary ���How should normal nails look?�Usually pinkish, smooth surface and with a healthy glow ���Good habits for healthy nails�	Use a personal nail cutter ��	Cut nails often.

In chronic situations such as kidney diseases, nails look more whitish. Fungal infections are also responsible for yellow nails. Smoking stains also appear. Nail polish too can cause this. ��Nail Clubbing - Nails bent at the edge - loss of normal angle in the nail bed is the reason for this condition. The tips of nails are swollen or bulging and curve downward. ��White spots - Small white patches on nails - Children enjoy these as they think they signify new friendships. They are normal on children�s nails. ��On some occasions, certain types of medication for diseases like cancer are also responsible for dark pigmentation of nails. Skin pigmentations could differ and lead to spots. ��Ridges - Vertical lines occur due to age. Only horizontal ridges need attention. On a few occasions, these horizontal ridges may indicate situations like heavy metal poisoning. ��Brittle nails - Common among people with dry skin. It�s advisable to apply moisturising creams like Aqueous cream on the nail and the nail folds. ��Dark bands - Small vertical lines in darker tone - Longitudinal dark bands are common in dark-skinned people. At other times they are caused by Melanoma, skin cancer, which is a rare condition. ���Beau�s lines - Horizontal lines on nail ��These may occur following a serious illness which puts a strain on the body�s resources. Nail growth slows down during the illness and later appear as horizontal lines on the nail. Foot and mouth disease and Dengue fever are two examples. ��Nail pitting - Small pits in nails - They are common in conditions such as Psoriasis and look like scaling. It is normal for nails to look irregular when people have eczema. ��Viral warts - warts appear around the nails and spread to adjacent areas. This needs quick medical attention or it will spread and destroy the nail. ��Paronychia - Nail fold starts swelling � this occurs when inflammation takes place in the nail fold. Exposure to excess amounts of water, detergents and soap may lead to this. In addition to medication, measures to minimize exposure to water and detergents are necessary to cure this condition. ��Pale nails - whitish nails due to lack of blood circulation - this pallor is common in Anaemia and malnutrition. ��Lifting nails (Onycholysis) -nails look separate from the nail bed - they are lifted upward from the nail bed. An aggressive manicure, nail hardeners or glues could also cause damage. If the nail colour has also changed to opaque white, green or yellow, this could point to everything from a thyroid disease or psoriasis to injury and infection. � �",dengue
Are we hit by climate change?,"2017-02-20 00:02:24							0						 				1041","SL experiencing climate change effects, says Sir Robert Tony Watson The global climate will change in the present century swiftly at rates unprecedented in recent human history. The risks associated with these changes are real but highly variable. Societal vulnerability to the risks associated with the climate change may exacerbate ongoing social and economic challenges, particularly for those parts of societies dependent on resources that are sensitive to changes in climate. Risks are apparent in agriculture, fisheries, tourism and many other areas that are critical to the livelihood of both the rural and urban populations especially in developing countries such as Sri Lanka.�""�All countries do suffer from climate change as it affects physical systems including the coral reef system, rainfall, rivers and lakes. However, when you consider the situation in Sri Lanka, it could be observed that the island is vulnerable to climate change. ""�Sir Robert Tony Watson is a British chemist who has been described by the New York Times as �an outspoken advocate of the idea that human actions�mainly burning coal and oil�are contributing to global warming and must be changed to avert environmental upheavals,�.� �During his recent visit to Sri Lanka he expressed his views with the on climate change, its consequences and how it affected the world and Sri Lanka in particular. He has worked on atmospheric science issues including ozone depletion, global warming and Paleo-climatology since the 1980s.He was the former Director of the Science Division and Chief Scientist for the Office of Mission to Planet Earth at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). �Excerpts: �What is climate change? �Over the last 100 years or so, people across the world have released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and they have changed what we call �radiation balance� or �atmospheric temperature.�As a result of this immoral practice, we have seen changes in the temperature, precipitation patterns as well as the sea level. This is climate change. �How has it affected Sri Lanka? �All countries do suffer from climate change as it affects physical systems including the coral reef system, rainfall, rivers and lakes. However, when you consider the situation in Sri Lanka, it could be observed that the island is vulnerable to climate change.The most recent example that could be drawn is the drought that severely affected the whole of Sri Lanka. The country also saw the sea levels rise every now and then, thereby causing saltwater intrusion. �We also monitor changes in commodities like agriculture-based products. The current drive in Sri Lanka is having adverse impacts on paddy fields, and is giving a second chance to dreadful maladies including Dengue and Malaria to raise their ugly heads. �On a different note, we should also discern that Sri Lankans have a responsibility to protect its treasured forests and other natural resources.The people should care for agriculture, coastal draws, and natural habitats and especially be conscious about conserving water as all these elements directly or indirectly impact on climate change. �As a scientist, how do you view the eco-system in Sri Lanka? �Sri Lanka is undoubtedly battered with a massive drought. When I toured the Yala National Park a fortnight ago, I was disappointed to see the tanks drained. We cannot, however, infer that this drought situation is solely due to human-induced climate change; although it significantly contributes to the cause. Anyhow, we should expect similar and much more destructive droughts in years to come.It is now high time to think of an effective and long-lasting mechanism to conserve water as it affects the eco-system in Sri Lanka. �As global warming is considered an alarming situation, in your capacity, what do you recommend as safety measures to protect our nation from this danger? �I believe that all countries fall victim to human-induced climate change; the poor countries suffer the most. We see developed countries equipped with technological, financial and institutional capabilities to address climate change. In the Sri Lankan context, the main weakness I see is that the people fail to manage the freely-available water system. They should assure that water is not wasted. �The people of Sri Lanka should give serious thought to means of managing one�s agriculture, cropping and shifting into the right crop, rising sea levels, putting up seawalls, retreating land of the seabed and so forth, as they determine to what extent climate change affects the island nation. �We now find climate adaptation funds in abundance, which Sri Lanka could benefit from. Sri Lanka should improve on the efficient use of energy. The people should utilise the specified equipment and other apparatus in construction and transportation industries. Further, Sri Lanka should reap the harvest of technological advancements -- people should concentrate more on cost-effective channels of using renewable energy and what we call �modern bituminous.� So what Sri Lanka needs to do is to reduce earth�s gas emission. �How can the public and private sectors contribute to save the green? �In my opinion, it is imperative that the administration works closely with the private sector. Climate change could be addressed only if the government puts in place apt policies, follows effective procedures and enforces stringent laws. It should encourage renewable energy and water resource management in agricultural practices. Then, the private sector will see opportunities in establishing advanced energy and irrigation schemes. Thus, both sectors will collaborate to mitigate climate change. It�s a win-win situation. �You reiterated many a time that humans were instrumental in causing climate change. Why? �Well, as individuals, all of us can use our energy more efficiently to deal with climate change. The public should push the government towards real action, and the industries towards �sustainability.� �As individuals, we can save energy, water and other valuable resources. We should exert pressure on the government and other responsible governing bodies for this worthy cause. The media would undoubtedly be an effective channel of approach. The people should be made aware of the subject and its consequences. They should know how destructive it could get if this practice was to continue. As I mentioned earlier, climate change is human-induced. Hence, the human race does not merely have a duty but a responsibility to resolve this dilemma. �Finally, what is the message you wish to convey to the world? �I would say climate change is a very serious issue that could affect everyone. With the height of technology, we surely have what it takes to address, or at least to limit, climate change. Thus, we should utilise renewable energy and adapt to climate change thereby managing water, agriculture and coastal zones more effectively.����",dengue
Papaya  leaf  extract as a Dengue cure?,"2017-02-17 00:19:29							0						 				9367","Sri Lanka is no exception where, dengue infection is a priority for the national health services for prevention and reducing mortality. In desperation, many people have resorted to use papaya leaf extract covertlyWhat is this hullabaloo, to say it in colloquial terms about eating leaves. Did Dr. Rohan Wijekoon say the leaves should be eaten raw - No. He wanted the tender leaves cooked or in a form that is eatable. There is nothing wrong, because according to my grandmother, during the 1800�s severe drought, the yams of water lillies were boiled and then tied around the waste and then when they were hungry, these boiled yams were eaten �Over the years leaves have been part and parcel of the life of rural Sri Lanka. There were Home gardens in practical every home in rural areas and they partook the leafy vegetables from these gardens. Even manioc leaves are dried for a day and then cooked for a meal. They have been used as medicinal herbs as well. So we now come to Papaya tested out now as a remedy for Dengue. �There is now an on-going investigation on leaf extract from fresh Papaya for hematological parameters and toxicological changes for treating Dengue. ��This question was touched at a � Workshop on Dengue � organized by the Faculty of Medicine, Peradeniya. This was in collaboration with � Centre of Research in Tropical Medicine �. ��For two hours experts in the area of Dengue spoke at the Senate Room of the University of Peradeniya. Their opinion was that Dengue would have in most people, but it is the serious ones that has come out into the open.The speakers were Dr. R.M. Abeyratne, Professor Ms.F. Noordeen, Dr. Udaya Ralapanawa, Professor Ananda Jayasinghe and Dr. R.M. Mudiyanse. ��In 2016, there had been 54,945 cases reported while only 75 have died. It was pointed out that most would be having the disease and would have overcome even without their knowledge. Professor Ms.F. Nordeen spoke on the research conducted and that this has been conducted on Dengue at the Faculty of Medicine in the University. �The research on Papaya extract was carried out by a team, Sinhalagoda Lekamlege, Chandi Asoka, Dharmaratne, Susiji Wickramasinghe, Roshia Waduge, Jayanthi Rajapakse, and Senanayake Kularatne.�The study was to evaluate the effect of hematological, biochemical and toxicology changes in mice after the administration of papaya leaf extract, as one of medicinal plants which has been used worldwide as a remedy food, cosmetic and widely cultivated around the world. �People in rural areas have used papaya leaf, as an alternative to treat dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever. They believe this plant�s leaves can increase the platelet level of dengue patients shortly after receiving juice boiled or raw of the leaves, says the researchers. �The researchers in their comments say that it is an interesting study of the effect of papaya leaf extracts. The finding are also impressive, they add, would be useful for continuous study related to papaya leaf, which could be an alternative to treat dengue and malaria fever instead of prescription drugs. �The Papaya plant is laltiferous as it contains specialized cells known as lactifers that occur in most tissues and secrete latex. Lactifiers secrete latex and are dispersed throughout most plant tissues. The Papaya-latex is well known for being a rich source of the four cysteine endopeptidases namely papain, chymopapain, glycyl endopeptidase and caricain. Leaves contain an alkaloid called carpaine and a glucoside named carposide. Different parts of the papaya plants including fruit, dried fruit, leaves, dried leaves, stems, seeds and roots have long been used as ingredients in alternative medicine. For instance, the seeds are used for expelling worms and roots and seeds are used as an abortifacient agent. The leaves (especially fallen ones) are used variously for the treatment of fevers, pyrexia, diabetes, gonorrhea, syphilis, inflammation and as a dressing for septic wounds. ��Untested herbal medicines could be potentially injurious to human health. Many plants used in traditional and folk medicines are potentially toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. Toxicological studies of extracts from different parts of papaya plants such as seeds, fruit, roots and leaves have been carried out using several animal models. Acute and chronic toxicities of unripe fruit of the C.papaya have been documented. Some of the traditional claims of efficacy that have been investigated scientifically using animal models and their efficacy have been proven. Recent studies showed that C.papaya leaf extract has potential anti- sickling (inhibition of sickle cell formation) properties. Indran et al. have shown that there is a protective effect against gastric ulcers in rats. Moreover, C.papaya flowers are known to have antibacterial activities[15]. The contraceptive efficacy of the seeds of C.papaya has been earlier demonstrated in rats, mice and rabbits. Oral administration of C.papaya seed extract could induce reversible male infertility and could be used for pharmaceutical development of a male contraceptive. ��Today, the researchers say, many tropical and subtropical countries are engulfed by dengue infection which is caused by viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family. There is no specific therapy for dengue even though the infection has a significant mortality. Sri Lanka is no exception where, dengue infection is a priority for the national health services for prevention and reducing mortality. In desperation, many people have resorted to use papaya leaf extract covertly. This is applicable even to hospitalized dengue patients. However, recommending C. papaya leaf extract for dengue infection is unethical until it is proven by scientific research. Therefore, in the present study, we have investigated the effects of oral intake of pure extract of C. papaya leaves on haematological/biochemical parameters and toxicological changes in the murine model. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental animals Male white mice (average body weight 32-33 g) 6 weeks old, obtained from the Medical Research Institute, Sri Lanka were used as the model for haematological and toxicological investigation.�Animals were kept in the animal house of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya. Three experimental trials were conducted during May 2011 to May 2012 using three sets of mice. Mice were divided into two groups, control and test, in all three trials. For the first and second trials, we used 48 mice (for each trial 12 mice/ control and 12 mice/test) and for the third trial, 36 mice were used (18 control and 18 test). All mice were given a standard commercial diet with free access to water. All mice in both test and control groups were numbered by ear tattooing. The first trial was a pilot study to plan a proper study where the following variables were considered-dose of C. papaya leaf extract, timing of blood sampling and histopathological changes in liver. The second trial refined the methodology and the third provided the results presented here. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethical Review Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. �The research is ongoing at the Faculty of Medicine and Veterinary Science of the University of Peradeniya on Dengue. �",dengue
Kireizuki approach to quality and productivity,"2017-02-06 10:49:07							0						 				1824","�The Japanese are known for their obsession with cleanliness. They are also known for their high quality and productivity. There is obviously a connection.�Kireizuki is a Japanese term which closely translates to the high level of cleanliness and an almost obsession with it. Chinese historians who visited Japan in the third century as well as European visitors who arrived when Japan opened up in the 16th century have commented on the fastidious Japanese where cleanliness was given the highest priority. Even Sri Lanka had a glorious sanitary system in the past as far back as the Rajarata civilization. However unlike the Japanese who kept on improving their standards of cleanliness we in Sri Lanka have seen a drastic deterioration. We are only left with historical artefacts to prove that once, a long time ago, we were a clean and hygiene conscious nation.�We even arranged for Queen Elizabeth to see the ancient toilets slabs during her visit to declare open the Victoria dam. It was as if to say, even though the country is filthy dirty now, we were more advanced than you in 500 BC. �We need to face reality and not fool ourselves. We are not a very clean nation. We do not have a culture nor do we have social rules that promote cleanliness. Historical records indicate our advanced sanitation systems and high standards of cleanliness of the Sri Lankan royalty, and there is an abundance of evidence of the precise vinaya rules for the monks.�There is no dearth of concepts nor profound proclamations about the need for cleanliness, but the actual practice is far from those abstract concepts. It is said that even Kautilya�sarthashastra had many concepts and rules for cleanliness. Kautilya has been widely studied and discussed in India and even in Sri Lanka. However Kautilya�s thoughts on hygiene and cleanliness do not appear to have made much impact on the Indian or Sri Lankan cities.�This proves the point made over and over again that South Asians are very good at conceptualizing and theorising but hopeless at implementation. I have been speaking about this, and writing about this, since 1980 when I first visited Japan and saw at first hand their cleanliness culture. When I returned I tried my best to implement some of these methods at the Sri Lanka Tyre Corporation where I worked as the Industrial Engineer in late 70s and early 80s.�I failed miserably. I only succeeded in getting my office cleaned �the Japanese way� as my colleagues called it, and it became a big joke to everyone. However in every organization I was the CEO I was successful in drastically improving the standards of cleanliness. After over 30 visits to Japan since then, I once again visited Japan at the end of last year and decided to write�this piece.�Attitude in Sri LankaI had learnt the Japanese 5S system in Japan and was the first to conduct seminars and promote this concept since the 1990s. When I took over as Chairman of Dankotuwa Porcelain Ltd and then the Japanese investors came in after �peoplisation� I had just started implementing 5S there. I still recall the conversation with the Japanese technical expert who had been in the factory for few months before and who very bluntly told me, that I may succeed in the first two steps of 5S but will miserably fail in the third step, which is mostly about cleanliness. On challenging him, his reply was that �Sri Lankans believe that they have a fundamental right to dirty the workplace and get workers, janitorial services, peons and servants to clean up�. He gave loads of examples to prove his point. He had once found a dirty piece of cloth on a machine and asked the factory manager about it, and the Factory manager called an Assistant Production Manager to attend to it, who called the supervisor who called his Charge Hand and finally a factory worker removed it. He may have exaggerated this a bit, but made his point. Next he took me into his office, sat down, wrote something on a piece of paper with a pencil and then erased it, collected the eraser dust off the table onto his palm and dusted into the waste paper basket very neatly. He looked up at me and said �That is Japanese method�. Then he took me into the general office and asked me to observe, at which point someone was just erasing something he had written. He erased, lowered his head towards the paper and blew away the erased dust across the table onto the floor. �That is Sri Lankan method� said the Japanese Expert, adding �you expect someone else to clean your mess, because you think it is your birthright to mess up your workplace�.Once a team from Sri Lanka was on a productivity and quality observation mission organized by the German GTZ. We were in Hanover, in an apartment hotel. One day there was a suggestion to cook a Sri Lankan dinner organized by a good cook amongst our team members. We cooked Sri Lankan food and after an enjoyable evening in his room and when we were breaking up I suggested that we all get together clean up the room and wash up the utensils before we head back to our own rooms. The organiser protested �Our room charge includes cleaning up so we just leave things as they are.� I was aghast and asked him �how he could possibly sleep with bits of curry spilled on the writing table and blobs of seenisambol on the floor etc. He was quite happy to sleep with all that mess because �we have the right to dirty the workplace�.�This is the problem with us Sri Lankans. This was quite in contrast to the philosophy of the Japanese. Once a Japanese Director told me how he won a competition in school and the prize was �the golden opportunity to clean the school toilets�. I am not joking. Japanese schools usually do not have janitorial services, the children clean the school themselves. In Sri Lanka a child will never be asked to clean a toilet even as a punishment. The difference is that we think it is our right to dirty the workplace while the Japanese believe it is bad manners not to clean up and keep the place clean and neat for the other person.Once a former boss of mine who had retired from the then Ceylon Civil Service told me how he refused to give an extension to an officer who never kept his institution�s toilets clean. He said whenever he visited the Institution he was greeted by an unbearable stench emanating from the toilets. On hearing the news that his extension was not approved, he had confronted the boss and asked why he did not get an extension and was promptly told the reason. In disbelief he had asked �What do you mean clean sir? They are toilets no sir�.�My boss explained to me that to many Sri Lankans a toilet is considered an excellent toilet only if it smells to high heaven, with water splashed everywhere, and generally filthy. If not, it fails to qualify as a �good toilet�. When I took over as Chairman of the ETF the toilets at the entrance were smelly and dirty, the office was disorganized and unclean. I had the whole place cleaned up and floors polished, and introduced potted plants decorating the place. Although petitions went to the Minister that I was wasting ETF money the staff soon became cleanliness conscious and maintained the office very well. Some even told me that they are so proud of the office when their friends visit them. I distinctly recall the incident when Hon Aboosally took over as the new Minister of Labour and visited the Labour Department and the ETF, which are housed in the same Labour Secretariat. He was very impressed with the cleanliness of the ETF and asked why the Labour Department could not be kept equally clean. The answer was that since most people who come to the Labour Department are floor level workers with some workplace issue, such as a dismissal, and therefore in a distressed state of mind, it would make them feel far more comfortable in a dirty smelly environment! Once again I must say I am not joking, it is a true story.Relationship of cleanliness with quality and productivityIt is obvious that breakdowns are far less if machines are kept clean and well maintained. Japan boasts of having one of the lowest breakdown rates in the world. The Japanese philosophy is to bring back to original condition every piece of equipment at the end of every day. This applies to large machines and even to your personal equipment kept on your table such as calculators, mobile phones, and even paper punches. It�s not just the breakdowns only, because poorly maintained machines will turn out defective products lowering quality yields and machines that do not perform at the rated output levels will lower your productivity as well.There is a definite direct correlation between a well maintained workplace or factory and a higher quality yield.Personal hygiene too can have a significant impact on quality and productivity as demonstrated to me by a Japanese expert. In the porcelain industry the factory has to be very clean because if iron particles (which may not be visible easily to the naked eye) rest on the item before it is fired it will end up with a black spot, easily visible, after firing, and it therefore becomes a rejected piece. Workers had been asked to regularly wash their hands with soap before they handle products before firing, but the problem still persisted. The Japanese expert then decided to visit the toilets and observe how workers washed their hands.�To his horror he found that the steps were as follows; with dirty hands they open the tap, wash, apply soap, wash again and close the tap. What happens?The dirt on the tap comes back on the clean hands. In Japan,said the expert,school kids are taught to wash their hands properly so that they take water to their hands and wash the tap before touching the tap again to close it. He was surprised that we do not teach our children in Sri Lanka how to wash their hands.Instituting a cleaning cultureAlthough there has been a remarkable change in attitudes in Sri Lanka over the past few years, we need a massive change to come upto world standards. Many years ago if a worker from Telecom came to your house to install a telephone he would do his job and depart leaving all the mess behind. Cleaning is someone else�s job.�Today it is much better. A person who came to install a shower cubicle in my home recently cleaned and vacuumed the entire area before leaving. A person who came to fix a wall bracket had an innovative method of holding the vacuum cleaner near the drill while he was drilling so that the plaster and brick dust arising from the drilling was immediately sucked in to the vacuum cleaner. Hopefully things are changing. One important aspect of the Japanese concept of cleanliness is �clean in one step rather than with two or more steps.This concept was first driven to me during my first visit to Japan in 1980. The programme included �home visits where we had to visit a typical Japanese family one afternoon, spend the evening with them, and have dinner. For the two of us Sri Lankans It was a wonderful experience. The day before we left Japan this family visitedus in our hotel and brought along with them some typical Japanese fruits. We sat in the lobby and they brought out the fruits on a plate and the knife to peel and cut the fruits. Before anything else they took out a small garbage bag and made it sit on the table with the open end in an open circle. They peeled the fruits straight into the garbage bag, so that there was no need to put the peels on something else and then collect and put into the garbage bag subsequently. It was a single step cleaning.Generally in Japanese cities today, it is hard to find garbage bins because garbage is your responsibility, and you are supposed to take the garbage home. Once when my son and I visited the �touristic city of Nikko he was wondering why there were no garbage bins anywhere, only to realise the reason when we arrived at the bus station when we saw everyone carrying their own garbage back home.Five minute SEISOOne of the recommended methods under the third step of 5S, Seiso, is cleaning your own workplace for 5 minutes at a designated time every day. At this time everyone gets up from their seats and will first arrange their tables, tidy things up, clean their own desk, chair, computer, cupboard tops etc with a cloth and other cleaning equipment such as brushes and leave everything spick and span. This will inculcate a self-cleaning culture. Today many garment factories that practice 5S have inculcated these good habits to their workers. They wash their own plates and mugs and clean the table so that �a janitorial service is not required. Even the Managing Director follows the same routine. In Sri Lanka we desperately need to take away the stigma attached to cleaning by yourself.The Castle Street Maternity Hospital was one of the pioneers to practice the Japanese 5S method and they proved with statistical data that mortality rates reduced and rate of infection reduced. Once I took a team of Indian senior managers there and they were astounded by the standard of cleanliness and were surprised that there wasn�t a single fly to be seen. This only proves that we can do it with good leadership.Machines that are not cleaned will break down more often, produce defective products and work at a slower rate. Homes, schools, and workplaces that are not hygienic will cause more disease. Even the dengue epidemic currently prevalent in Sri Lankan cities could be brought under control if we follow the Japanese practices. Let us emulate Japan and make our country the cleanest at least in South Asia.(Sunil G Wijesinha was the first Sri Lankan to be awarded the prestigious National Award by the Asian Productivity Organisation (APO) for promoting productivity in Sri Lanka, and later the only Sri Lankan to be awarded the Regional Award by the APO for promoting productivity in the Asia Pacific region. He is the most well known promoter of Japanese Management techniques in Sri Lanka and recognized as the pioneer in introducing Quality Circles and 5S to the country. He is a consultant in Productivity and Japanese management and is on the Boards of several listed and unlisted companies)",dengue

Efficacy of any medication should be proved by  control experiments,"2016-12-21 00:00:23							0						 				970","Recently, the Daily Mirror published an article on an Ayurveda physician, Dr.D.D.A.Hettiarachchi who claimed he could cure dengue. Authentic Ayurveda inarguably contains healing properties. However the lack of research has underscored the value of Ayurveda.We spoke to two medical practitioners on their opinions on the efficacy of such treatment. They asserted that the proposed treatment should be clinically and experimentally proven to establish its efficacy and to protect the lives of patients who may otherwise contract unexpected and at times life threatening illnesses. ��Dr. Sarath Hettige- Specialist in Family Medicine�You have to be open minded; it could be true or untrue.�Dr. Sarath Hettige, a certified specialist in Family Medicine who discovered and proved the efficacy of the papaya leaf extraction in treating dengue said that instead of criticizing,the public should be broad minded to review proposed theories. ���You have to be open minded; it could be true or untrue. I am an MBBS doctor too. The only way to prove that an Ayurveda medicine or any medicine is efficacious is to conduct a control experiment. You have to divide a group of people into two factions. You administer this medicine to one group and not give it to another. At the same time the usual dengue guidelines should be followed. This was what I did to prove the efficacy of the papaya leaf extraction,� said Dr. Hettige who won the Presidential Award for the best medical invention for 2013 this year. ��Dr. Hettiarachchi�s treatment includes an ointment applied on the head and ears, and a decoction to drink made with a powder, a piece of papaya leaf and king coconut flower nectar. �Papaya leaf is definitely efficacious. There is no doubt about that. There are more than 20 randomized control trials done all over the world. We did a trial at the Kalubowila Hospital,� said Dr. Hettige commenting on the ingredients of the treatment. However as the ingredients of powder have not been disclosed he could not comment further. ��When asked if he thought that �any dengue patient could be cured within 18 hours� as Dr. Hettiarachchi claimed in his interview with Daily Mirror, Dr. Hettige replied in the negative. �You can�t cure dengue within 18 hours. You have to first do the NS1 antigen test to diagnose dengue on the first day. Then you should give the papaya leaf extraction on the first day itself. Most people get cured within three to four days and they don�t need hospital admission. But curing dengue within 18 hours is quite implausible,� he said. ��Suggesting that Dr. Hettiarachchi should conduct clinical trials to prove the efficacy of his treatment Dr. Hettige said, �You can�t gauge its efficacy by giving the medicine to one or two people. The research could be done in an Ayurveda hospital. But dengue patients don�t seek treatment from Ayurveda doctors. Therefore this doctor should link with a western doctor and conduct a trial. He should get ethical clearance, state what the ingredients are and the toxicity of the powder. There is a long process to follow. � ���At a time when there was no cure for Malaria, Malaria patients were dumped in a jungle where one man consumed a piece from the cinchona bark when he was delirious. He got cured. Consequently quinine was discovered. Most of the western drugs stem from Ayurveda. But you need proper clinical research,� he noted. ��Dr. Sarath Amunugama- Deputy Director General of Health Services�According to western thinking we will not administer such a treatment unless it has gone through the process of verifying its efficacy.�Commenting from the perspective of western medicine Dr. Sarath Amunugama, the Deputy Director of Health services said,�Perhaps he is able to cure dengue according to Ayurveda. However in western practice if we are to say that something is efficacious there is a long process to follow. You need to analyze the components. Trials are conducted on animals and then there are small scale studies with people. If there are no complications further trials are conducted under the supervision of an independent body. It is only then that they decide to administer it to human beings. Unfortunately here we have an Ayurveda physician claiming to cure dengue. I can�t say if it�s true or not. According to western thinking we will not administer such a treatment unless it has gone through the process of verifying its efficacy.� �He added that Dr. Hettiarachchi should conduct trials and reveal the scientific document stating the details of the trial so people could be aware of what he has done. �When asked about how the Ayurveda doctor could conduct a research as he had claimed that the lack of funds prevented him continuing his research at IDH on HIV, Dr. Amunugama said, �I don�t know how he approached the Ayurvedic department. The Ministry of Health which Ayurveda falls under has enough of funds. They should not be concerned about funds. They should apply through the Ayurveda department.� �Stating that there was no treatment available to kill the dengue virus and cure the patient in western medicine Dr. Amunugama said, �Around 90% of dengue patients get cured without treatment. In hospitals we monitor the patients to see if there�s any bleeding or leakage through repetitive full blood count tests and other investigations. We treat the complications. We can�t kill the virus because there is no such treatment.� � �",dengue

This is not a new disease. It has existed in the past, as far back as B.C. 92 in ancient China. I have come across it in ancient books as �Break-bone� fever. The ayurvedic name for Dengue is �Dandaka fever� - as it hurts like being beaten from a batton. I have also treated many patients with Dengue symptoms in the past, before the society even came up with the term. By now, I have been treating Dengue patients for nearly 15 years. Some people have natural antibodies against Dengue, but some do not. Western medicine doesn�t have a cure for the disease, which is why it is considered lethal. But there are alternatives like the treatments I give. I have cured western doctors too. However, decent western doctors admit that Dengue could be cured with ayurvedic medicine. Some of them have even sent me patients they failed to cure,� the doctor commented.�I can cure any Dengue patient within 18 hours. I have held discussions with many ayurvedic and western doctors regarding my treatment, but they come to a halt after the directors and authorities attempt to snatch my secret formula, which they are determined to have. Using my know-how to treat Dengue-inflicted patients is not their focus. I reiterate, Dengue is curable. I don�t want to affront any medical tradition, what I do and want to do is to heal patients. I am ready to face any challenge in the context of curing Dengue patients. The malady should be managed well and it cannot be done by staying at home; it needs the caring of a hospital as doctors and nurses do the necessary blood tests. Dengue is a virus and there are no cures for viruses in western practices. People are hurt by various diseases every day because they give up medicine and the traditional way of life,� Dr. Hettiarachchi added.Many tourists have come to him seeking a cure for their diseases, especially HIV and other STDs. He is treating an HIV-infected person in Botswana by sending her the required medicines on a monthly basis. He has patients from countries like Germany and USA, and most of them have requested him to work abroad, but he wants to remain in his home country and serve it to the best of his ability.Dr. Hettiarachchi has been visited by a number of patients including military officers, doctors and lawyers. He has many reports requested from the patients related to various stages of sickness.The treatmentDengue treatments should be carried out within 18 hours. There are only two medicines to provide - an ointment to be applied on the head and ears, with a powder to drink mixed with a piece of papaya leaf and king coconut flower juice.

He was hospitalized in IDH for six days. His blood count dropped and he had begun to bleed internally. Doctors had given up on him and it was a visitor to the hospital who told us about Dr. Hettiarachchi. Later, my husband visited the doctor and he was given the medicine. Just one hour after applying the given oil, my son was able to urinate after it being blocked for hours. Although my son bled inside hours ago, soon after the treatment, he showed signs of recovery. Within only two days, his blood count returned to the normal state, bewildering all doctors. As my sister�s son was also affected with Dengue, he was given the same treatment and he too recovered,� she said.History of Dr. HettiarachchiDr. Hettiarachchi was a student of the Hiththatiya Gunarathna Mudalinda Pirivena, the first Pirivena in the South, where he learned traditional ayurvedic medicine. He later schooled at Kajjuwattha weda walawwa. Those two places were leading institutes for training traditional ayurvedic doctors at that time.Cures for HIV/ HerpesDr. Hettiarachchi had conducted a research on HIV at the IDH Hospital only to be interrupted halfway due to lack of funds. He claims that he could cure HIV and many other STDs. According to him, the HIV germ activates three to four months after it first enters the body, and later, detectable side effects appear. If patients come for treatment before the germ activates, he says with eight, 10 or 12 months of treatment, the patient could be cured. If the ELIZA test results negative two or three times, the disease is believed to be cured. He has completely cured eight patients suffering from HIV and nearly 75 patients with Herpes.A cured Herpes victimA patient found to be a Herpes victim underwent three years of medical treatment before he came to Dr. Hettiarachchi.�I came to Dr. Hettiarachchi four months after the disease was detected. Now I am having treatment for two years and nine months. My reports show negative results now,� he said.Eternal cycle of diseasesCommenting on diseases and related consequences, the doctor said: �Diseases cannot be eliminated forever, as being sick is an eternal cycle. Diseases spread and deplete from time to time. There are antibodies for sicknesses, but there are times when we cannot fight with internal antibodies only. We should always be on guard against what is known to be bad. People should be satisfied with what they get, without running after for more than they have. The more you chase things, the more misery will you have to face. Most of the people who come to me with social diseases are either married but looking for sexual pleasure out of the family or had sought sex at a very young age.��The government officials are not cooperating and the government is not considerate of my research work, treatment or the yeoman service I render to the needy. Once I informed the former president about my efforts, and as a result, former Director of the Bandaranaike Memorial Ayurvedic Research Institute Prof. K.K.D.S. Ranaweera had several discussions with me to do a research at the IDH Hospital with the Dengue team there, but the discussions didn�t turn into a research,� the doctor said.Prof. K.K.D.S. Ranaweera - Former Director of Bandaranaike Memorial Ayurvedic Research Institute, Maharagama�It is difficult to prove Dr. Hettiarachchi�s medicine scientifically, and the reports he have cannot prove the miracle of his medicine. We discussed about him with our doctors, as there are people like that everywhere. We were also willing to help him even though we were a little suspicious about him. Therefore, we asked him to bring the patent of his finding. But, he never did so. Actually we don�t believe it as a successful treatment, and he is somewhat afraid of being robbed of his formula. We informed him that if he could prove the validity of his treatment, there was no rejection from us. We cannot be satisfied with the method he claims to have used to save Dengue patients. His medicine should start from the first detection of a Dengue patient and be measured with before and after progress. Sometimes, Dengue gets cured even without any treatment. But, I do not reject his cure out of hand. He and many other people who claim to have found a cure for Dengue expect sudden recognition from us. If we give that kind of recognition to anyone, it should happen with a scientific reasoning and systematic research,� the professor said.Commenting on his skills and experience, the ayurvedic doctor said: �Many helpless patients are deceived by dishonest ayurvedic practitioners who charge huge sums for treatment. Now I am 70 years old, and I want to do as much service as I could to cure patients before my demise. I request the government, the directors of the Ayurveda Medical Council and all those who are responsible to use me for the well-being of the ill.

Ranaweera - Former Director of Bandaranaike Memorial Ayurvedic Research Institute, Maharagama��It is difficult to prove Dr. Hettiarachchi�s medicine scientifically, and the reports he has cannot prove the miracle of his medicine. We discussed about him with our doctors, as there are people like that everywhere. We were also willing to help him even though we were a little suspicious about him. Therefore, we asked him to bring the patent of his finding. But, he never did so. Actually we don�t believe it as a successful treatment, and he is somewhat afraid of being robbed of his formula. We informed him that if he could prove the validity of his treatment, there was no rejection from us. We cannot be satisfied with the method he claims to have used to save Dengue patients. His medicine should start from the first detection of a Dengue patient and be measured with before and after progress. Sometimes, Dengue gets cured even without any treatment. But, I do not reject his cure out of hand. He and many other people who claim to have found a cure for Dengue expect sudden recognition from us.

Achieving inclusive health in Sri Lanka through SDGs,"2016-12-14 00:00:07							0						 				2142","The global development framework has evolved to be more inclusive beyond 2015, with the integration of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in economic, social and environmental aspects. �Health� with regard to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), takes notable recognition in linking to the goals in the sustainable development agenda.�It is well known that Sri Lanka is placed much ahead in terms of health outcomes compared to the neighbouring countries. However, regional disparities remain. This is further aggravated by the demographical (health of ageing population) and epidemiological transitions, as well as the country�s move towards a high-income level. �Conversely, financial insecurity when it comes to seeking care has arisen because of public health services that are inadequate in quality and quantity. This in turn has created an increase in out of pocket expenditure. In this context, the emergence of the sustainable development agenda, subsequent to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), with a comprehensive and exclusive goal for health opens another window to set the newest targets and respective actions towards UHC.�SDGs on Health� is antecedent�but divergent�Subsequent to the MDG agenda, the 17th anniversary of the UN Assembly embarked on a new vision, which is the 2030 Agenda for SDGs. This �introduced 17 goals and 169 targets, of which, Goal 3 comprising �nine sub-goals and four implementation goals are assigned for health with an aim to �ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages� (Figure 1). So far, more than 15 indicators are identified to measure the outcomes of the set goals.While the MDGs were exclusively framed to strengthen human development, SDGs go beyond this, capturing a wider spectrum on economic, social and environmental dimensions. This integration is the key to making health in SDGs critically different from other development agendas. One can argue that the first three SDG health sub-goals (Figure 1) are to continue MDG targets further. This is correct, as the said three sub-goals still exist to point out the crucial areas of a country�s health outcomes.�The focus of SDGs is not limited to diseases. It also sets insistent targets towards reducing inequity in health within and between societies, with an emphasis on UHC, which identifies the determinants of health within and beyond the health sector. As such, SDG 3.8 on �achieving universal health coverage� is a platform, which incorporates all other sectors, reinforcing the existing approach on �health in all policies�.Making commitments towards UHC via SDG is commendable but it can only be successful if the following two factors can be accomplished. Firstly, UHC can be achieved once the dimensions of health service coverage, financial protection and population coverage are cumulatively addressed. Secondly, intersectoral collaborations/actions with other SDG goals, namely, poverty reduction (Goal 1), provision of water and sanitation (Goal 6), urbanization and service delivery in human settlement (Goal 11), provide a perfect complement towards achieving UHC.�Besides, the SDG agenda has explicitly stated the need to take steps towards ensuring equity by phrasing that �no one will be left behind�. The SDGs have also envisioned addressing health system issues in terms of supporting health research and development, increasing health financing, strengthening human resources and increasing capacities for risk reduction and risk management through �implementation targets�.�Relevance of SDG 3 to Sri LankaWithin the South Asian region, Sri Lanka�s health system has been well ahead to sustain the basic health outcomes. This is also highlighted in the third MDG report. However, the country still needs advanced interventions to smoothen the drive towards basic health outcomes. For instance, Sri Lanka has already met the universally agreed upon SDG targets in terms of maternal mortality, neonatal mortality and under five mortality. However, these targets are only being achieved at national level and regional disparities persist.�As such, the continuation of MDG health targets through SDG 3.1 and 3.2 are still pertinent. Even though Sri Lanka is free from a few infectious diseases (e.g., malaria, filariasis), some of the diseases, particularly HIV, dengue and TB are on the rise. Accordingly, SDG 3.3 on infectious diseases can still contribute to Sri Lanka�s health sector improvements, towards implementing target-oriented interventions to combat such diseases.�NCDs and mental health issues are on the rise and are the leading causes of deaths in Sri Lanka, accounting for 75 percent of all deaths, while 14 percent of deaths occur due to injuries. Meanwhile, Ischaemic heart disease has become the leading cause of hospital deaths in the country. Further, premature mortality � deaths between the ages of 30 and 70 � stands at 18 people out of 100 in the country.�Moreover, mortality due to NCD is projected to increase in the coming years with high exposure to NCD risk factors (i.e., exposure to agricultural and industrial chemicals, unhealthy food habits, use of alcohol and tobacco) despite demonstrating a relative reduction in the previous years. To combat the said epidemic, the country has already taken measures by implementing a NCD National Policy and �National Multisectoral Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2016-2020�. Therefore, SDG 3.4 � 3.6 and 3.9 can complement the national initiatives on NCDs, which can then accelerate NCD prevention and control.SDG 3.7 on �ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services� is already consistent with Sri Lanka�s national targets. To this end, it is crucial to give priority to reducing teenage pregnancies, unsafe and illegal abortions and increasing contraceptive prevalence rate.�An inadequate and inequitable public health service is one of the crucial factors, which create inequity in health outcomes in the country. Such a situation then impels people to seek alternative healthcare services, particularly by moving towards the private health sector. A majority of people does not have health insurance and pay for the services out of their pocket. �Meanwhile, a majority of the people is financially insecure and that is further underlined by the high rate of out-of-pocket expenditure on health (OOP). Besides, inequity in health outcomes is also persistent. Accordingly, ensuring equity in health outcomes is pivotal for Sri Lanka and which can be addressed by the SDG on UHC.Preparing for a new global agenda�is a challengeTechnically, there is no doubt that SDG Goal 3 is relevant to Sri Lanka. However, Sri Lanka has the responsibility of making adjustments to SDGs to suit the country but within the given framework. It is important to form an institutional mechanism (apex-body) with a strong political commitment, which can ensure effective planning, implementation and monitoring of SDGs.�The SDGs should also be prioritized to be aligned with national health policy initiatives through proper financing estimates and monitoring and evaluation systems at regional and national levels. Importantly, setting up a coordination mechanism between health and beyond the health sector is vital to ensure that overlaps and duplications do not occur.Next, the biggest bottleneck is finding financial, physical and human resources and employing them in an effective and efficient manner. The estimated cost for achieving SDGs, particularly in developing countries is in the range of US $ 3-7 billion per year and every year a gap of US $ 2.5 billion remains. However, a clear funding source has not been identified. Even for Sri Lanka, increasing fiscal space is tricky when looking at the current spending on health.�Even achieving UHC requires 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on health and reducing OOP to below 40 percent of the total health spending. Therefore, Sri Lanka has to make a significant effort to be financially secure before starting the SDG agenda. Prior to seeking funds from outside, the country can peruse opportunities through the private sector as done by other neighbouring economies (e.g., Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand). This can be done through public-private partnerships.�In addition, reorienting the existing resource allocation mechanisms to align with SDG targets would also open avenues to fill the required additional resources. Implementing the agreed SDG agenda may not be straightforward. However, the country can start the implementation of SDG 3 by making suitable amendments within the present system.�(Samanthi Bandara is a Research Officer at the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS).

As a B2B company, Expack formulated its CSR mechanism by identifying social, governance, and environmental gaps issues which require attention in the area it operates in and uplifting the community. Over the years, Expack has taken on these issues through philanthropy, education, health, ethical labour initiatives, and volunteering through its CSR programmes.A core part of strong CSR is creating shared value for the business as well as the community. Another is sustainable CSR which creates an impact instead of feel-good isolated initiatives. Expack�s philanthropic and CSR activities have strengthened its relationship with its community and stakeholders, and have been designed as long-term initiatives.Internal CSR � Long-service employee recognition and annual school books distributing ceremony among the employees� children at Expack, social responsibility begins within the organization and is reflected in its business ethos. The company endeavors to build a compassionate culture which enables its employees and facilitates inclusivity. Keeping this in mind, a Medicamp is conducted annually for all employees across the board and medical records are maintained to assess their health needs. Expack also supports the school-going children of employees by annually providing school packs with paraphernalia such as books, school bag, lunch box, stationery, and a shoe voucher. Monthly arrangements have been made to provide essential provisions and medicines for Expack employees to help with escalating living costs, while during the recent floods affected employees were given financial assistance.Having identified the need for affordable healthcare among residents in Pattiwila � where Expack is based � the company carries out a Medicare Clinic thrice a week and has treated 30,000 patients to date.

Veta Life tech start-up hopes for a dengue-free Sri Lanka,"2016-11-23 00:00:29							0						 				1517","�Veta Life, a technology start-up, is attempting to address the ever growing issue of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and Zika.To put things into perspective, the first eight months of this year alone over 38,000 cases of dengue were reported along with over 60 dengue-related deaths. Furthermore, since the identical mosquito spreads both dengue and Zika, the emerging disease Zika could pose a significant risk to Sri Lanka as well.According to health authorities, eradication of mosquito-breeding habitats is considered to be the single most important factor in limiting the spread of diseases such as dengue and Zika. The App launched by Veta, has a set of interesting features which can hopefully address the public disinterest towards the issue and negligence, together considered to be the biggest contributors to mosquito-breeding sites.Co-Founder Pradeepan Somasundaram said that the app allows individuals to set locations that are frequently used by them and their families, for instance their home, office or child�s school. Along with these frequented locations, users can also set an alert radius, across which the set locations need to be monitored for cases.��The app also allows users to report cases of dengue along with the incident location and this in-turn will serve as an alert to other users in close proximity to that location. The benefit of the app is that it will enable users to exercise greater vigilance and take extra safeguards in any location that has a relatively higher number of reported incidents. By making it personal, Veta believes that people will start taking mosquito-breeding sites more seriously, before it impacts one�s own family,� he said.�Pradeepan together with Malitta Nanayakkara and Dilshan Perera founded the Veta app with an intuitively understandable design that allows new users to easily navigate the app and instantly figure out how to use it. Veta is hopeful that even simple users of smartphones will be able to comfortably use the app.�Furthermore, given that smartphone penetration is growing exponentially in Sri Lanka, there are greater benefits in mobilizing the public and in collecting this data. For instance, analysis of user reports may reveal patterns and enable authorities, who are often faced with limited resources, to focus their efforts while dealing with epidemics.Given that one mosquito-breeding site in one household can impact an entire neighbourhood, every citizen of this country has a moral responsibility to strive towards zero mosquito-breeding sites at their homes, offices and public spaces. Only in so doing, can we protect ourselves, our families, our neighbours and most of all, our future generations from diseases such as dengue and emerging diseases such as Zika.The app (available for Android and iOS devices) is free to the Sri Lankan public and can be viewed on Veta�s website www.veta.life.�",dengue
Let�s not wallow in garbage,"2016-11-08 00:00:05							0						 				2814","Television channels showed on Saturday Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha being challenged by residents of an area in Colombo, when he went to inspect the progress of the government�s programme to collect segregated garbage in the Municipal Council areas from November 1.�A person questioned the Minister as to whether the authorities had explained to the residents on what basis the garbage should be segregated.�He said in other countries residents were provided with garbage bins in several colours to dump segregated garbage. The Minister was seen withdrawing without responding.There are two sides of the story. The Government cannot implement this kind of a programme without the support of the people on one hand and on the other hand it cannot be implemented by threatening the people by filing litigation, without a proper plan and support to the people.Needless to say that garbage is not only a simple problem in the country to be ignored, but also a life-threatening menace. For instance, the stench emanating from the much-talked- about Meethotamulla garbage dump spreads up to a radius of about a mile around it, putting hundreds of thousands of lives in danger.�Yet, thousands of tons of garbage is still being dumped there daily, while authorities are fighting each other putting forward various plans to solve the problem. With the onset the rain, another round of dengue is also just around the corner.�In the meantime, it seems to be a lucrative business for some politicians or their henchmen, as plans by one group to resolve the problem are being sabotaged by another, even at a time when President Maithripala Sirisena has willingly taken over the subject of Environment under his purviewMonths ago, Chief Minister of Western Province Isura Devapriya announced that a company from the United Kingdom had come forward to build a recycling plant for the Meethotamulla garbage dump, and the Chief Minister was seen inspecting the dump with the foreign company officials.�But now he claims that the authorities concerned were hesitant to provide a block of land for the purpose, while some other politicians are ridiculing his plan.�A move by another group of authorities to transport the Meethotamulla garbage to Ja-ela has been challenged by the people and politicians of that area.�Also there was a plan to transport Colombo garbage to Wilpattu, in order to fill the huge craters, dug by the brick producers, which has also, come a cropper.Same situation arose, when a section of the authorities of the Colombo Municipal Council was attempting to solve the problem faced by the Bloemendhal garbage mountain several years ago owing to opposition by interested parties.�We have another ever rising solid waste mountain at Madampitiya in Colombo as well, without any solution, apart from the problems faced by other local government bodies.Underhand transactions of huge amounts of money have been attributed to the impediment for the solutions of Sri Lankan garbage problem.Coming back to the segregation of garbage at household level, it is fine as a concept. But it is not clear as to whether there is a practical follow-up process. It is not clear as to what the authorities are going to do with the segregated garbage. Are they going to recycle the solid waste so collected? When? Where? By whom?�The local government bodies in the Colombo suburbs intermittently announce their plans to collect segregated solid waste. Sometimes they circulate leaflets among the respective residents informing them to segregate their garbage into two, as decaying and undecaying, according to a list they provide which does not include all items that are to be discarded.�However, with the passage of a few weeks, while people segregated their solid waste the authorities had ridiculously abandoned the programme, for want of a proper plan to dispose of the waste so collected.This issue cannot be resolved without a proper action plan and a genuine dedication on the part of the authorities as well as the citizens. ��",dengue

Zika virus: How bad can it get?,"2016-09-23 00:00:51							0						 				9069","The outbreak of the Zika virus in early 2015 in South America caught health officials off guard. The virus spread rapidly to surrounding countries and now South Asia is under threat. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has sent warnings across the globe to detect and treat the disease, and to prevent local transmissions. On Tuesday, the Philippines reported six new cases of Zika virus transmissions. Within a week, Singapore reported 258 Zika cases, including its first. There have been reports of Zika in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh and the Maldives. Taking into account the current global situation where cases have also beenreported from other countries in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Pacific, the WHO has declared Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The virus is unnoticed in 70-80% of the cases, and only 1 in every 5 cases of Zika infections result in Zika fever which is mild. The real threat has been posed on expectant women that certain countries have advised them to not travel to infected countries and women not to conceive. The mounting number of cases in areas previously unaffected and the fact that there is still so much of research needed in relation to consequences and treatment are serious concerns.�Dr. Paba Palihawadana, the Chief Epidemiologist and Director of the Epidemiological Unit, said Sri Lanka was under threat because neighbouring countries have reported cases of�Zika transmission.�At the moment, there has not been a single case of Zika reported. But that doesn�t mean that Sri Lanka could not be affected as Zika has been reported in Singapore and other neighbouring countries,� she said. ��Zika virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. There is a potential threat in Sri Lanka as the vector mosquito responsible for Zika virus transmission is the Aedes species mosquito which also transmits Dengue and Chikungunya. The vector mosquito is abundantly present in South East Asia, including Sri Lanka,� the WHO experts said. �Elaborating further, the Daily Mirror was told that if the virus was not present, the specific mosquito alone could not spread the malady. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on a person who is already infected with the virus. Epidemiology Unit sources state that since Dengue fever shows similar symptoms to the Zika virus, necessary tests have to be taken to diagnose�the disease.�When asked if State hospitals were prepared to handle Zika cases, Dr. Palihawadana replied in the affirmative. �The hospitals are ready. If someone shows symptoms, we can test them at the MRI. We will have to do mosquito control work of course just like in cases of Dengue,� she said.��You don�t have to hospitalize the patient because they can be treated at the OPD. When the first case is reported, we will have to follow it up to determine if there were any others inflicted with it. Further, we will have to get the history of the patient - whether he/she had travelled to a Zika prevalent country,� she added.��It�s better if pregnant mothers keep away from travelling to Zika-affected countries,� she said, adding that a circular had been sent by the ministry advising expectant mothers to either postpone or delay their visit to Zika-affected countries, or to consult a medical practitioner immediately after the arrival for evaluation of�the condition.��If someone travels to Zika-affected countries and on return develops fever and/or other symptoms, then he or she should inform us forthwith,� she added.�TransmissionZika is spread through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. WHO sources state that sexual transmission of the virus has also been observed in several countries, although more evidence is needed to clarify the theory. Nevertheless, the WHO recommends that the sexual partners of pregnant women, either living in or returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus occur, should practise safer sex (including using condoms) or abstain from sexual practices throughout the pregnancy. This would reduce the risk of sexual transmission and thereby moderate the possibility of pregnancy-related complications of the Zika�virus infection.�Symptoms and complicationsThe Zika virus is mainly either asymptomatic or develops mild fever known as the Zika fever or the Zika virus disease. According to WHO experts, symptoms include mild fever, skin rashes, joint pains and conjunctivitis which usually last 2-7 days. Meanwhile, Epidemiology Unit sources state that severe infections of the virus that require hospitalization are not common and deaths are rare.�The WHO notes that there are two complications that have risen due to the virus. �Microcephaly� is a rare neonatal malformation where the size of the head is much smaller compared to that of other babies of the same age and sex.�This could lead to development of convulsions and cause physical and learning disabilities as they grow older. There is no specific treatment for this condition. Some children with Microcephaly can be normal,� the WHO experts said.It should be noted that there have been cases of Zika-infected pregnant mothers who have produced normal babies without any defect. According to the WHO, there is �scientific consensus� to believe that the Zika virus causes Microcephaly and the Guillain-Barr� Syndrome (GBS). More research to confirm the theories are underway while possible links to other neurological diseases are being investigated.��Guillain-Barr� Syndrome (GBS) is a complication found in adults. Symptoms usually last a few weeks and most individuals recover without long-term, severe neurological complications. Hospitalization is required and some may need intensive care. Complete recovery can occur even from the more severe cases of GBS,� the WHO said.�Surveillance activitiesThe WHO source also said that as part of Microcephaly surveillance,Provincial and Regional Directors of Health Services, hospital directors, medical superintendents and heads of private hospitals have been instructed via a government circular to notify such neonates with Microcephaly either by post, phone, fax or email, to both the Director of Family Health Bureau (FHB) and Regional Directors of Health Services of the mothers residence area within 48 hours. This has been in practice since February 8.�On September 14 this year, the Health Ministry sent a circular with revised guidelines to all hospital directors and medical administrators of Teaching, General and Base Hospitals in the country, to all Provincial Directors of Health Services, Regional Directors of Health Services, Regional Epidemiologists and Medical Officers of Health (MOH). According to the WHO, these guidelines enable rapid diagnosis and treatment of possible infected individuals and thereby reduce potential secondary sources of infection.�The WHO said Surveillance for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) has been recommended in order to detect all possible cases with Guillain-Barr� Syndrome. AFP is the rapid onset of weakness, including weakness of the muscles of respiration and swallowing. This condition becomes severe within several days to weeks. �In Sri Lanka, surveillance of AFP has been continuing for a long time as a polio eradication strategy,� the WHO said. ��An Airport Health Post has been established to promote passive reporting of fever, joint pain, rash or conjunctivitis to the Airport Health Post by educating travellers returning to the country,� the WHO said.Addressing a recent media briefing, Dr. Palitha Mahipala said the special health unit at the BIA was equipped with the necessary drugs and health officials to examine passengers showing the slightest hint of an infection. At the moment, there are no bans on travelling to Asian countries which have reported cases of Zika, although travel restriction warnings have been issued to those travelling to countries with the Zika virus infection. �Referring to diagnostic facilities, the WHO said laboratory testing of the virus by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method was available at the Medical Research Institute.�Treatment�Thus far, there is no proven vaccine against Zika. The infection requires symptomatic treatment such as physical rest, adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration and taking paracetamol to relieve fever and pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended,� the WHO said.�Referring to measures to be taken if an infection was suspected, the WHO said, �If an infection is suspected, seek treatment promptly. Cooperate with healthcare and local governmental authorities and adhere to advice given.��When asked about how the public should react when the first case was reported, the WHO said people should not panic as mild infections develop in the majority of those infected. However, to prevent an infection, the WHO recommends people to take precautions to prevent being stung by mosquitoes.�Wear light-coloured clothes which cover the body as much as possible. Apply mosquito repellents,� the WHO said. Pregnant women should protect themselves primarily to avoid complications in the new born. Other recommended precautions include detection and destruction of mosquito breeding sites in the community to destroy mosquito larvae. The WHO points out that this precaution should not be initiated once the first case was reported, as present elimination of sites can also reduce Dengue transmission. �This can be done by emptying, cleaning, covering and destroying containers that can hold water, such as buckets, flower pots, roof gutters or tyres. This should not be carried out as a one-time-only intervention, but an on-going, daily or weekly exercise with the participation of the community (similar to prevention of Dengue as the mosquito is the same). Getting rid of mosquitoes through spraying or fogging by the local authorities is not sufficient to combat Zika,� the WHO said.",dengue

He was an intelligent student and �impressed the family with his astonishing results at the main government examinations.Harindra�s untimely death is mourned by his grieving family. ���He has always been such a good son; whenever he comes home he worships me before entering the house. When he lived with us he used to sleep beside me on a mat. I really cannot believe that he will do something like this to himself. He never showed any signs of being under stress or disturbed about anything. He loved and respected his family so much and never spoke back to us or argued with us. Before he leaves home to return to the university in Colombo, he always drinks the glass of water given by me and worships me,� Harindra�s mother J.W Nyanawathi said. �He faced several problems in life but he somehow overcame them. It breaks me to see that his life ended like this. I really don�t know what was going through his mind. From the time he was small his academic colours were vibrant and promising. He obtained extremely high marks in his grade-5 scholarship exam.���He faced his O/Ls at the �Wellassa National School� and achieved very good results which helped him gain entrance to the science stream of the Monaragala National school in Bibile. He also became the first from the Monaragala district in the Bio-science stream and was chosen to the Colombo Medical Faculty.��The mother said her son did not come home in months and that the last time he came home was in February.��He said studies were getting rather hectic and felt that coming home for the holidays would be an obstacle to his studies.

Softlogic Finance expands �Clean Zone� to public health sector,"2016-08-23 00:00:54							0						 				1580","�Driven by the overwhelming response to its innovative �Clean Zone� community initiative aimed at raising community awareness on waste management and the appropriate disposal, segregation and recycling of garbage, Softlogic Finance PLC has further extended the environmentally-friendly CSR programme to a cover host of public spaces including several state hospitals.The �Clean Zone� community initiative of Softlogic Finance expects to eventually enhance the cleanliness and facilitate effective waste management of a 100km roadside extent across the country. Initially, a 500 metre roadside extent to either side of each Softlogic Finance location which joins the programme is declared a �Clean Zone� and Softlogic Finance engages the assistance of the relevant Municipal/Urban Council for the designated area to be cleaned at shorter intervals than before, thus facilitating greater cleanliness.�The designated �Clean Zone� area will eventually be extended to cover a two kilometre extent around each location. At the launch of each �Clean Zone� programme, three separate, distinctively colour-coded bins, dedicated for the disposal of plastics, bottles and recyclable material, are placed to promote garbage segregation. Softlogic Finance staff members are also deployed to educate area residents on the vital importance of proper garbage disposal, segregation and recycling.�Following its launch in Nawala in late March 2015, in response to serious social and health problems posed by improper disposal of garbage, including increase in dengue, Softlogic Finance�s �Clean Zone� initiative has been successfully extended to its existing branches and each new branch of the company will open with �Clean Zone� facilities in place.In less than one-and-a-half years since its inception, by mid-August 2016, the programme had already been launched at 29 locations across the country, including places of worship �such as temples, churches and kovils � as well as public spaces � including town centres, places of recreation, train stations and schools � in addition to Softlogic Finance branch locations. Notably, the �Clean Zone� initiative has been launched at the Gangaramaya Temple, Ruwanweliseya Stupa and the Muthiyangana Raja Maha Vihara in Badulla. There has been an overwhelming demand from municipal councils, urban councils and schools to further extend this project, in light of the sustainable community benefits that it offers.Softlogic Finance PLC recognised that the effective waste disposal and segregation is critical in hospitals as these are public spaces frequently visited by thousands of people daily. Further, it is crucial that a sterile and clean environment is maintained in hospitals at all times. Thus, the latest phase of the �Clean Zone� programme was launched at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital in Borella, which is considered to be the country�s largest public hospital for children and the General Hospital in Matara, both of which are public spaces in which proper waste management and cleanliness are of paramount importance.�Accordingly, separate bins distinctively colour-coded as per Health Ministry approved guidelines were donated by Softlogic Finance to these two hospitals for the disposal of plastics, bottles and recyclable material. Further, at each of these �Clean Zone� locations, instructions detailing proper waste segregation and disposal have been provided in all three languages for the ease of the thousands of people who frequently visit them. This is expected to assist in further improving the cleanliness of these hospitals and accordingly benefit hospital staff and the large number of members of the public who visit these hospitals daily. ��We take great pleasure in the success of the �Clean Zone� community initiative in making a meaningful and sustainable contribution to solve a very serious social issue,� Softlogic Finance PLC CEO, Nalin Wijekoon said. �Softlogic Finance is most encouraged by the highly positive responses and support that it has received from Municipal and Urban Councils across the country. With their assistance, we are committed to further expanding this programme.�Softlogic Finance PLC is part of the Softlogic Group that has interests in healthcare, retail, financial services, ICT, leisure, automobiles and restaurants.��",dengue

The health sector is sick,"2016-07-23 00:00:33							0						 				2529","Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, proudly boasting that he believes Sri Lanka has one of the best health services in the region, on Thursday received a World Health Organisation (WHO) certificate declaring Sri Lanka as a filaria-free country. He says Sri Lanka will also soon receive a WHO certificate declaring that we are a malaria free country. ��While these certificates are healthy signs, the dengue epidemic continues to rage though even the Armed Services have been deployed for the war against the mosquito and dengue breeding sites. Worse still is the unseen door malignant cancer growing in vital areas of the health sector with widespread corruption or frauds while private hospitals and some millionaire medical consultants among others are turning a once sacred vocation of medicine or healing into one of the biggest profit making businesses. ��Last week the Health Minister said he would introduce regulations to control the huge amounts charged at private hospitals for surgical operations, scans and more than 40 medical laboratory tests. He said consultancy fees would also be fixed at a maximum of Rs. 2000. Well and good. But it is not only the cynics who ask valid questions as to how effectively the regulations will be implemented and what some spin doctors will do to continue the plunder of innocent and unsuspecting patients. ��For almost a decade, a law is supposed to have been in force to monitor and regulate the work, charges and other aspects of private hospitals. A Deputy Director of Health Services headed this division but what it has done or failed to do is seen in what is happening in the private health sector.�Meanwhile the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) -- set up last year after a 10-year battle by health action groups to re-implement Prof. Senaka Bibile�s essential medicines concept -- appears to be stuck in controversies and conflicts. The NMRA effectively started work in November last year under the chairmanship of the eminent Prof. Laal Jayakody, head of the department of Pharmacology of the Colombo Medical Faculty. Next in command as the Chief Executive Officer, was the equally eminent Prof. Krishantha Weerasuriya, the WHO�s former drug policy advisor for South Asia. The NMRA did good work for about seven months preventing sections of the big pharma Mafia from importing non-essential or possibly harmful drugs valued at millions of dollars. But Prof.Jayakody and Prof. Weerasuriya resigned last month saying they were not able to work independently and intense pressure was being put on them not only by big pharma agents but also by top officials of the Health Ministry. ��It appeared the minister was not too sad to accept their resignations and just like Sri Lanka lost the services of Prof. Bibile it has now lost the services of two eminent pharmacology professors while the medicinal drug business is more sickening than curative. The minister later appointed Prof. Asitha de Silva head of the Department of Pharmacology of the North Colombo Medical College as the NMRA�s new chairman while Dr. Kamal Jayasinghe, a ministry official, was appointed as the CEO. The People�s Movement for the Rights of Patients (PMRP) has filed action in the Court of Appeal challenging the appointment of Prof. Asita de Silva on the basis that he has been a director of a drug research company and therefore there was a conflict of interest. The PMRP petition also claims that under the law the minister cannot appoint the CEO who has to be named by members of the NMRA. ��In the pharmacy sector another plague continues. Like private hospitals pharmacies have also become a big business and thousands have been set up. Investigations have shown that hundreds if not thousands of pharmacies are functioning without a qualified pharmacist with businessmen buying the licence for a big amount and hanging it as a show-piece. Qualified pharmacists say another racket involves the so-called food and drug inspectors. In many instances when they find that drugs are not being properly stored or some other malpractice is taking place, the owners are told they would have to pay up to Rs. 50,000 if they are taken to courts. So it would be better to give Rs. 10,000 to the inspector. This is done often, the owners make more profits, the inspectors get richer -- again at the expense of millions of unsuspecting patients who buy low quality or counterfeit drug. � ��",dengue
"Citizens awake, join the war on Dengue","2016-07-07 00:12:09							0						 				1678","Since the detection of the first dengue case in 1962, this deadly mosquito-borne disease has spread rapidly in Sri Lanka and is reaching epidemic proportions this year with 27,731 cases reported up to the end of June 30. ��The number of cases last year was 21,500. In 2014 it was 46,584, the highest annual figure so far, but public health experts say this year is likely to be the worst unless effective counteraction is taken immediately. �The dengue crisis became worse after the major floods from May 15 this year and the Health Ministry has called in even the security forces to check whether there are mosquito breeding sites in schools, other institutions and home gardens. Red letters have been issued to several while others have been hauled to courts and fined. Local Councils which fail to clean drains effectively and regularly also need to be punished in some way or named and shamed. But the dengue mosquito keeps on breeding faster, therefore it appears there is a need to reconsider the thrust of the preventive measures. ��One of the countries, which successfully overcame the dengue crisis is Cuba and we need to take the right lessons from it. Even more effective than the Bacillus Thuringiensis Serotype Israelensis (BTI) process -- which succeeded in Cuba but for some reason failed in Sri Lanka -- are social awareness, community responsibility and effective action by civic conscious citizens who need to be brought together for the battle against dengue. The crisis is so grave that the government needs to utilize the mass media to create and spread awareness of the need for the people to get proactively involved in this battle. ��Most TV networks give about two hours of their prime time for teledramas which are largely in the entertainment sphere though critical social analysts have raised serious questions about the themes of most of these teledramas and ask whether they promote or degrade Sri Lanka�s hallowed culture and tradition.�Whatever it is, in this emergency situation entertainment needs to be sacrificed and millions of people could be made aware at prime time as to what they should do or should not do to win this dengue war. ��For instance the people need to be made aware�with facts and figures�that mosquito coils are not the best or safest way to keep the mosquito away. Millions of coils are sold daily with effective promotion by what social analysts described as the mosquito coil business mafia. Instead of keeping the mosquito away in most cases the regular or excessive use of coils is known to cause or aggravate breathing or lung problems. It seems that this so-called prevention process is often worse than the disease.World health experts believe the safest, the best and least costly way is to use mosquito nets. Good quality medicated nets could be used for several years and in the long-run the cost will be less than buying coils for more than five years. At present the good market and other places sell mosquito coils made from leaves but this is done in a limited way. ��The government needs to consider the possibility of making a valuable and productive investment of providing medicated mosquito nets at subsidised rates as an effective part of fighting the battle against dengue. ��The once-powerful Lanka Samasamaja Party and other socialist movements headed by leaders such as Dr. N. M. Perera, Dr. Colvin R. de Silva, Dr. S. A. Wickremasinghe and even one of modern medicine prophets, Prof. Senaka Bibile rose beyond party politics and played a major role in battling and overcoming the malaria epidemic, with Sri Lanka this year asking the World Health Organisation to declare it a malaria-free country. We need to see an active role played by such socio-political activists in the battle against dengue. We hope Yahapalanaya government leaders and even the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, which seems to be giving the leadership to the socialist movement, will rise beyond party politics would come forward to play a more stinging role to defeat the little killer. ��",dengue
Defying Dengue Hospital sees steady rise in dengue patients this June,"2016-07-06 00:00:29							0						 				1987","Dengue and viral fever have been taking its toll on the country this season while Dengue is said to be at its peak during the month of June. The Lady Ridgeway Hospital which is deemed to be the prime children�s hospital in the country, witness almost 70 dengue cases daily. In a press release issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) about the outcome of the Global Health Security (GHS) meeting in Bali, Indonesia in June, stated that a significant threat to GHS is due to the number of national health systems that are weak, fragmented and under-funded.�The statement notes that only about one thirds of the countries in the world have the ability to assess, detect and respond to public health emergencies. It further remarks that the true power of health systems is their ability to deliver timely and quality health services to those in need in a comprehensive way and on an adequate scale. These systems are especially important during emergencies and outbreaks when access to quality essential health services can be severely compromised. Is Sri Lanka prepared to face this outbreak of dengue and viral flu, especially as the figures have doubled compared to previous years? ��Dengue cases doubledAccording to the Lady Ridgeway hospital records, there has been an increase in dengue patients. �As of May 31, 2016 there have been 1340 dengue cases, out of which 211 were dengue haemorrhagic cases. There have been 2 deaths that were caused because the patients were transferred late. In 2015, there were 2561 dengue patients admitted to the hospital. So there�s a definite rise� Lady Ridgeway Hospital Director Dr. W. K. Wickramasinghe said. �Speaking to the Daily Mirror he added that there was an outbreak of dengue usually in June. �This is seasonal, but there was no such peak outbreak in the corresponding month last year.� ���After the floods the affected areas weren�t cleaned on time. The garbage was left unattended while tins and cans were strewn everywhere. These are breeding hubs. Mosquitoes can breed within a week. This has had an impact on this year�s outbreak,� he added. ���We have around 70 cases of dengue everyday and have six special wards where dengue patients are treated. All these wards have special units called �Dengue High Dependency Units� where children found to be in critical stages receive treatment.�So the management has improved drastically,� he remarked. He added that children were often transferred to the LRH as it is the best place for dengue treatment in comparison to the private sector.��Preliminary Care Unit (PCU) for Dengue ManagementWhen asked how the Preliminary Care Unit (PCU) established in 2015 contributed in managing dengue, he said �The Out Patient Department (OPD) is crowded these days due to large influx of patients.�Around 3000 children come to the OPD. Children in a critical stages are sent to the emergency unit (PCU) while the others are treated at the OPD by nurses who examine and prioritize the child patients.� ���Children sent to the PCU are examined, screened and monitored up to 4 hours after which the decision is made as to whether they should be admitted to the hospital or could be sent home.�A consultant�s view is needed to arrive at this decision. This is advantageous both to the patient and the hospital. If there was no PCU, the patients admitted at night would have to stay for at least 12 hours before they could go home. ����There are 20 doctors working in the preliminary care unit and 3 specialist residential paediatricians who look into dengue related cases. Even at the OPD, we have adequate number of doctors. Though the figures have doubled we are able to manage the situation.� ��Dr. Nalika de Silva, Consultant Paedeatrician said, �The PCU is a 10-bedded unit with modern monitoring equipment where 20 Medical Officers (MO) and 3 consultants work around the clock. The objective of the PCU is to handle emergencies. We generally keep the child patient for a maximum of 4 hours in the PCU. In some cases a bit longer if he/she could be sent home. We act upon the child�s life-threatening complications as soon as possible and direct them to either the ICU or to the wards depending on the condition.� ��Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Paediatrician elaborated on the management of dengue in the PCU, �When a child comes in shock, the emergency management is carried out at the PCU. When a febrile child with low platelets come to our unit, we may get them down, sometimes several times a day to check if their platelet counts are constantly dropping. If the child enters the critical phase, then we admit him/her to the wards. However, most of the children with Dengue may not enter the critical phase.� �Dr. Neetha Pieris, Consultant Paediatrician spoke further on the management of a critically ill dengue child, �At the initial stage, dengue will have similar features to a viral flu. But, when a child is in the critical stage, he/she should be treated with careful fluid management. Children in the critical phase (leaking phase) can go into shock if not treated. Therefore it is important to recognize the children entering the critical phase.� ��The Triage system�Dr. Karunaratne also spoke on the triage system, �Triaging means sorting out ill patients from relatively well patients. When a patient comes to Lady Ridgeway Hospital they are triaged by triage nurses stationed at the entrance. The Triage nurse would decide if the patient should either go to the PCU or the OPD. We want to go further and develop a scoring system, where the nurses score the children based on their vital signs. In other words, it is similar to a �traffic light� system where the red and the yellow patients come to the PCU while the green patients go to the OPD. From the OPD the child would be able to go home after consultation. In the present situation where the number of Dengue cases are on the rise the triage system would benefit us immensely in giving immediate care for shocked children and clearing children with no signs of leaking.� ��Viral Flu on the rise�The number of patients with Viral Flu has also increased. As dengue is around, people are extremely concerned and they seek treatment immediately,� said the Director. ��There is a viral flu going around which is dominated by vomiting and diarrhoea. In some cases patients would not have diarrhoea but only vomiting.�This may be referred to as stomach flu (viral gastritis). In order to control these types of viral flu, it would be helpful to isolate the virus if possible where preventive actions could be taken,� said Dr. Karunaratne. �Emergency situations: Children with fever should come to hospital��If a child has high fever for more than two days, he/she should consult the doctor and obtain a full blood count report as a precaution due to the increase in Dengue cases.�If this blood count reveals a �low platelet count� and the child has persistent vomiting, abdominal pain, cold sweaty skin and is dehydrated, he/she should be brought to the hospital immediately.�However, if your child is 3 months old with a temperature running at 380 C or between 3-6 months with a temperature of 390 C or a child of any age who looks pale, sleepy, breathing fast or showing signs of dehydration should also be brought to the hospital as these groups of children are suspected to be at risk of serious illness,� said Dr. Kosala Karunaratne. ���We only ask parents to bring their children as quickly as they can. Delaying would have detrimental effects,� said Dr. Wickramasinghe, Director - LRH.�Pics by Nisal Baduge",dengue
DENGUE MOSQUITO WREAKING HAVOC AGAIN,"2016-06-29 00:10:51							0						 				2469","The Health Ministry on Sunday said in a statement that the number of dengue cases reported for the past six months of this year had exceeded 20,000 while claiming 31 lives. If we are to put the numbers exactly the cases reported had been 20,731 of which 4,761 cases had been reported from the densely populated Western Province. Also the Health Entomology Science Officers Association had said that the density of mosquito larvae had increased drastically and Sri Lanka marked the highest density of mosquitoes in the world according to the Britto Index which measures the density of mosquitoes.A week ago the Director General of Health Services, Dr. Palitha Mahipala had stated that dengue had reached an epidemic level in the Western Province and Kandy and the Health authorities had advised the people on regular garbage disposal.Although the recent floods that swept the areas abutting the Kelani River from Awissawella to Modara in Colombo had been blamed as one major reason for the increase of mosquito breeding, the Health Ministry statement cites other reasons such as the bad procedures followed in construction sites as well. For instance, the Colombo Municipal Council had recently issued red notices to more than 70 construction sites for mosquito breeding. According to the Health Ministry,the workplace related mosquito-breeding had increased from 38 per cent in 2015 to 40 per cent this year while the breeding in school premises had gone up to 38 per cent this year from 32 per cent reported last year. More than 160 dengue patients including 12 students had been admitted by Sunday to the IDH Hospital alone which deals mainly with infectious diseases and is situated close to the flood-affected areas. The situation cannot be a surprise considering the deterioration of cleanliness in major towns in the recent past for which even President Maithripala Sirisena had reprimanded the relevant minister last year.However, the situation still remains the same. The health authorities who always rightly advice the general public to remove their garbage in a regular manner do not seem to have taken note of the lethargic attitude of the local authorities who are mainly responsible for garbage disposal. It goes without saying that people in premises of five to ten perches in the urban areas find it difficult to dispose of their garbage without the help of the local authorities as they do not have enough land to bury the garbage, as advised by the health authorities. The garbage problem soon after the recent floods in the Kelani Valley was unprecedented in that area,as there was a mountain of garbage outside each flood-affected house affected. It took weeks for the local authorities of the affected areas to get the help of the other local authorities to remove flood garbage after so many discussions, in spite of the fact that this was not the first flood experience in Sri Lanka. Though the authorities had announced that they had completed the disposal of flood garbage by June 9, the Health Ministry�s statement on Sunday blamed that the mosquito breeding has increased in flood-affected areas due to the inability of the local authorities to remove garbage that is still piled up in various places in the area.An international conference on Dengue and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever organized by the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry was held between February 24 and 26 this year at the BMICH with President Maithripala Sirisena participating as the chief guest to �discuss dengue and its management, prevention and control strategies,� among others. It is not clear as to what the relevant Sri Lankan authorities had learnt from that conference and what their follow-up measures were. Needless to say that people have to be advised, but the lead role must be played by the relevant authorities, especially the health authorities and the local government bodies in the eradication of dengue or any other epidemic for that matter. They must admit their failure with the announcement of dengue reaching an epidemic level.",dengue

Therefore the implementation of a dengue vaccine can be seen as an efficacious and infallible measure to completely eradicate the disease from Sri Lanka.�The First Licensed�Dengue VaccineAccording to the WHO, CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia�) by Sanofi Pasteur is the first dengue vaccine to be licensed.It was first licensed in Mexico in December 2015 for use in individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic areas.This vaccine has been evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials, which included more than 35,000 participants.CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia�) has now been licensed by several dengue-endemic countries in Asia and Latin America for use in 9 - 45 or 9 - 60 year-olds, and is under regulatory review in several others.The WHO stated that approximately five additional dengue vaccine candidates were in clinical development, with two candidates (developed by Butantan and Takeda) began Phase III trials in early 2016.Ten countries have been selected as trial sites for the phase III trials of the Takeda vaccines and Sri Lanka is the only Asian country to�be selected.�Clinical Trials in�Sri LankaAs part of the clinical procedures in developing and licensing their vaccine, Takeda, a research organisation based in the United States and Japan signed an MOU with the Director General of Health Services Dr. Palitha Mahipala.Accordingly as part of the Phase III trials, the vaccine will be tested on 4,000 schoolchildren in Colombo, where Dengue is predominant.An Epidemiology Unit Spokesman stated that this was a scientific study before a decision to introduce a vaccine was made.�If the vaccine is proven to be highly efficacious and safe, then we could make a decision to introduce it in Sri Lanka. There will be a recruiting criteria and one of the criteria is to recruit from schoolchildren as well.�A substantial number of clinical trials should take place in endemic countries prior to the introduction of a vaccine. Sri Lanka is one of the trial sites and there are other countries involved. This is a global study both in the American and Asian region where Dengue is endemic,� the spokesman said.�Is the vaccine safe?A spokesman for the Epidemiology Unit said that the Takeda vaccine has already been tested globally on 1500-2000 children as part of Phase II trials. As the vaccine has been proven to be efficacious �and safe, the scope of testing has been expanded and 20,000 children globally will be tested.The spokesman stated that when a vaccine reached Phase III trials, safety had already been established. The ages of the sample size was similar to the group of children that the vaccine will be used on in the future.According to the Epidemiology Unit the vaccine developed incorporated all four serotypes (A serologically distinguishable strain of a microorganism) into it.One particular serotype has been purified and the other three serotypes have been incorporated. Therefore, the recipient is expected to develop immunity against all four dengue viruses.�Phase III trialThe spokesman stated that the Phase III trial was the last hurdle before registration.�It is a large scale trial and this is where the efficacy of the vaccine is truly tested. A control experiment is carried out at the same time to discern the efficiency of the disease. Since there is a vaccine that is already registered, the control sample will be given a placebo. But none of the volunteers will know, who was given the placebo or who was given the registered vaccine. This is called a double blind test and it will ensure the validity of the trial.�He added that blood samples of those in trial would be examined to check the level of immunity given by the vaccine.�Ideally if the vaccine is 100 percent effective, no one should get dengue in that group. However, since there are four serotypes, dengue is an extremely�complex disease.�No vaccine can give 100 percent immunity from the disease. But once infected, natural immunity lasts lifelong. If you are infected with one of the serotypes, you are immune to that serotype in the future, but you will be not immune to the three other three serotypes.�It should also be noted that usually when you are infected the second time with another serotype, it is much worse than the first time.��Challenges��Phase I and Phase II are pre-clinical trials and are often tested on animals. Usually in other diseases animals contract the disease once the virus is injected in to them. But when it comes to dengue there�s no animal model as dengue is a human disease that doesn�t affect any other mammal or animal. This was why it took so long for a vaccine to be produced,� said the Spokesman.�Natural immunity gave rise to the thought of a vaccine. Yet, unlike measles or chickenpox, dengue virus is complex as it has four serotypes. So, we need to have a vaccine against all these four serotypes. This is an arduous task and after 75 years of research, we see only one vaccine registered,� he added.�Introducing a vaccine in Sri Lanka�There is a three tier decision making process in Sri Lanka before a vaccine is finally introduced. Firstly, the vaccine has to be registered by the NMRA (The National Medicines Regulatory Authority) in�the country.�Here vaccinologists, pharmacologists and epidemiologists will be asked to review the vaccine profile.�Secondly, the national programme has to make a decision as to whether this vaccine could be incorporated into our�immunization programme.�The third tier includes an operational research, where a relatively small group of people would be given the vaccine to see if the vaccine is immunogenic and safe,� said the Spokesman.He added that the operational research would examine whether children developed any side effects and whether the vaccine could beat strains unique to Sri Lanka.�Subsequently the research results will be examined by a panel of experts and a decision will be made. Even the Takeda vaccine will have to go through this three tier process after the phase III trials,� he noted.He stated that there were three main mechanisms to eradicate dengue- vaccination, clinical management and prevention of�dengue transmission.��Vaccine is a preventive mechanism. But there are other strategies that we need to work on. When young children and adults fall sick with fever, we need to immediately check the cause of fever. One cause of fever could be dengue.People should not go for self-medication, such as pain killers and unconventional means of medication, because such methods have not been tested in the same magnitude as the standardized method of treatment,� he said.He elaborated on how the vaccine would �be administered.�In Sri Lanka both children and adults are affected by dengue. The present vaccine that is registered is recommended for children above 9 years. Children below 9 years have to seek treatment. Therefore their medical care has to be of good quality. �",dengue
Mapping public health with GIS,"2016-06-13 00:00:51							0						 				1039","By Ashani Jayasinghe-DabarePublic health efforts have been based on analysis and use of location-related data (spatial data) for many years. The first of such cases would be in the 1800s, by Dr. John Snow (physician - not the character from the much-talked about TV series �Game of Thrones� these days) � who is often credited as the father of epidemiology and is arguably the most famous of those examples.�A hand-drawn paper map was used by Dr. Snow to mark the locations of the reported victims and analyse the geographic locations of deaths related to cholera in London in the mid-1850s. He superimposed his maps showing death locations with maps of public water supplies and was able to find an area where the deaths clustered near a water pump on the city�s Broad Street. This pinpointed the Broad Street pump as the most likely source of the cholera outbreak. The removal of the pump�s handle led to a rapid decline in the incidence of cholera, helping the medical community to eventually conclude that cholera was a water-borne disease.Dr. Snow�s research eventually became part of a field known as disease diffusion mapping (Wikipedia.org). This is an area of study that claims that a disease started from a central source and spread according to patterns and conditions of the environment.Even today, Dr. Snow�s work provides an indication of how a geographic information systems (GIS) could benefit the public health investigations and other research in this area.�Dr. Snow continued to analyse his data, eventually showing that the incidence rate of cholera was also related to local elevation as well as soil type and alkalinity. Low-lying areas, predominantly those with poorly draining soil, were found to have higher incidence rates for cholera - which Dr. Snow attributed to the pools of water that tended to collect there, again showing evidence that cholera was in fact a water-borne disease (rather than one borne by �miasma� or bad air, as it was commonly believed at the time.)This is an early example of what has come to be known as disease diffusion mapping, an area of study based on the idea that a disease starts from some source or central point and then spreads throughout the local area according to patterns and conditions there. This is yet another area of research where the capabilities of a GIS have been shown to be of help�to practitioners.�GIS for public healthToday�s public health problems are much larger in scope than those Dr. Snow faced in the mid-1850s and researchers today depend on modern GIS or GIS data (that is geographically referenced) and other computer mapping applications to assist in their analyses.�Public health informatics (PHI) is an emerging specialty which focuses on the application of information science and technology to public health practice and research. As part of that work, GIS� or more commonly a spatial decision support system (SDSS), offers improved data and geographic visualization techniques, leading to faster, better and more robust understanding and decision-making capabilities in the public health arena.For example, GIS displays have been used to show a clear relationship between clusters of emergent chronic kidney disease patients in Sri Lanka in one case the correlation between the fluoride content ground water and dental health issues in certain parts of the country or how concentration of Thalassemia patients is high in the Kurunegala District versus the rest of the country.Dengue was another disease that was mapped for decision support heavily in Sri Lanka.In more developed countries like Singapore, they use these health GIS maps for control of diseases like diabetics and infant healthcare. Real-time GIS technology is used to update regional and national health department cases reported at regional clinics, then the data is automatically mapped into the country map and used as a decision support tool. Map and location-based information from other sources are also overlapped on top of this existing data to analyse trends, time-related patterns, etc., and take decisions that improve the population health.A few more international examples that can be cited include from the US, the recording of Hepatitis C cases and those of known intravenous drug users in Connecticut. Causality is difficult to prove conclusively � collocation does not establish causation � but confirmation of previously established causal relationships (like intravenous drug use and Hepatitis C) can strengthen acceptance of those relationships, as well as help to demonstrate the utility and reliability of GIS-related solution techniques. Conversely, showing the coincidence of potential causal factors with the ultimate effect can help suggest a potential causal relationship, thereby driving further investigation and analysis.Alternately, GIS techniques have been used to show a lack of correlation between causes and effects or between different effects. For example, the distribution of both birth defects and infant mortality in Iowa was studied and the researchers found no relationship in those data. This led to the conclusion that birth defects and infant mortality are likely unrelated but likely due to different causes and risk factors.GIS can support public health in different ways as well. First and foremost, GIS displays can help inform proper understanding and drive better decisions. GIS can play a significant role in the effort to improve and sustain the health of the citizens, that effort, helping public health practitioners identify areas of disparities or inequities and ideally helping them identify and develop solutions to address those shortcomings. GIS can also help researchers integrate disparate data from a wide variety of sources (e.g. Map data on demographics by the Census and Statistics Department, disaster prone area maps from the Disaster Management Centre, etc.,) and discover trends and correlational factors that affect a population.Issues with GIS for public health�Unfortunately, much public health data is still manually generated and is therefore subject to human-generated mistakes and miscoding and misinterpretation.�There are also concerns or issues with the use of GIS tools for public health efforts. Chief among those is a concern for privacy and confidentiality of individuals.Public health is concerned about the health of the population as a whole but must use data on the health of individuals to make many of those assessments and protecting the privacy and confidentiality of those individuals is of paramount importance. Use of GIS displays and related databases raises the potential of compromising those privacy standards, so some precautions are necessary to avoid pinpointing individuals based on spatial data.�It is well established in the literature that statistical inference based on aggregated data can lead researchers to erroneous conclusions, suggesting relationships that in fact do not exist or obscuring relationships that do in fact exist. This issue is known as the modifiable areal unit problem. For example, in New York public health officials worried that cancer clusters and causes would be misidentified after they were forced to post maps showing cancer cases by ZIP code on the Internet. Their assertion was that ZIP codes were designed for a purpose unrelated to public health issues and so use of these arbitrary boundaries might lead to inappropriate groupings and then to incorrect conclusions.�ConclusionThe field of medical geographic information systems (medical GIS) has become extremely useful in understanding the bigger picture of public health. The discipline holds a substantial capacity to understand not only differences but also similarities in population health all over the world. The main goal of marrying the disciplines of medical geography, public health and informatics is to understand how countless health issues impact populations and the trends by which these populations are affected.�From the 1990s to today, this practical approach has become a valued and progressive system in analysing medical and epidemiological phenomena ranging from cholera to cancer. The instruments supporting this field include geographic information systems (GIS), disease surveillance, big data and analytical approaches like the Geographical Analysis Machine (GAM), Dynamic Continuous Area Space Time Analysis (DYCAST), cellular automata, agent-based modelling, spatial-statistics and self-organising maps.�The positive effects on disease mapping have proven to be tremendous as these instruments continue to have a great impact on the mission to improve worldwide healthcare. While traditional uses of GIS in public health are static and lacking real-time components, implementing a space-time animation in these instruments will be monumental as technology and data continue to grow.�The use of GIS in public health is still in its infancy stage of application and like most new applications - there is a lot of potential to be harnessed and drawbacks to be evaded on this path. Many researchers and practitioners are concentrating on this effort, hoping that the benefits will outweigh, the risks and the costs linked with this evolving application area for furthering the modern�GIS techniques.(Ashani Jayasinghe-Dabare is CEO of GIS Solutions and subsidiary of Just In Time Group)",dengue
Are we addicted to allopathy -  EDITORIAL,"2016-05-04 00:00:08							0						 				1430","The national or consensus Government has pledged that after May Day and its roaring rallies, priority would be given to the implementation of promises or policies relating to vital areas. On Monday the Daily Mirror in its Editorial spotlighted the Government�s plan to make it compulsory for children between the ages of 5 and 16 to go to school and receive a life-building education. Parents who fail to ensure this will be guilty of an offence.Today we wish to spotlight another vital area-health care for all and measures to bring about an awareness that healing is not a business but a vocation and the patient is sacred. An important paradigm shift needs to come through a national health policy where all forms of healing - allopathy, various forms of �ayurveda, homoeopathy, acupuncture and other forms of healing - are given an equal place.At present far too much emphasis is given, especially in city and sub-urban areas, to allopathy �or western medicine. That may be one of the reasons why the private health sector has become one of the biggest profitable businesses with a growing number of private hospitals, medical specialists, trans-national pharmaceutical companies and others making millions of rupees at the expense of the unsuspecting and helpless patients.Last year, after a decade of delays and allegedly corrupt practices mainly by drug companies, Parliament unanimously approved legislation for the implementation of Prof. Senaka Bibile�s national medicinal drugs policy. In terms of this, a high-powered National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) was appointed mainly to ensure that the people have access to quality drugs at affordable prices. Financial resources for the high-powered NMRA were approved only in November last year. Its Chairman Prof. Laal Jayakody, Chief �Executive Officer Prof. Krishantha Weerasuriya and others are working in a spirit of sincerity and sacrifice to restore a health service where the well-being of patients is given top priority. Health Ministry officials have still not gazetted regulations to monitor and control the prices of drugs. We hope this would be done soon so that the complex process of testing the quality, efficacy and the safety of drugs could be streamlined with full use being made of the latest methods of medical technology - a facility that Prof. Bibile did not have in the 1970s.�While the NMRA is given facilities and encouragement to achieve its objectives, the Government needs to take practical steps to revive other forms of healing and give the people an awareness of the options and health benefits available to them.�For thousands of years Sri Lanka has experienced the great healing power of ayurveda. The Lord Buddha himself has referred to the healing power in thousands of varieties of herbs and plants. For instance the good old Kothamalli is still widely used by millions of people for relief from fever, colds and other ailments.�If the marvels of modern technology are used for research on the healing value of � plants and fruits, we could make great discoveries and strides. Many herbal medicine analysts believe there could be healing power for instance in the mangosteen or rambutan skins which we now just throw away. The setting up of an ayurveda �medical research institute with digital technology facilities could be one step to make creative and innovative medicinal items from the resources we have.Homoeopathy also has much potential with homoeopaths sharing information online and making new discoveries. For years homoeopathy experts have said they have an effective cure for dengue, but the Government health authorities have not shown even a small dose of the interest they have in the preventive vaccine manufactured by a foreign company. Acupuncture, with a history of thousands of years, also could be upgraded through modern medical technology and used for the benefit of millions of people.With most Sri Lankans having access �to the internet and search engines, even lay people could do research studies on the latest trends and new discoveries just as a Sri Lankan ENT specialist did some research online and found a manioc cure for cancer. � � � � � � �",dengue
Gammanpila is a parasite: Mervyn,"2016-05-03 16:33:50							17						 				13390","Former minister Mervyn Silva today lashed out at MP Udaya Gammanpila over his remarks that Mr. Silva was responsible for the downfall of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and called Mr. Gammanpila a parasite.Mr. Gammanpila is reported to have told a news conference that the behaviour of the twosome Mr. Silva and former MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena had led to Mr. Rajapaksa's defeat at last year's presidential election.�It�s not me who collected money from people and I don�t have corruption charges against me.

Papaya leaves can beat dengue,"2016-04-26 00:42:49							3						 				11743","Dr. Sanath Hettige won the Presidential Award for the best medical invention for 2013 at the presidential awards ceremony held on the Feb 5, 2016 for his invention of papaya leaf syrup, tablets and capsules for the treatment of dengue fever and other medical conditions. This is the highest award for practitioners in the field of medicine. The award is generally given to inventors and rarely to doctors. Dr Hettige is a certified specialist in the field of Family Medicine and is the chairman for the Board of Study in Family Medicine of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine in the University of Colombo. He is also the editor of the Independent Medical Association and a council member of the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka. �In an engaging interview with the Daily Mirror Dr.Hettige shared his experience, research results and myths associated with the positive effects of papaya leaf syrup.Q �Please tell us about your research.Research and invention are my keen interests. I have invented ointments such as �Oil of Dermae� which is a remedy for the cracking of feet, soles and hands, dry skin, and effective for a rare �medical condition known as plantar keratosis and a hair cream for the stimulation of hair growth. They are my own preparations and are not copied formulae. Indian doctors have experienced the efficacy of this preparation and are now in the process of importing them . In 2008, the knowledge about dengue management was poor. As a result complications arose and the death rate was high. At that time I thought of a herbal medicine. I have established a medical centre, a research laboratory and a factory in Maharagama where my products are manufactured. I used to observe monkeys eating papaya leaves. I conducted research on papaya leaves and found that papaya leaves had been used by aborigines to treat malaria. At the time there were no suggestions that papaya leaves were a remedy for dengue, but as monkeys consumed it, we knew it wasn�t toxic. Four of my employees and myself consumed papaya leaves and another five did not. Then we took blood tests and found that the platelet count, white blood cells count (WBC) and the red blood cell count (RBC) of even healthy individuals had increased. Meanwhile, my clerk contracted dengue when his platelet count dropped to 70 000. As one who had participated in papaya leaves trial before insisted in taking papaya leaf syrup. Within 2 days his platelet count increased dramatically and the fever receded. He recovered without been admission to a hospitalSome three wheel drivers of the Watthegedara area close to my clinic my clerk was friendly with also took papaya leaf syrup when they contracted dengue and were cured proving the efficacy papaya leaves in treating dengue. It was then that I decided to conduct scientific research on the papaya leaf treatment. 12 patients who came to my clinic voluntarily agreed to take papaya leaves and then take blood tests when it was found that their platelet count and WBC counts had increased with improvement of their overall medical condition. So, papaya leaves not only increase the platelet count but helps to increase WBC counts and reduce fever and the duration of the illness simultaneously. This is where a lot of people misunderstood my first article. There is no isolated increase of the platelet count; we monitor the improvement through the platelet count alone.Q �And then?When you conduct research, there are 3 stages: First you conduct experiments using rats, then the experiment is done on human beings followed by a control experiment where we give the syrup to some and not give it to others in the experiment. The rat experiment was done in other countries after my human experiment. In late 2009 I wanted to conduct a randomised control clinical experiment. I needed approval from ethical clearance committees such as the unit at the Sri Lanka Medical Association to conduct the control trial. If they approve it, they have to take the responsibility in case something happens to the patient. In 2009 the ethical clearance unit at the Sri Lanka Medical Association did not permit me to conduct the experiment because they were not convinced [of its safety and efficacy]. They wanted me to bring evidence from Ayurveda literature and show that papaya leaves has been prescribed as a remedy.A control experiment was conducted in Malaysia before I got the opportunity. In 2013 I applied again highlighting that Malaysia had conducted the experiment. Thereafter, the ethical clearance committee of the Sri Jayawardene University approved my application.�If the platelet count increases despite the fact that the patient�s condition(fever etc) was not improving, it becomes a complication to the physician. This is where my control experiment played a major role as it was able to clear the previous misconception that papaya leaves only increases the platelet count. As part of the experiment we reached patients who had not yet reached the critical stage warded at the Kalubowila Hospital. We divided them into two groups and checked them to ascertain how many had reached the critical phase and how many had not in the two groups. We examined the thorax of all the patients daily and found that only two patients from the treated group had fluid in their lungs compared to ten in the untreated group. We also saw that the duration of fever was reduced by 50% and the hospital stay reduced by one day. It was not only the platelet count increase we observed but also in a reduction in the conversion of dengue patients to the dengue hemorrhagic stage. The results of this study will be published soon.�Q Are there any side effects in this treatment?The syrup (papaya leaf extract) can also be taken in the form of a capsule which contains only pure papaya leaf extract. There are no side effects. The only problem is the bitter taste in the syrup. However, patients must take the medicine in the first spike of fever, and they must take it regularly to obtain optimum results.�Q Is the papaya syrup more of an Ayurveda product?A Herbal medicine is generally categorised as Ayurvedic but most western medicines are derived from plant material or originally identified in plant extracts. Quinine, for instance, was discovered from the cinchona tree. Ayurvedic preparations are not proven by clinical research. However, before western medicine enters a market extensive research is done to prove its efficacy and safety. But, when considering the papaya leaf juice, substantial research has been done locally and internationally proving its safety and efficacy.��Q �Why are doctors reluctant to use the papaya leaf medicine on dengue patients?The papaya leaf syrup is a herbal medicine and therefore not categorized as an allopathic drug (as in western/modern medicine) and doctors usually refrain from using herbal medicine on patients. However, this is the first time in Sri Lanka a herbal medicine which is not allopathic was used in a clinical trial in a tertiary care hospital for a potentially serious illness. Clinical trials are rarely conducted in herbal medicine.�Q �Can papaya leaf extract be used for other diseases?Papaya syrup is also effective in the treatment of cancer as it improves their blood counts. Papaya leaf also has cancer curing properties.��Q �What was the response from the international community?After my research was published in Lankapuwath, it received international acclaim even from BBC and CNN. BBC correspondent Chris Howell visited my lab and did a documentary. As a result the research results spread and people from around the world started using it as a remedy. In many countries it was found to be effective and as consequently there was research conducted in India, Pakistan, Malaysia and even in the University of Florida. We have more than 20 research projects conducted worldwide with regard to this subject. Articles on the preparation of the papaya leaf medicine and its effectiveness have been discussed in length in the British Medical Journal.�The institute of medical research Malaysia encourages and recommends the use of papaya leaf syrup. They even have a video on their website, where they present how the juice is prepared. It should also be noted that this is the first time in the world history that a herbal medicine is being promoted by the government Medical Research Institute.�Q �What advice would you give dengue patients?Dengue is �potentially a serious illness. You must consult your doctor immediately if there are signs of fever, headache and body pain, you can request for an NS1 antigen test. Through this test you can diagnose dengue on the very first day of the illness. If results are positive you can take papaya leaf syrup, in addition to the usual dengue management. Papaya leaf syrup should be taken as early as possible, preferably at the first spike of fever and continued until the patient has recovered fully. Papaya leaf is only a supportive treatment and is mandatory �that you take advice and treatment from an allopathic doctor or from a government hospital. You should not take any type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen, mefenamic acid or diclofinac sodium for fever or body pain.�Listed below are some links and websites where one can receive precise details on the preparation of the syrup and its effectiveness.�� �� �IMPA.LK.ORG� �� �Guidelines in using carica papaya leaf extract for dengue- An article by the British Medical Journal ( link address- http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4661/rr-4)� �� �Institute of Medical Research Malaysia ( http://www.imr.gov.my/en/highlights-featured-articles/2245-carica-papaya-extract-for-dengue-treatment.html) �Pics by Pradeep Dilrukshana�",dengue
How dengue will lose its sting - EDITORIAL,"2016-04-02 00:03:12							0						 				2220","As the week long national dengue prevention week ended yesterday, stinging figures were given by the Epidemiology Unit. It said that from January to March this year, 13,275 suspected dengue cases were reported from all parts of the country. About 52.50% of dengue cases were reported from the Western Province. The Unit said, it was essential to remove possible mosquito breeding sites and advised patients to seek medical attention in the event of fever by day three of the illness.�The Health Ministry said countrywide cleaning campaigns on identified mosquito breeding sites were carried out. It said awareness programmes were also conducted out with the aim of eradicating the dengue epidemic before the monsoon comes in the next few months. The Ministry said it hoped to check more than one million premises by deploying 3,100 teams of officials coordinated by the National Dengue Prevention Programme and the Presidential Task Force on Dengue Fever.�How successful this dengue prevention programme was will be known in the coming weeks and months but city and urban residents say that the main culprits are Municipal or urban Council authorities who appear to be failing miserably in their public duty to clear garbage, clean drains and other breeding sites. President Maithripala Sirisena in a talk last Sunday urged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the cabinet to ensure that state institutions including those run by local councils functioned more efficiently using the latest technology and other creative methods. But over the past few decades the attitude in most state departments and institutions has been irresponsible or lackadaisical. They are known as public servants but most of them behave like lords and masters especially when poor people come to the institutions sometimes from distant areas. Thus the tragedy is that the public service has today become a heavily politicized government service. We hope the President, the Prime Minister and the national government will succeed in their mission to transform state institutions and make them more people-friendly, enterprising, innovative and creative. If not they should be handed over to efficient private sector enterprises because the priority is service to the people.�As revealed in the latest figures, the Western Province is the worst offender and the worst affected by dengue. Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya told a meeting in Kotte on Thursday that by next year there would be no garbage dumps in the province. He said high technology would be used to convert the garbage and turn waste into something valuable. We hope the government keeps such promises. Otherwise most of the leaders will end up in the garbage dumps of history, as did the leaders of the former regime.�With the Zika virus � a deadlier mosquito-borne disease which leads to the birth of children with brain problems -- spreading across some 39 countries mainly in South America, Sri Lanka while being alert to possible Zika cases needs to give more priority to the battle against dengue. For instance the government needs to direct state television channels run with public funds to give prime time status to dengue awareness or prevention. �These channels at present give their prime time to mega tele-dramas most of which, literary critics say are unrealistic and not in line with the hallowed culture and traditions of this country. The state TV channels might say they make big profits from these tele-dramas but making profits by corrupting moral values is a questionable approach. If the state TV channels give prime time to health and education awareness programmes the private channels also might follow.�We also appeal to patriotic citizens. Whatever the government or the local councils do or fail to do, the citizens themselves need to ensure that their houses and gardens do not have any breeding sites for dengue mosquitoes. If millions of families do this in a spirit of civic consciousness the dengue menace will lose its sting.�",dengue
SLAVF to support development and economy in the country,"2016-04-01 00:20:05							0						 				1812","The Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force (SLAVF), a reserve force component of the Sri Lanka Army is celebrating its 135th anniversary this year.The SLAVF is a collective name for the reserve units and the Sri Lanka National Guard of the Sri Lankan Army. It is made up of part-time officers and soldiers paid at a similar rate, while engaged on military activities, as their regular equivalents.�The SLAVF with its inexplicable contribution to the development of the nation, ever since its early beginnings as a small force has grown to 101 battalions consisting of 2,838 officers and 68,449 other ranks deployed across the country.In 1910 the name of the military was formerly changed to the Ceylon Defence Force (CDF). During the First World War, many volunteers from the Defence Force travelled to England and joined the British Army. In 1939 with the Second World War CDF was mobilised and expanded to fortify Ceylon to meet a possible threat posed by the Japanese.�The CDF was officially disbanded in 1949 and reconstituted by Army Act No. 17 of 1949 which revoked the Ceylon Defence Force Ordinance of 1910 as the Ceylon Volunteer Force (CVF), itself becoming the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force (SLAVF) in 1972.�Following the formation of the army in 1949, the CDF became the nucleus of the Ceylon Army and all volunteer units of the CDF�which was the majority of the CDF� became the Ceylon Volunteer Force (CVF).�Since 1983 till 18 May 2009, 104 Officers and 3550 Other Ranks have paid the supreme sacrifice whilst 146 Officers and 3568 Other Ranks have been wounded. In this 08 Officers and 252 Other Ranks are missing in action.Since 2004 up to date 76 Officers and 1518 Other Ranks of Volunteer Force have participated for United Nation Peacekeeping Missions in Haiti. �Increasing the number of SLAVF members AT UN Peacekeeping force in another objective of the SLAVF.�Commandant and Deputy Commandant of the SLAVFThe commandant of the SLAVF is chosen from the SL Army Regular Force and the volunteers could only go higher to the rank of Major General as at present. ��Major General H.C.P. Goonetilleke was appointed Commandant of the SLAVF in 2015. He enlisted in the Sri Lanka Army on 1981 having completed his primary and secondary education at St Benedict�s College and Royal College. He was commissioned in the Corps of Engineers as a Second Lieutenant in 1982.Major General WDLP Wickramasinghe, the Deputy Commandant of the SLAVF have assumed Office in 2012. He joined the SLAVF as a Cadet Officer in 1979 and was commissioned as Second Lieutenant into 2 Battalion of Sri Lanka Army Service Corps (Volunteer) in 1980.�Major General Goonetilleke said being a head of a volunteering force is much more significant than in a Regular Force. It gives you more exposure. �D. S. Senanayake, first Prime Minister of Ceylon and General Sir John Kotelawala, third Prime Minister was products of the volunteering force and served immensely to the motherland. ��The fighting spirit and the adaptability are two key components of the success of the SLAVF that represents 70,000 out of the 180,000 SL Army and from that 70,000 about 15% are engaged in various other jobs. There is no major difference between the Regular Force and the Volunteer Force. They both have given their lives and commitment to the country special during the war. The difference between the Regular force and Volunteer force is that SLAV members could shift to another job while been at the volunteer force.Throughout our 135 history, the SLAVF had contributed in safeguarding the country and in the future, the mission of SLVAF will be to contribute to the development of the country to improve the economy.The SL Army is transforming into a Knowledge Based Technology Driven Force, therefore, the SLAVF would also have to adjust. To do that the SLAVF had opened its doors to professionals,� he said.A tree planting campaign by 100 battalions of the Volunteer Force with each battalion planting and nurturing 135 area specific plants, maintaining 100 Battalions Headquarters as dengue free zones and combating non communicable disease among the rank and file would be organised at the commemoration.�",dengue

Can umpires make fair decisions on Indian soil?,"2016-03-17 00:01:57							0						 				3330","Cricket is becoming more a sub continent game - sympathies are with its neighbours. Do brother, as dictated or prepare to be beheaded.India milks cricket as its cash-cow contrived by its selected team of commentators on television that rule the roost by softening the ugly image to give it an appearance of a venerated Nandi Bull in a mock sporting pose - a deserving mascot in this televised-age of capsulated Bollywood cricket.A traditional Indian cricket fan is a walking talking encyclopaedia on cricket - a miniature Wisden edition: So unlike the cricket crazy instant adherents of the wagering game.�Result orientation of winning is a national psychosis on which Board of Control For Cricket [BCCI] rules the cricketing world making umpiring decisions zany on bi-lateral fixtures where India participates by discarding the Umpire Decision Review System [DRS] universally adopted by test playing countries.Can India afford to lose on its home soil in Twenty/20 World Cup where defeat can lead to damaging the homes of non-performing players? Newspapers reported so on M.S. Dhoni after a defeat at a world cup. Shame knowing his contribution to cricket.Television modulate Indian minds and pick their purses with the back hand at India�s Premier League [IPL], brainchild of BCCI to become the cheer leader in the non � pedigreed version of cricket: More in its administration and at spoken wisdom on televised talk shows than on the playing field or in a cricket academies, in a game where money talks tall.�Till Indians at the turnstile becomes bored with an overdose of wild hits that provide happy times for folk at crammed stadia giving an opportunity to cheer lustily for the national motif; hopefully India will not joy kill cricket with its notorious overkill.There are no level playing fields when BCCI assumes leadership with biased umpires, media moguls, Bollywood sponsors re-writing the rulebook of the MCC and gambling syndicates making cricket a breeding ground of corruption on a dengue proportion that needed the intervention of its supreme court to pull it out of its overflow on a gutter run.�Every country that plays Test cricket agrees to the Umpires Review System [DRS] as the preferred mode except for India but in cricketing terms the minority rules the game since it follows the capitalist trend of being attracted to the fattened marketed products � quality cricket in its purity tamely comes a distant second. The DRS that was previously used at multi lateral cricketing events was discarded at the Asia Cup 2016[Sri Lanka stood firm on DRS with commentators Russell Arnold and Rohan Abeysinghe standing up as true lions without being offensive].�At whose insistence did host Bangladesh scrap it in 2016? At bilateral series where India plays DRS is outlawed. Mandarins at the MCC - the discarded home of aged cricket - is snoozing on the price of a devalued rupee. ESPN, Sri Lanka and the MCC need an upright �Fidel� but the surname should read �Castro�.Take an instance for an illustration at the last Asia Cup: Sri Lanka was coasting to a respectable score against India with Thisara Perera repeatedly taking the ariel route successfully, when he was adjudged stumped by Dhoni.�A much delayed replay showed Perera safely home with the bat well grounded but there was no referral sought by the leg umpire who was sure of his �decision�. The rope trick had prevented a review by the player and Perera walked away without a dissent in fear of a fine or forfeiture. Umpire suffered no pain of mind, however warped his decision was, he was not subject to any discomfort as the match referee was rendered powerless as against wrong decisions of the officiating umpire.He is made a demigod in non- godly clothing. Captains match report is not made public or the deliberations of the umpires review committee. It is the spectator who must be confident of the decisions made on the field if he is to revisit the game of cricket that must never appear to have an image of a fixed game. Losing a place in the elite panel is a belated judgment on a party more wrong than wronged.Love or Hate -Twenty Cricket has come of age. A match of a 40 over duration at a T20 World Cup fixture draws larger crowds than 5 aggregated days of test cricket (Except at the Melbourne Cricket Grounds during a rare Ashes game) where a minimum of 80 overs play is guaranteed.�Capsulated intense cricket thrives and more on a home watch on commercial television that keeps alive the spirit of cricket swashed with money - a game otherwise played in front of bare stadiums with the few present occupying complimentary seating and a free lunch.In a keenly contested T/20 match, a game will be won or lost on a disputable no ball, several touch and go wides, doubtful run outs-each an incident where the umpire places a critical crucial role including the many leg before decisions that can mar a match on the verdict of�umpiring errors.�This comedy of errors can be rectified with Decision Review System [DRS] accepted by all cricket-playing countries except India. Majority rule is absent in the democracy that BCCI rules.None come to watch an umpire at work unless a decision is sent for a review. Crowd reaction tells the rest when the decision is made known. Which is preferable? A singular exclusive determination by a solitary umpire where an unseen human factor can be a consideration in casino India or the same umpire makes a decision with a multitude of tested gadgetry that is less prone to error assisted by another umpire to offer guidance.It is not a case of a two- bench decision being more acceptable than the verdict one supremo but the paraphernalia technically tested available on the call of the umpire for further clarification purifies the decision. It enhances on- field cordiality between opposing players, as decisions are deemed less spurious- often a vexatious point of debate.�The spirit of the game must be maintained for the paying /watching spectators as a verdict deemed fair makes a game on; more than the juvenile count from ten downwards to play on: except in centres where a loss wounds the pride of a nation. Umpire is an over protected species in the name of the game. Need we the phrase-�it�s not cricket�- without the additional flow of words �when it is played as in India�?Umpires are a honest tribe with 93% of their decisions being spot on; 5% is dreadfully wrong especially when DRS is not used on the objection of one competing country wistfully on an umpire�s off day. One grunt is sufficient for a batsman to be punished for dissent against an umpire�s decision. Compare it with sports such as rugby, tennis or football or words originating from the lips of a fast bowler to a batsman on strike.�Never to an umpire who never waves a yellow card; but can dispatch to Siberia like the great Muralithran once was. [Wisden Almanac of 2002 named him the �greatest bowler�].�His name is engraved in halls of fame while has any heard of an umpire named Mr. Ross Emerson, no balled Muralitharan for throwing including on his non controversial leg break? Emerson is not in to cricket anymore but taken to swimming. �Come on Aussie� that booed Murali never had a stricture but the Aussie media lampooned Arjuna Ranatunge.�Who had the last laugh-umpire or victimised player?The public school concept that �umpire is always right� is followed in an old boy society that has read of cricket from the time of umpires Frank Chester to Darrel Hair. That was an age where the white man ruled the laws of cricket and it was tuned to suit them till brown sahibs of the sub continent took over on finding their bread being buttered creamier.This is a liberal age when rule of law permits criticism of judges and their judicial interpretations provided it is not malicious or contemptuous, on the belief the quality of the law enhances with criticism. All judges are beneath the law unlike umpires that can claim divine rights of being infallible. Cricket has decreed umpires� are the sacred cows on a playing field.Let it be seen enacted live on Indian soil at the World Cup 2016. Be fair to postpone the decision until the last ball is bowled. Umpires know India objects to DRS but do they have a choice at multi lateral events on their soil to discard a peep at varied facilities on offer. If India led at other sports with finance and fame, rules of modern Olympics would need to be redefined.Cricket is becoming more a sub continent game - sympathies are with its neighbours. Do brother, as dictated or prepare to be beheaded.��",dengue
Top billionaires on mission to save Planet Earth - EDITORIAL,"2016-03-02 00:28:24							0						 				2074","With Planet Earth facing its worst ever ecological catastrophe, some of the world�s super-billionaires led by Microsoft founder Bill Gates have come forward to invest hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change and discover or develop renewable sources of clean energy.��The world�s big companies and multi-millionaires or billionaires had earlier been content with corporate social responsibility which social justice analysts have described as more or less crumbs-from-the-table cases. � �They make hundreds of millions -- mainly by wheeler-dealer plunder or exploiting workers -- and soothe their conscience by throwing the crumbs to the impoverished people. Having hopefully realized that such selfish greedy and wicked capitalism often throws them into some hellfires, the super-billionaires are now coming forward to help the world make a 180 degrees turn from its path of self-destruction.According to the website Worth, a group of the world�s billionaires have focussed their philanthropy on environmental issues -- climate change, renewable energy, the creation of green cities and species conservation.They include Sir Richard Branson, the Billionaire CEO of the Virgin Group. He devotes much of his time to his philanthropic arm, Virgin Unite, which includes an initiative dedicated to fighting Co2 emissions. Last year Sir Branson announced the Green Capital Global Challenge -- a one year, 10-city programme to increase energy efficiency in the built environment. Sir Branson pledged all profits from Virgin Transportation for the next 10 years to developing green energy. In 2007 he launched the Virgin Green Fund to support renewable energy investments, and announced his USD $25 million prize for any technology that can safely remove carbon from the atmosphere.Also involved is Ted Turner. The erstwhile media mogul first displayed his passion for environmental philanthropy with the establishment of his organization committed to maintaining the planet�s natural resources. Mr. Turner has set apart funds to reduce the global threat from nuclear chemical and biological weapons launched the Turner Endangered Species Fund to promote biodiversity and conservation and created the Captain Planet Foundation which includes the hit TBS show Captain Planet to encourage children to become environmental stewards.The next is George Soros. Since the �70s Mr. Soros, the Hungarian-born hedge fund manager has donated more than $7 billion to various philanthropic endeavours, and in recent years his attention has turned to environmentalism. In 2009, �Mr. Soros announced the foundation of his new global climate watchdog group, the Climate Policy Initiative, which he will fund to the tune of $100 million over the next 10 years. Next is Jeff Skoll. The filmmaker founded Participant Media, which produces socially conscious films and documentaries, often paired with social actions to encourage audiences to participate and make a difference. His credits include former US vice President Al Gore�s An Inconvenient Truth. Mr. Skoll has also handed out grants to 72 social entrepreneurs. Headquartered in Silicon �Valley, the Skoll Foundation seeks to create a sustainable future through social entrepreneurship, with particular emphasis on climate change, water scarcity, pandemics and nuclear proliferation.�On the other side of the world, we have Zhengrong Shi. He earned his PHD in Australia at the University of New South Wales School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering. Mr. Shi returned to China in 2001 to set up Suntech Power, the largest manufacturer of photovoltaic cells for solar technology in the world. One of the richest men in China, Mr. Shi has donated considerable funds for renewable energy research to his Alma mater. He also gifted a Suntech solar array to the Sydney Theatre Company�s new Wharf Theatre. Using advanced crystalline silicon solar technologies, the project recently broke the world record for the highest conversion efficiency.�The initiator of the mission is Bill Gates. His Philanthropic focus can be measured by the kinds of insects he releases at the annual TED conference. In 2014, it was mosquitoes to raise awareness about malaria or dengue. Last year, fireflies to demonstrate the need for energy miracles to combat climate change. Mr. Gates is officially switching gears from vaccines and seeds to energy and climate to realize his goal of a fossil-fuel-free 2050. We hope other corporate giants and company owners would also join this battle to save Planet Earth, so that world governments also would be encouraged to go beyond populist short-term policies and experience ecological conversion.�",dengue

Stagnant lives of  the Meeriyabadda landslide victims Women and children most vulnerable,"2016-01-11 18:39:22							0						 				1966","Victims of any natural disaster� are in a state of shock, panic, stressed out and helpless. They live with trauma.� Women� and children are often vulnerable in this context and face many discomforts, especially those relating to sanitary facilities and living conditions. In an attempt to find out what life is like in the aftermath of a natural disaster,� the Daily Mirror spoke to victims of the Meeriyabadda landslide.�We live in a world where humanitarian crises extract mounting costs from economies, communities and individuals. Wars and natural disasters make the headlines, at least initially. Less visible but also costly are the crises of fragility, vulnerability and growing inequality, confining millions of people to the most tenuous hopes for peace and development� � Shelter from the Storm�Shelter from the Storm�� - A transformative agenda for women and girls in a crisis-prone world� -� a report that was recently released by the UNFPA state of world population 2015 throws light upon the many millions of victims who have faced crises across the world and how they have been affected directly and indirectly. It reveals that more than 100 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, 29 million of them being women and adolescent girls of reproductive age.According to the report, while the number of natural disasters� tripled during the past 20 years, for each person who dies in a disaster, there are a hundred more� affected by it. Although only 44% of the disasters have taken place in developing countries, 68% of deaths have occurred there. Those who undergo such adversities are left homeless, separated from families, orphaned, diseased and have limited opportunities of living their usual lives again.It is certainly true that women and children are the most vulnerable. As Shelter from the Storm demonstrates, while men are much more likely to be directly affected, women die or are otherwise harmed more often of indirect causes. Females have a higher tendency to be internally displaced persons and refugees, and are often subjected to gender-based violence.�	The grievances of the Meeriyabadda landslide victimsThis is no different in Sri Lanka which is prone to both natural and man-made disasters. Sri Lankans are still recovering from the gruesome memories of the thirty-year ethnic conflict. Many of its victims are still displaced and are waiting to start their lives afresh.When the Daily Mirror visited the abandoned tea factory in Meeriyabadda, which currently houses the victims of last year�s disaster, their� situation was quite pathetic. Out of� 310 inhabitants belonging to 88 families, the Daily Mirror spoke to a few women giving them an opportunity to tell the world what their life was like. �Wijekumar Chandra, a 29-year-old woman, was eager to speak about her difficulties, with her two children by her side.�They promised to give us houses in 3 months. It has been more than a year now, but we are still stuck here. My husband was a goldsmith, and I used to work at an apparel industry in Colombo. My mother and elder sister used to look after our children when we were working. We lost them both in the landslide. Now I work as a domestic and keep my younger son with me. My husband is farming now. He is not used to it, but since we lost all utensils, we have no other option.��	Their careers have been put on hold, along with� their former lifestylesWhile some are under the impression that they can move into their new houses by January next year to celebrate Thai Pongal, some hang on to� the fading promise that at least the Sinhala and Tamil New Year can be celebrated in their own homes.� R. Indrani, carrying� her child in her arms, spoke of the never ending hope of re-settlement.�We have many problems while living here. We receive a voucher of Rs. 1500 per week. That is not at all sufficient to feed a family of four. They could have given us a house� at least within 6 months, when it wasn�t raining. But they didn�t start construction� back then. We all joined a campaign asking for the replacements last month. Although work was restarted after the clamour, they cannot continue properly because of the rain. At election times of course we were given many words of assurance.� The extents of their hardships were� reflected in these heart-rending stories. Wijelechchami was trying to put her granddaughter Thilakshani to sleep in a makeshift cradle as we approached her. The little baby�s mother has gone abroad to make money. The father of the child, she says, died before the baby was born.�What we want is a house of our own. These children often get sick here, because of the lack of hygiene, bad water and the cold weather. When it rains, the room is flooded with water because the roof is cracked. Only God knows the hardships we go through. My daughter never wanted to leave her children behind, but she has to fly overseas because we need the money to survive.�Shanthi Malar, a 24-year-old maiden, lives with her elder brother�s family, packed in one room. She was cooking her afternoon meal in the middle of the room as we spoke to her. When questioned about the sanitary health problems that women like herself are confronted with, this is what she had to say:�Old and young women, and little children, all use the same toilets built a few metres away. They are not clean at all. We don�t have a means of discarding sanitary napkins. Some dump them in the toilets, which sometimes spark rows among the women here. Thankfully no one has got pregnant yet, or else it would be a disaster to take care of a new born kid here. It is difficult for us women to change clothes as we all live together. Privacy is a luxury we can�t afford.�Marimuththu Raja was looking after his three children, aged 2, 7, and 9, playing on the floor inside their room. He said that they are vulnerable to many diseases. �My children survive according to the medicines given. There is a doctor who visits us on a regular basis, but that doesn�t stop the children from getting caught to all the contagious diseases that spread across the camp. We try to take care of each and every one living here and attend to women�s special needs, but there is so much to do. I also believe that having our own place will solve the existing problems to a great extent.� Kandaiah Mariya, Kanagalechchami and Kalaimagar were three more women who were facing trouble due to these inconveniences. They shared the following with us;														�There are 6 people in my family;� at the time of the disaster I was abroad. However I came back within 20 days and found my family.� We were treated badly from the beginning. Today, although we live here we are facing many problems. For example the toilet pits are overflowing and the children have to live in very unhygienic conditions. After some time the owner of the estate was diagnosed with dengue and then the Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) came here and went on a full inspection. We also contracted diseases such as chicken pox, flu and other illnesses but not a single PHI came here initially. But everybody gets royal treatment except for us. The weekly coupon is also not sufficient for us at times. For those doing a job this may not be critical,� but many of us are unemployed.� �				S. Kalaimagar			�															So far we haven�t received any complaints: Nimal Abeysiri								In order to find out what action has been taken to relocate these victims, the spoke to Daily Mirror Nimal Abeysiri, the District Secretary of the Badulla district. In his comments, Mr. Abeysiri said that these victims obviously have to go through many hardships. �We are doing everything within our capacity to provide them with good living conditions. Actually speaking, the facilities and aid they receive at the camp are far better than what they had. The people involved in politics who give many promises leave them with high hopes. There is so much we can do. We are only coordinators and we do our best. So far no one has come to us complaining about anything.� Having asked about the delay of the resettlements, Mr. Abeysiri told that the constructions are not easy, especially in these areas. They have been delayed due to reasons that are beyond our control. The boulders have to be cracked in order to make space for the construction, and that should be done using chemicals and huge machines. It is a long process. We have completed building 47 houses. Hopefully by March 2016, the resettlements will be complete. These houses are luxuries compared to what the affected people had because they comprise of tiled bathrooms, double rooms, kitchens, proper water supply and other amenities.��			�															We need to consider more about the sanitary facilities of women and children: Shamila Daluwatte								Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Attorney-at-law and women�s rights activist Shamila Daluwatte said that in most instances women and children have to face many inconveniences when it comes to a natural disaster. �While distributing lunch packets and other relief items, people should also consider about the sanitary facilities available to women and children. Therefore, other items such as sanitary napkins, towels and clothes should also be distributed. When these people are displaced they often have to stay together in a hall or other place until they are relocated. This is another situation that we need to look at. Sometimes both men and women will have to use washrooms in close proximity and also take a bath from a common well. This in turn will increase the chances of women being vulnerable to sexual harassment. In addition to that they should be given access to clean water and other needs in order to ensure that they are under good living conditions.�",dengue

"A safe, secure and peaceful environment through: intersectoral action","2015-11-23 19:30:27							0						 				1061","Not many states have been able to live up to this public expectation due to various circumstances	�	reating a safe, secure and peaceful environment in the country is a key responsibility of a modern state. Yet, not many states have been able to live up to this public expectation due to diverse circumstances. Our experience in this country over the last several decades points to the fact that, despite various efforts by state and non-governmental agencies to create a safe, secure and peaceful environment, a large majority of people have not been able to live in such an environment. This is due to a whole range of circumstances such as unsafe roads, insecure neighbourhoods, conflictual inter- community relations, environment related health risks, violent homes, public nuisances and widespread crime. All these issues are closely linked to diverse sectors that come under the purview of a range of institutions. Yet, when the problems become acute, threatening the well being of people, governments and the wider public tend to focus attention on the security establishments. A clear case in point is the dengue threat in Sri Lanka.Though this is essentially an issue connected with the poor management of the built environment, the dengue prevention has become� largely a matter of law enforcement, making the Police responsible for its containment. While in actual fact, the dengue epidemic is the result of the failure of many state policies, institutions and interventions, apprehension and prosecution of neighbourhood offenders has become the main focus of attention of the media and the public. On the other hand, it is common sense that we need to manage our built environment well through better housing, sanitation, land use and other policies.What is true for the dengue epidemic is equally true for student unrest, child abuse, domestic violence, crime, alcohol and drug abuse, ethnic violence, road accidents, etc. In each of these cases, law enforcement is important but the policies and interventions in diverse sectors such as education, roads, employment, transport, social welfare, reconciliation, housing, local government and health are definitely more important than police action. In other words, we need to adopt an intersectoral approach to dealing with a whole range of seemingly law enforcement issues such as the ones mentioned above. Why is this important ?�	""Law enforcement is important but the policies and interventions in� diverse sectors such as education, roads, employment, transport, social� welfare, reconciliation, housing, local government and health are� definitely more important than police action""�				Many academics often tend to think out of the box. Yet, institutional development around modern states has tended to create ever more specialized agencies either around individual issues or diverse functions. The result is a proliferation of institutions and, in this country , cabinet ministries. Once these are established either by statute or by� executive action, they become mini fiefdoms of either politicians, state officials or vested interests. A clear case in point today is that there are two ministries and a high powered national outfit to address issues of reconciliation. The result is that, leaving aside the critical need to come up with an integrated national plan of action to promote national integration, turf wars between different institutions are already in full swing. The danger is that, at the end, we will have everything but national reconciliation. What is true of national reconciliation is also true for a whole host of other critical areas. It is to avoid such a disastrous situation that, we at the Campaign for Sound National Policies (CSNP) proposed not only a rational framework for the formation of the Cabinet but also a system of clustering of closely inter-connected ministries in order to facilitate an integrated approach to policy development and program implementation. But, as usual, pragmatic party politics and vested interests prevented�� rational decision making leading to serious adverse consequences that we witness with sadness and dismay today. The reason for this situation is clear. We elevated politicians� to such a high level of importance in this country that everybody else, including experts became unimportant. As a result, politicians often make uninformed and irrational decisions the adverse consequences of which we all have to live with. As is well known, the country�s economy is in bad shape today largely due to� blunders of politicians in the recent past. Unfortunately, this political tradition cannot be easily changed, unless politicians develop a higher level of tolerance for expert advice. But the media and the highly politicized vested interests are unlikely to help change this situation. You only have to watch a few television talk shows to realize the pathetic situation. They are often dominated by all knowing politicians and journalists.�		""Pragmatic party politics and vested interests prevented�� rational� decision making leading to serious adverse consequences that we witness� with sadness and dismay today. The reason for this situation is clear""If we return to the theme of this article briefly, it is clear that creating a safe, secure and peaceful environment in the country is as important as economic development. This is possible only if we establish close collaboration across a range of institutions, both state and non-state, in order to share information, knowledge, human and material resources and come up with joint action plans. Such collective thinking and action can stem many problems connected with safety, security and peace in the country. A clear case in point is child protection. It is better to work together and prevent child abuse rather than spend all our time and resources to deal with a horrendous crime committed against an innocent child. We have the institutions, resources and ideas to do this. It is just that we have not done it. It is time to make a beginning, at least at this late hour.",dengue

DNA testing in the 21st Century,"2015-11-11 18:30:05							0						 				1808","Q �How difficult or easy is it to find evidence at a scene of crime?During DNA based crime investigations at least 25 biological samples can be found from a scene of crime. These include hair shafts, faecal matter, body organs and many more. Forensics rely on a fundamental theory which states that �every contact leaves a trace�, as suggested by French forensic scientist, Edmond Locard. Therefore there is something called intimate contact with three parts, mainly people, places and objects. We call this trace material transfer. Therefore 2-3 objects can be used as trace evidence to track suspects connected with the crime. Biological samples which have DNA in them could be tested to identify criminals beyond reasonable doubt. DNA investigations are nearly 100% accurate.			Q What services are offered by GeneTech?GeneTech has been in existence for more than 13 years founded�by Dr Maiya Gunasekara, specializing in three key aspects that make use of DNA testing. One is for criminal investigations, the other is to establish�family relationships which come under civil cases and the third is in disease diagnostics. Nearly 4000 criminal cases were taken up including cases of theft, robbery, sexual abuse and rape. Under civil cases we have taken up nearly 6500 such cases. Civil cases are mainly to establish the maternal and paternal relationships. Over the 13 years we have tested over 15000 biological samples generating large amounts of data. DNA profiles are unique. All our tests are done according to recommended ISO standards and any student who has a Bachelors or a postgraduate degree can be recruited but they will be trained for a certain period of time. Not only do we have a diagnostic lab but we also participate in research activities where we too have a good chance to develop our methods. DNA testing has evolved so rapidly that today we have many techniques practised in other countries and have in turn given a boost to Research and Development in the country.			Q �Can you give some examples of special cases?The case of Tsunami baby 81, Royal Park murder, Sarath Ambepitiya case and Kotakethana murders.�				Q �At the scene of a crime, how are these materials collected without damage?�There are especially trained police officers called Scene of Crime Officers (SOCO) who handle evidence at a scene of crime. We have trained the entire SOCO force in identifying, handling and preserving evidence. Depending on the specimen, the method�of collecting the sample is different. Biological samples should be taken care of because of degradation. For example, if one is collecting a blood stain on a cloth, it should be left to dry. Similarly in the case of flesh, it should be preserved at -200C and during transit; the sample should be kept in ice.�			Q � In the case of manipulations?�People who are dealing with these cases work to a certain standard. Therefore it is highly unlikely that there would be any manipulations. Once the courts request that a DNA testing should be done, the samples are taken to a DNA lab. Without the request from courts a DNA test cannot be done. As I mentioned there can be 25 different samples of biological evidence. In addition to that we can also collect physical circumstantial evidence such as a shirt button, piece of cloth, footprint, tyre tracks, a piece of thread and the like. A single person can shed at least 100 hair samples a day. Yes there are times when suspects try to hide important evidence by burning dead bodies and doing such unethical things. Yet if I take an example, there were two bodies which were burnt during the Kotakethana murders. When we closely examined, we were able to recover sperm samples from the charred bodies.			Q �Other than GeneTech, what other authorities conduct DNA testing and crime based investigations?The Government Analyst�s Department and the Ragama Medical faculty too are involved in conducting these tests. For example at GeneTech we conduct DNA testing for disease diagnostics. Therefore in the case of a dengue patient, the routine test takes up to 3-4 days. But at GeneTech the report can be taken within 24 hours. As such you can diagnose 80 such infectious diseases through DNA testing.�",dengue
"Speeding up regulation will help GSK innovate, drive more science-backed products in Sri Lanka: CEO","2015-11-10 18:30:00							0						 				1751","GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Sri Lanka CEO Sunil Mehra says GSK has been in Sri Lanka for almost 60 years. GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK) is a British-based multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in London. It is the fifth-largest pharmaceutical company in the world.In the current context, what are some of the challenges faced by GlaxoSmithKline�Sri Lanka?�GSK has been in Sri Lanka for almost 60 years. In the last 60 years, we have invested significantly in our brands and also set up local manufacturing. Government authorities and regulators have been very supportive of our local manufacturing operations.�We do believe that the economic development in the country, with a high focus on infrastructure development, increasing skill sets, increasing per capita income and reducing cost of living, will only throw up new opportunities for us in the future.�We are hopeful that over a period of time, high taxes and duties on material cost and finished goods cost will be rationalised. This will go a long way to help the business grow further. Relaxation and speeding up of the regulatory requirements will also help us to innovate as fast as we could and drive more science-backed products in Sri Lanka.�How much of value addition is done in Sri Lanka compared to five years ago? Is GSK consumer poised for long-term growth or does the company face a crisis because of a depreciating rupee?�Though we are a global company our operations in a country are very local. Over the years we have immersed ourselves completely with the local culture shaping our journey with the local nuances. This is reflected in our robust brands, developed on strong local insights. We have a very high per capita consumption for many of our brands in this market.�We invested heavily over the last five years in the local manufacturing for Panadol, Eno and Iodex. As the market leader in pain relief, we are the only multinational with local manufacturing capabilities.�Sri Lanka is a key market within the Indian Subcontinent. In the global context, we are an emerging market and therefore need to be a growth driver. We believe we can be the first and best fast-moving consumer healthcare company in Sri Lanka, driven by science and values.What does being number one in the paracetamol drug category mean to you and the business?�It is an honour to be the market leader in pain relief in Sri Lanka. It shows the tremendous faith that the consumers and the medical fraternity have in our products.�Panadol has been a trusted pain reliever for almost every Sri Lankan at any given time. This is a clear articulation of our global vision of bringing relevant and science-backed products to consumers so that they do more, feel better and live longer.�As a market leader, it�s also important to do business and market our products responsibly. We have introduced many firsts to the market, such as �Dosage by Weight� for Panadol for Children and �Child Resistant Caps�. We will continue to deliver a healthy supply of our products and drive responsible medication in Sri LankaHow strong are your brands in the nutritional category?�The country�s nutritional landscape is still in the growing phase and there�s clear opportunity for a science-based healthcare portfolio to emerge.We have very strong brands in our nutritional portfolio, which were developed by Global R&D experts based on local consumer insights and needs. We believe our brands need to connect beyond a product experience and instead become part of people�s daily lives.Today the nutritional business is about 50 percent of our portfolio and we believe it�s one of our growth engines for the future.In the nutritional portfolio, Viva plays an important role in giving energy for young adults to do more and go that extra mile in seizing every opportunity in life. We recently launched a new Ginger variant in Viva, keeping the Sri Lankan consumer�s palate and preferences in mind.Horlicks is positioned as a specialist product to enhance the goodness of milk and help children between the ages of six to 16 years achieve full potential in their development. � ��GSK dental products are very popular globally. How strong are they locally and do you see potential for these products?�Globally GSK has driven the specialist categories in addressing unfulfilled needs of oral hygiene conditions, such as sensitivity and gum health.In Sri Lanka, we have been catering to the therapeutic sensitivity segment, creating a niche for ourselves, in just five years. Today GSK owns 5 percent of the overall toothpaste market for Sensodyne.�We have been very successful as a fast moving consumer healthcare company, backed by GSK�s expert credentials and consumer marketing capabilities. This model has been proven globally and we have all the confidence that Sri Lanka too will be a category success in the near future.What are some of your CSR initiatives that can and will help you to connect with society and thereby become socially relevant?�Our purpose of existence itself is to help people to do more, feel better and live longer. The products we market genuinely connect with this purpose. We have two unique community partnering initiatives at GSK, helping our employees to connect with the larger society.Our focus for CSR is education and children. Hence, we select CSR projects under these two pillars.GSK Orange day is a day where employees on a dedicated paid day, get to contribute to the wider society. Every year, our employees identify a worthy cause and spend the day helping a community enhance their wellbeing and lives.GSK�s PULSE programme sees employees given the opportunity to work for selected NGOs to support the NGO in providing a better service to the community. In addition to these two programmes, employees are encouraged to do skills volunteering to build capabilities in various communities. Some of our managers support university students as mentors. We also do career guidance programmes for students to offer them a better understanding about career options in the private sector.We partner with local universities to provide in-house training opportunities for students to acquire experience in the corporate sector. We also provide support for service learning projects for university students to develop a community partnership �gene� at an early stage in life.We also connect with the community by partnering with local bodies for periodic dengue eradication programmes.What are some of the processes you have within GSK to develop exceptional managers with a distinct set of talents?�The GSK Leadership Development Framework connects the processes, tools and programmes in a comprehensive approach to achieve personal development.�There is a clear focus for Differentiated Development, ensuring that all employees have an individual development plan that will stretch them in an appropriate way, considering their performance over time and their potential, as well as their individual aspirations. Focus is also on the 70/20/10 development principles, with on the job experiences, blended with interactions and relationships with people, supported by formal instruction or access to learning resources, all underpinned by support from the line manager.CLEAR (Competencies, Leadership, Experience and Results) profiles provide a good understanding to our employees regarding the technical and behavioural and leadership competencies they need to develop, to accomplish their career aspirations. We also encourage and provide exposure to global roles to enhance the capabilities and skills of our next generation leaders.�How are you coping with the current�talent shortage?�GSK employee value proposition (EVP) which revolves around four pillars - Development, Purpose, World-class Performance, Best Working Environment - support us to attract the best talent in the market.�We also recruit entry level employees and develop them within the organisation to ensure that we build required capabilities to fulfil our talent needs. We further connect with and conduct various programmes to attract the best talent from the top universities.Finally, in your two years in Sri Lanka what have you learned about the Sri Lankan management practices?The strong collaborative GSK culture is geography agnostic and embeds us easily in any situation. My tenure in Sri Lanka has been made easy by the supportive local team who have helped me to learn the cultural nuances and business dynamics within a very short time. I am grateful for this high performance, collaborative team that is geared to scale new heights and take our business to the next level.�(Cathrine Weerakkody is a graduate in financial management from the UK and a CIMA passed finalist)",dengue

In another leap forward, UA conducted a programme for teenagers around the theme of �A Successful Life� on October 8 to commemorate the World Children�s Day. The programme was conducted at the Dharmaraja College Kandy auditorium and was attended by over 300 students from 14 leading schools in the area. �	UA conducted a programme for teenagers around the theme of �A Successful Life� on October 8 to commemorate the World Children�s DayToday�s teenagers are under immense pressure and stress. As a result of not knowing how to process and handle this pressure, many students face hardships in life. It is essential to create awareness, not only among the students � but also among the parents and the teachers, on how to provide the appropriate support for their children who are at a very crucial stage of their lives. UA is taking steps to organise a programme that will reach out to parents and teachers to raise awareness. Further, steps are already on the way to organise programmes in the 14 schools that participated in the flagships programme in the coming year. �Along with these programmes UA also carries out thalassemia awareness programmes with the National Thalassemia Centre. As of now UA and the Thalassemia Centre has organised 42 programmes to educate the public about the thalassemia disease. As it is most effective to test children over the age of 12 for the disease, the company believes that raising awareness among teenagers would prove extremely beneficial for the eradication of Thalassemia. ��The best way to eradicate Thalassemia is to create awareness about the disease. We truly value the support Union Assurance has provided us to help spread the word about the disease.

From scarcity to abundance: Changing  life-styles and NCD epidemic in  Sri Lanka,"2015-10-11 19:47:12							0						 				1927","Health scientists, policy makers and many others have focused attention on the rising epidemic of non-communicable diseases like heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cancers.�While many communicable diseases have been drastically reduced due to improving living conditions and spread of education, worsening environmental conditions have become a major source of illness as the persisting threat of dengue epidemic shows. On the other hand, rising non-communicable diseases mentioned above have been the direct result of life style changes that followed the social and economic transformation brought about by economic liberalisation since the late 1970�s.As is well known, food habits of Sri Lankans have changed drastically since the late 1970�s. Severe restrictions on food imports in the early 1970�s persuaded most people to eat locally produced food. This situation changed significantly in the years that followed. Increased availability of food due to both the expansion of local production and increasing imports and increasing monetary incomes of a large segment of the population led to a rapid increase in food consumption among non- poor sections of the population.�Much of this increase has happened within a generation. Many people who experienced food shortages during their early years of life could now consume a variety of food items, some of which are full of fat, sugar and starch. The general tendency under such conditions is to engage in unhealthy consumption. For instance, youth from poor rural families moving into urban centres for employment adopt consumption patterns that usually involved alcohol abuse and intake of unhealthy fast food items.�Migrant workers who are on the move over many years of their lives have enough money to eat all kinds of food at their destinations and this can naturally affect their health. Rural and urban migration for work, education and other needs expose many people of all walks of life to new consumption patterns, in particular fast food. Spread of private transport in all parts of the country such as motorcycles and three-wheelers has encouraged most people to avoid walking even in rural areas and this has no doubt contributed to the spread of NCDs.�On the other hand, walking along our roads has become such a risky way of getting around in urban areas as roads are often constructed without adequate pavements. I even wrote several newspaper articles about a decade ago about this insane and inhuman practice of authorities responsible for road building, but the dominant car culture has blinded themselves to this major social issue.�They drive their cars on the roads and use newly built walking tracts for walking. But the hapless masses have no choice but walk all over the place exposing them to grave risks.Our colossal failure to curtail private transport by introducing more efficient mass transit systems is perhaps the main reason for environmental pollution in urban areas today.�While environmental pollution is a major factor in ill health, thousands of people who are killed or injured also add to the rising case load of NCDs.�It is myopic State policies that are behind such tragedies. Political leaders have not only used hard earned public money to import obscenely expensive luxury cars for their own use but also turned a blind eye to public tragedies mentioned above.�	""Our colossal failure to curtail private transport by introducing more efficient mass transit systems is perhaps the main reason for environmental pollution in urban areas today.

It is myopic state policies that are behind such tragedies. Political leaders have not only used hard earned public money to import obscenely expensive luxury cars for their own use but also turned a blind eye to public tragedies mentioned above""Schoolchildren are at particular risk of developing NCDs in their later lives due to both exposure to air pollution and unhealthy food habits. Many of them travel long distances and have to leave home early often without any breakfast. They are given money to buy junk food and sugary drinks. School tuck-shops and nearby boutiques sell food items that are full of sugar, fat and refined wheat flour. Sugary pop-drinks do the rest.�About ten years ago, we from the University of Colombo experimented with the idea of establishing a fruit stall in each school.�The experiment carried out in two schools in Hambantota was successful. We trained two unemployed youth, provided them with the modern equipment necessary to process local fruit. The newly established elegant fruit stall supplied children with a range of fruit products such as juices, milk shakes with fruits and fruit salads. But the authorities at the time did not extend their support to the project and it died a natural death.�If this idea was pursued by educational authorities, we would have by now established fruit stalls in most schools in the country.�Apart from obvious nutritional and health benefits, the massive demand for fruits that the project would have generated could have created many income opportunities for farmers and others involved.The only way to effectively contain the NCD epidemic is to adopt appropriate policies in the relevant sectors such as employment, transport, education, agriculture, physical planning and health. In all these areas, public education is critically important.�But, unfortunately all the effective means of public education are dominated by vested interests such as business firms, politicians, etc. and the masses are only occasionally exposed to saner voices and objective analyses.�Until this situation changes, we will continue to make colossal mistakes and spend many years and billions of rupees to correct them, all at the expense of the well-being of ordinary masses.�",dengue

Well done Sri Lanka,"2015-09-30 20:04:23							0						 				3098","Millennium Development Goals �to �Sustainable Development Goals	Many gaps and challenges remain!Over the weekend of September 25 - 27, the United Nations headquarters in New York hosted the Sustainable Development Summit 2015. It was a high-level segment of the 70th UN General Assembly that was attended by many world leaders including Sri Lanka�s President Maithripala Sirisena.The UN, which turns 70 this year, is once again rallying its member governments to a lofty vision and ambitious goal: to embark on new paths to improve the lives of people everywhere.�For this, the Summit adopted a new and improved global task-list called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Prepared after two years of worldwide consultations, the SDGs offer a blueprint for development until 2030.�There are 17 SDGs tackling long-standing problems like ending poverty and reducing inequality to relatively newer challenges like creating more liveable cities and tackling climate change. These are broken down into 169 specific targets. Their implementation will formally begin on 1 January 2016. The SDGs are to take over from the Millennium Development Goals, or MDGs, that have guided the development sector for 15 years. Sri Lanka was among the 189 countries that adopted the MDGs at the Millennium Summit the UN hosted in New York in September 2000. On that occasion, the country was represented by Lakshman Kadirgamar as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The eight MDGs covered a broad spectrum of goals, from eradicating absolute poverty and hunger to combating HIV, and from ensuring all children attend primary school to saving mothers from dying during pregnancy and childbirth.Much has happened in the nearly 5,500 days separating the adoption of the original MDGs and now, the successor SDGs. This month, as the world commits to �leaving no one behind� (as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said), it is useful to look back, briefly.Good �Report Card�How has Sri Lanka pursued the MDGs while the country coped with a long drawn civil war, political change, and the fall-out of a global economic recession?In fact, it has done reasonably well. In its human development efforts, Sri Lanka has quietly achieved a great deal. However, there are gaps that need attention, and some goals not yet met.That is also the overall message in a recent report that took stock of Sri Lanka�s pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals, or MDGs.We might sum it up with a phrase that teachers are fond of using, even on good students: �You�re doing well � but can do better! Try harder!�For the past 15 years, the MDGs have provided a framework for Sri Lanka�s national development programmes. Progress has been assessed every few years: the most recent �report card� came out in March 2015.The MDG Country Report 2014, prepared by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), is a joint publication by the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations in Sri Lanka. Data from the 2012 census and Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2012/13 have generated plenty of data to assess MDG situation across the country, including the war affected areas.�Sri Lanka has already achieved the targets of 13 important MDG indicators out of 44 indicators relevant to Sri � Lanka. Most of the other indicators are either �On Track� or �progressing well�,� says IPS Executive Director Dr Saman Kelegama in his foreword to the report.Highlights�The report offers insights into how Sri Lanka�s �soft infrastructure� -- all the systems and institutions required to maintain the economic, health, cultural and social standards of a country � are faring.�Consider these highlights:			Sri Lanka�s overall income poverty rates, when measured using accepted statistical benchmarks, have come down from 15.2% in 2006/7 to 6.7% in 2012.�			Unemployment rate has declined from 13.8% in 1993 to 3.9% in 2012. However, unemployment rate among women is twice as high as among men.			While food production keeps up with population growth, malnutrition is a concern. A fifth of all children under five are underweight. And half of all people still consume less than the minimum requirement of daily dietary energy.			Nearly all (99%) school going children enter primary school. At that stage, the numbers of boys and girls are equal. In secondary school and beyond (university), in fact, there now are more girls than boys.			�More babies now survive their first year of life than ever before: infant mortality rate has come down to 9.4 among 1,000 live births (from 17.7 in 1991). Deaths among children under five have also been nearly halved (down from 22.2 in 1991 to 11.3 in 2009).�			Fewer women die needlessly of complications arising from pregnancy and childbirth. The maternal mortality rate, which stood at 92 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990, plummeted to 33 by 2010. Doctors or skilled health workers are now present during almost all births.			Sri Lanka�s HIV infection levels have remained unchanged, even though the number of cases is slowly increasing. Meanwhile, in a major public health triumph, the country has all but eradicated malaria: there have been no indigenous malaria cases since November 2012, and no malaria-related deaths since 2007.			More Lankans now have access to safe drinking water (up from 68% in 1990 to almost 90% in 2012-2013.)�These and other social development outcomes are the result of progressive policies that have been sustained for decades.��Sri Lanka�s long history of investment in health, education and poverty alleviation programmes has been translated into robust performance against the MDGs, and Sri Lanka has many lessons to share,� said Sri Lanka�s UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, Subinay Nandy, at the report�s launch in March 2015.�Mind the Gaps!Despite these results, many gaps and challenges remain that need closer attention and action in the coming years.�One key concern is how some impressive national level statistics can eclipse disparities at provincial and district levels. The MDG data analysis clearly shows that all parts of Sri Lanka have not progressed equally well.For example, while most districts have already cut income poverty rates in half, there are some exceptions. These include eight districts in the Northern and Eastern provinces, for which reliable data are not available to compare with earlier years, and the Monaragala District in Uva �Province � where poverty has, in fact, increased in the past few years.Likewise, many human development indicators are lower in the plantation estate sector, where 4.4% of the population live. An example: while at least 90% of people in urban and rural areas can access safe drinking water, the rate in the estate sector is 46.3%.Another major concern: the gap between rich and poor remains despite economic growth. �Income inequality has not changed, although many poor people managed to move out of poverty and improve their living conditions,� the MDG Progress report says.�In Gender Equality, Sri Lanka�s performance is mixed. There is no male-female disparity in education, and in fact, there are more literate women in the 15 to 24 age than men. But �these achievements have not helped in increasing the share of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector,� notes the report.�Disappointingly, women�s political participation is also very low. The last Parliament had 13 women members out of 225. That was 5.8% compared to the South Asian rate of 17.8% and global rate of 21.1%. The report has urged for �measures to encourage a substantial increase in the number of women in political offices�.Of course, MDGs and human development are not just a numbers game. While measurable progress is important, quality matters too.�The MDG report highlights the urgent need to improve the quality and relevance of our public education. Among the policy measures needed are: increasing opportunities for tertiary education, bridging the gap between education and employment, and reducing the skills mismatch in the labour market.On the health front, too, there is unfinished � and never ending -- business. Surveillance for infectious diseases cannot be relaxed. Even as malaria fades away, dengue has been spreading. Old diseases like tuberculosis (8,000 cases per year) stubbornly persist. A rise in non-communicable diseases � like heart attacks, stroke, cancers and asthma � poses a whole new set of public health challenges.Open DevelopmentSo the �well-performing� nation of Sri Lanka still has plenty to do. It is just as important to sustain progress already achieved.�The new and broader SDGs will provide guidance in this process, but each country must set its own priorities and have its own monitoring systems. The spread of information and communications technologies (ICTs) has created new sources of real-time data that can help keep track of progress, or lack of it, more easily and faster.Whereas MDGs covered mostly �safe� themes like poverty, primary education and child deaths, the SDGs take on topics such as governance, institutions, human rights, inequality, ageing and peace. This reflects how much international debates have changed since the late 1990s when the MDGs were developed mostly by diplomats and technocrats.�This time around, not only governments and academics but advocacy groups and activists have also been involved in hundreds of physical and virtual consultations to agree on SDGs. In total, more than seven million people have contributed their views. As the government of Sri Lanka pursues the SDGs that it has just committed to in New York, we the people expect a similar consultative process.�Goodbye, closed development.

South Asia �at front lines� of mounting climate costs,"2015-09-23 18:30:00							0						 				2007","By Amantha PereraSouth Asian economies stand to lose around 1.3 percent of their collective annual GDP by 2050 even if global temperature increases are kept to 2 degrees Celsius, experts and public officials warn.In the second half of the century, the losses are likely to increase to around 2.5 percent of GDP, warns an analysis by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).But if temperature increases are allowed to increase above 2 degrees Celsius, losses will mount to 1.8 percent of GDP by 2050 and a staggering 8.8 percent by 2100, according to the analysis.�South Asia is at the frontlines of climate change,� said Preety Bindari, the bank�s director for climate change and disaster risk management. �The numbers and the frequency of extreme weather events faced by the region are rising.�The ADB estimates that South Asia needs around $73 billion annually from now till 2100 to adapt to negative impacts of climate change if current temperature trends continue. Those would see world temperature rise by at least 3.5 to 4 degrees Celsius by the turn of the century, scientists say.But if countries succeed in keeping temperature rise below 2.5 degrees Celsius, that cost would fall to around $40.6 billion annually, the bank said.Public officials in South Asia say that they are aware of the risk, but adaptation measures are slow as policy-makers grapple with balancing economic growth with climate resilience.�We know the numbers are dramatic and that we have a lot of work in our hands,� Kamal Uddin Ahmed, secretary of the Bangladesh Ministry of Forest and Environment said.But �right now the priority is to provide food for 160 million (in Bangladesh),� he said. �We have to make sure we get our climate policies right while not slowing down growth.�Moving to actionL. Chandrapala, director of Bangladesh�s national meteorological department, said that while changing rain patterns and rising temperature levels were now evident, what was needed was broad policy changes that take these into account.�We know what happening and have a fair knowledge of why it is happening. The next step is to make sure we are prepared,� he said.That is a view shared by ADB�s Bandari. �There are many priorities for these countries. In such a complex scenario it would be vital that they integrate climate considerations into their development goals,� she said.Because developing nations are loath to sacrifice growth to building climate resilience, she and other experts advocate that countries look at making their development plans climate friendly rather than trying to create climate resilience through separate efforts.Mohamed Abdul Qayyum, secretary of the Bangladesh Department of Disaster Management, said South Asia needed an attitude shift as well.�In South Asia we are still in the reactive mood to climate change. We need to change that to proactive,� he said.Even as policy makers and governments begin making the slow shift to climate friendly development goals, financial losses are mounting.Risks in BangladeshIf global emissions continue on their current trend, Bangladesh is likely to face an annual economic loss from climate risks of about 2 percent by 2050, according to the bank report. That is expected to balloon to 8.8 percent by 2100.Annual rice production could fall by 23 percent by 2080 in a country where agriculture employs half of the labour force of around 60 million.Dhaka could see 14 percent of its territory underwater in case of a one-metre (more than 3 feet) sea level rise while South Eastern Khulnaregion and the delicate eco-system of the coastal Sundarbans could fare far worse, the report said.Bangladesh�s other South Asian neighbours also face mounting risks, according to ADB assessments.Nepal could lose as much as 10 percent of GDP by 2100 due to melting glaciers and other climate extremes, while in neighbouring India crop yields could decline 14.5 percent by 2050, the bank said.India�s 8,000 kilometre-long (5,000-mile) coastline also faces serious economic risk due to rising sea level, it said. Currently 85 percent of the country�s agriculture requires some level of irrigation, and that need is likely to rise with temperature increases, even as India�s groundwater threatens to run short.Sri Lanka has already seen its rice and other harvests fluctuate in recent years due to changing monsoon patterns. ADB data warns that yields in the vital tea sector could halve by 2080.The island could also see a sharp rise in vector-borne diseases, with 350,000 people contracting such diseases by 2090 and 2,000 dying of them each year, the ADB analysis said.Since 2007, Sri Lanka has seen a sharp rise in dengue cases, especially in the post-monsoon months. The first nine months of this year recorded 20,058 cases; last year, a peak year for dengue, saw close to 29,000 cases over the same period, according to Health Ministrydata.There is also fear that the country may be heading into a drought - the second in two years - in the last quarter of 2015.(Thomson Reuters Foundation)",dengue

Is the water we drink safe?,"2015-09-21 18:38:59							0						 				1868","Study reveals Kelani water contaminated�with toxic chemicals��	�The Kelani River, a 145-km-long and ranked as the fourth longest river in the country. From its root in the Sri Pada Mountain Range it flows through Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, Kegalle, Gampaha and reaches Colombo. The Kelani River is the main source of supply of drinking water for Colombo, and now it is considered the most polluted river in Sri Lanka due to the rapid growth of industries located in close proximity to it. The industries located in the Biyagama Industrial Zone are blamed for the pollution since they conveniently discharge their wastewater and other effluent substances into the Kelani River.As specified in the National Environmental Act, it is compulsory to obtain an Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) to discharge wastewater into the environment from an industry. It is also reported that most of the companies in the Biyagama Industrial Zone have already obtained the EPL. The legal policy planning authorities might suppose that the companies are following the specified provisions.But, there is no regular monitoring mechanism to evaluate whether the companies meet the criteria in disposing waste into the river.The public �raised concerns about the cleanliness of drinking water sourced from the Kelani River after the suspension of water supply in several parts of Colombo District due to dispensing its water laced with oil and reports cited toxic chemical and arsenic had been found through a study conducted by the Centre for Environmental and Nature Studies (CENS). Amid all the political and regional issues, serious environmental crisis is in our hands. The situation is so serious that the bad impacts on the millions of people who consume this water are massive. This must be treated as a national crisis, and tangible and immediate action should be taken to save millions of human lives.��										�We could find high levels of arsenic - nearly 0.004 kg / m3 (4.00 milligrams) per litre - in several areas in the Kelani River�								Ravindra Kariyawasam								An environmentalist and a researcher of the Centre for Environmental and Nature Studies (CENS) told Dailymirror that testing of water samples taken from several locations of the Kelani River has established that the river has been contaminated with arsenic which could cause kidney diseases on the long-run.								�We started this research in 2013 to find out the water pollution in the Kelani River. We checked 36 parameters of the chosen areas. We checked for heavy metals in the chemical compound of the water. And then we could find high levels of arsenic - nearly 0.004 kg / m3 (4.00 milligrams) per litre - in several areas in the Kelani River. This was caused due to the release of chemicals and effluent substances by over 150 industries located in the Biyagama Industrial Zone. It takes about 20 years for even an atom of arsenic to get decomposed and the duration for the decomposition of nearly 0.004 kg / m3 arsenic found in Kelani River waters would run into decades. The authorities must take necessary action to boost up the purification process,� he said. �This is an ongoing research. The full report of the findings of their studies will be handed over to the Environment Ministry and President Maithripala Sirisena with the completion of the studies in December 2016. We are responsible for what we claim. We are a registered, non-profitable institution run by private funds of the contributors. The studies are being conducted by several qualified persons including Prof. Rajesh Goyel from Desh Bhagat University in India, Prof. D.F.Gerewal from India, German Scientist Freeza Michelle and Italian Scientist Ayarin Giagomppi,� he added.				�			�										�Our officers have the records of water sample tests carried out during the past 15 years�								�NWSDB												After the CENS�s findings, it became a hot topic among the public. Meanwhile, the NWSDB is the main authority which purifies and cleanses water for the public and monitors the contaminated content in the river before consumption. It denied the reports about the contamination of Kelani River with arsenic.								NWSDB General Manager Ranjith Balasooriya said that the NWSDB did not find �arsenic or any other toxic chemical over the limit specified by experts. �Water from this river is treated at the Ambatale and Biyagama water treatment plants before being dispensed to consumers in Colombo and its suburbs. Water samples taken from the Kelani River were tested for arsenic every week at the laboratories in these two plants for 15 years. Our officers have the records of water sample tests carried out during the past 15 years. But none of the reports had found the permissible amount of arsenic in drinking water had been exceeded in the river. �Water treatment is carried out according to the required specification determined by Sri Lanka Standards 614-2013, and that the treatment plants in Ambatale and Biyagama had at all times complied with international standards -- ISO 9001-2008,� he had further added.			�															�The tests revealed that there was no arsenic or any heavy metal in the water�									Dr. Sanjaya Ratnayake - CEA					�													When inquired about the claims, the CEA also denied it following the same method used by the NWSDB. Due to the social discussion which suspected the quality of drinking water supplied from the Kelani River, the CEA took immediate action to defend themselves by requesting the public not to panic while assuring that the water had no toxic chemicals that were likely to harm the human body.					�The quality of water was tested by the CEA and the NWSDB using samples of water taken from the Kelani River on the day the alleged contamination was reported by consumers. The tests revealed that there was no arsenic or any heavy metal in the water,� CEA Deputy Director General Dr. Sanjaya Ratnayake said.										He said the CEA had monitored some industries located within the Biyagama Industrial Zone which was reported to have released effluent substances and chemicals into the river.										�Our officials visited the industries and instructed them on their waste management systems. The industries would be constantly observed by us,� he said. Meanwhile, he had also instructed those living on the banks of the Kelani River not to dispose of any waste material.										The �could speak to some of the residents who are living near the banks of the Kelani River in the neighbourhood of the Biyagama Industrial Zone to get their thoughts and views regarding the claims.						�										�I have many doubts of their so-called studies and their results�				-Jagath Gunewardana				�								A well-known Environmentalist commenting on the studies conducted by CENS said he suspected the standard and credibility of the studies and its findings.								�These are just speculations of some organizations. Why should we believe their claims? We have responsible and reliable governmental organizations to monitor the quality of our water supply. Our people do not need to panic. National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) is conducting tests everyday by taking samples from the Kelani River, and as far as I am concerned, no heavy metal was found to have contaminated the water that was being supplied to Colombo and its suburbs. I have many doubts of their so-called studies and their results. What I have to say is, don�t get panicked after hearing their statements.�			�															Residents� claims																When we spoke to them, we found that several inconveniences they faced due to the course of action by the companies in the Biyagama Industrial Zone that eventually left the villagers� day to day lives in a nightmare.								The residents in Pahala Biyagama area drink and use well-borne water for their day to day needs. They were critical of a famous beer manufacturing industry that had dug a huge well in Biyagama in order to obtain water for their beverage manufacturing needs. The residents claimed that all the water fountains in the area have been absorbed by that huge well and consequently the old wells belonging to the residents had dried.�								The residents said that all the 150 companies located in the Biyagama Industrial Zone disposed garbage and other effluent substances into the river as a habit. They said that there were several places where empty bottles were heaped in the premises of some companies turning the atmosphere into a potential mosquito breeding ground. Notably, the Biyagama area has been reported with a considerable number of Dengue patients. Residents also said that though the Public Health Officers visited them time to time, the companies did not seem to have halted this practice.								M.G. Nandasena, a resident near the Kelani River had filed a petition with the support of several other villagers in the Western Provincial Council�s Public Petitions Committee regarding the difficulties they were being faced with.�								�I was struggling against this crisis since 2000. But, the authorities turn a blind eye to this matter. After the petition, a placement test was ordered by the Biyagama Provincial Council Chairman.								Building our hopes, the officials had visited the companies. But, as we were aware, they had allegedly been given some financial gratifications by the management of high profit yielding companies in order to hide the truth. Nevertheless, I did not give up. I complained to the CEA. I regret to say that they did not take any decision against the wrongdoers after having even visited those places,� he said.				He requested the present Government authorities to pay thorough attention into this matter and resolve it.�								�We have solutions. The Government should deploy a representative each in these companies so that he/she could observe daily garbage disposal and process. This can still be addressed. But, the authorities do not take legal action. We all would fall sick as time went on. As we know our law enforcement is inactive until human lives would be dragged into danger. We beg them. Please do something to ensure the safety of our lives without considering temporary political advantages,� he said.								�We don� know how to recognize heavy metals such as arsenic in the drinking water. But, we are certain that every negative result is due to the carelessness of the administration of the companies,� he said.								Another female resident who lives in Pahala Biyagama said that previously they could obtain water by digging the earth 10 feet below. After that beer manufacturing company�s huge well was dug, they could not get water even at 30 feet below.�								�They need water for their beverage manufacturing. As far as we know, one million bottles of beer are manufactured daily, and therefore, we don�t have water to drink. Now, we have to pay and get water. No one is there for us,e specially the politicians who visit us only during the election period,� she lamented. �There had been several instances when the authorities had visited the companies as a result of our complaints. But, we came to know that the companies� management had tempted them with bribes and kept their mouths shut,� she claimed.								Another resident told us that some of the residents who lived in the vicinity of the factories had struck some deals with the company authorities.�The companies keep asking us to come forward if we were keen to sell our plots of land because they needed more space to expand their business activities. Many of the villagers had agreed to it, since they were given large sums of money, much more than their real value. Now those who sold their lands cannot utter a word against the �procedures of those companies,� he said.								Special thanks to Telshan Network (pvt) Ltd (TNL) and Dhananjaya Narambedda",dengue

In the past four years, Sunshine Healthcare has sponsored 1,085 cataract surgeries in total.�Contributing further towards national objectives, Sunshine Healthcare donated �Mospel� Mosquito Repellent to support the government�s dengue preventive effort.Sunshine Healthcare also continued its mission of providing quality medicinal supplies and nutritional and medical supplements for those unable to afford them, by donating nutritional supplements intended for 5,500 people to the Cancer Hospital, elders� homes, children�s homes, up-country estates and a number of base hospitals. In addition, the company also supported 3,500 individuals through health camps conducted in areas particularly in which health standards were lacking.Also recognising the importance of the achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the estate sector, Sunshine Holdings� plantation sector subsidiary, Watawala Plantations, further strengthened its efforts to enhance the living conditions of its associates and the community residing in estates managed by the company. Watawala Plantations improved housing facilities and other amenities in estates, assisted physically-challenged individuals residing in estates and also focused substantially on supporting the educational aspirations of children of the company�s associates.Buoyed by the success of its Vocational Training Centre for the physically challenged in the Kenilworth Estate established in 1998, which won an Asian CSR Leadership award and was recognized among the country�s best CSR projects, another Vocational Training Centre was launched in Lindula for the benefit of 86 adults and children by Watawala Plantations in March 2015. Continuous efforts by Watawala Plantations in its estates have yielded substantial improvements in healthcare indicators (institutional births, maternal deaths, malnutrition rate) as well as educational indicators (primary school attendance, etc.) over the years among members of its estate community.�The Sunshine Holdings group and group companies also contributed to many other initiatives particularly in healthcare and education. Sunshine Holdings donated many equipment, including an Electrocardiograph to the Lindula Hospital while Watawala Tea, another group company, continued a unique initiative to celebrate and foster student/teacher relations � �Watawala Guru Upahara�.��To make a lasting impact through its community endeavours, Sunshine Holdings has continuously focused on long-term initiatives aligned with national objectives, as the positive synergy from the collective efforts of all those supporting these programmes can lead to better and more sustainable results,� Sunshine Holdings PLC Group Managing Director Vish Govindasamy said.�",dengue
Travel and Tourism Competitive Report and Index 2015,"2015-08-21 07:20:25							0						 				2848","The World Economic Forum has for the past decade carried out some in-depth analysis of the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness (TTC) of economies around the world, and published a comprehensive useful report every two years.�This report provides very useful information, which should be used by the travel and tourism industry in a strategic manner to ensure proper development. This year�s report gives some interesting information, which I have collated and presented here.�The analysis covers 141 countries around the world, and uses extensive research and data gathered from a wide range of reliable sources. The overall index is computed from various sub categories, such as Business Environment, Safety and Security, Health and Hygiene, Human Resources and Labour Market, ICT Readiness, Price Competitiveness, Environment Sustainability, Natural Resources etc.�World Rankings and Top 10The top 10 �tourism ready� economies are (as expected) highly developed countries, including Spain, France, Germany, UK, and Australia etc. The full top 10 rankings are given below.�In the Middle East, the UAE leads the list (as one would expect) with a global rank of 24 followed by Qatar.�In the Asia Pacific region, Australia leads with a global ranking of 7, followed by Japan and Singapore. Interestingly, India does not feature in the top 10, although Malaysia and Thailand are in the Top 10.�Sri Lanka�s rankingIn 2015, Sri Lanka is ranked 63 from a total of 141 countries, scoring an overall 3.80.At first glance, this seems rather disappointing, since one would have expect Sri Lanka to be amongst the higher rankings.Of course, one could immediately start arguing about the reliability of such rankings (as has been the practice lately by the previous Government, whenever Sri Lanka scored poorly in such financial international rankings). �However, one must be objective and study the trends and analysis behind such research and use this information in an objective and strategic manner to make course corrections and improvements.�In this context, firstly Sri Lanka has improved its overall ranking from rank 73 in 2013 to rank no. 63 in 2015. Hence the first positive aspect is that there has been some improvement, although we would certainly have liked to see something better.�Sustainability�In the list of top 10 countries, which best protect their natural environment, interestingly there is not one single Asian country. Switzerland leads with other Nordic countries.�This indicates that Asian countries do not pay adequate emphasis on environment and sustainability.Sri Lanka and Its Competitor SetComparison with a select competitor in the set in the region reveals that, Sri Lanka is ranked 5th with Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and India being ranked higher. �The only disappointing note here would be that India has surpassed Sri Lanka in the competitor set. Further analysis, reveals that India leads Sri Lanka in all the sub categories, except in the areas of Price Competitiveness, Air Transport Infrastructure and Natural Resources (Hotel rates in India is known to be high).�As expected, countries like Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar and Bangladesh are all ranked well below Sri Lanka.�Detailed Performance Overview of Sri Lanka � Specific CategoriesSri Lanka is ranked a low 70 in the overall Enabling Environment. Further analysis of the sub-indices indicate that it is the Health and Hygiene, HR and Labour Market, and ICT Readiness aspects that are dragging the overall index down.�The Business Environment, Safety and Security aspects are relatively acceptable ranking around 50. It is interesting to note that the Safety and Security aspect is high, which probably is due to the direct result of the cessation of hostility in the post war arena.�However, one would have expected, Sri Lanka to score much higher in the ICT Readiness aspect, since it is a known fact that Sri Lanka is relatively advanced in its IT.�The indices measured for ICT readiness including number of internet, broadband, mobile telephone and mobile broadband subscribers, mobile network coverage, quality of electricity supply etc, all of which should be good in Sri Lanka�s case. Therefore, the only conclusion would be that there may be some inadequacy in the reporting structure, where these aspects are internationally collated. Also the real use of IT directly in the TT industry could be wanting. This needs investigation.�The overall TT Policy and Enabling Conditions are ranked at 65, but again there are some surprises in the ranking of the sub categories. One would expect Sri Lanka to score high on Environmental Sustainability,but it is ranked at very low 103, while Price Competitiveness is also poor at 68. However, the focus givenon to Prioritization of Travel and Tourism is ranked high at 30.�Here again possibly inadequate publicity and positioning of Sri Lanka tourism industry, �as being quite an environmentally focused country, may not be properly reflected in the measurement criteria being applied.Overall Infrastructure ranks at 64, with only the sub index of Ground and Port Infrastructure recording a high of 41. It is a known fact that general tourism infrastructure has to be developed considerably in Sri Lanka, with some cultural tourism sites not even having basic toilet facilities.�Although beingranked 50 in the overall Natural and Cultural Resources is good, one would have expected Sri Lanka to rank higher than this. Analysis of the sub-indices indicates that it is the area of Cultural Resources and Business Travel, which is dragging the overall rank down to 69, while Natural resources on its own, is ranked at a high of 35. �This means, that perhaps we are not adequately marketing and publicizing our cultural aspects, and also that there are inadequate inputs to facilitate business travel as well.�What does this mean for Sri Lanka travel and tourism industry?�			Certainly there has been a slight improvement in the overall ranking from 73 in 2013 to �63 this year.�			The development of HR Resources (rank 86) certainly needs vast improvement, and this is an accepted fact in the Sri Lanka tourism industry.�			Health and Hygiene (rank 71) should be improved in the next few years with proper reporting structure and with some of the diseases like Malaria being eradicated. However, prevalence to Dengue may be a factor pulling the index down.�			Serious investigation needs to be done as to why Sri Lanka scores so poorly in rank 92 for ICT Readiness (perhaps the ICT industry should also get involved).�			Sri Lanka should have scored much higher in the Environmental Sustainability �area. (currently ranked 103) Considerable work has been done at operational level on the environment and energy conservation areas, but inadequate publicity and marketing of the destination as environmentally responsible one, could be the reason for the low rank.			Price Competitiveness is also close to a low rank of 70 and there has been much debate about this aspect, where many feel that Sri Lanka is no longer a value for money destination in the region. �Some proper positioning of the overall product should be decided on.�			Tourist Service Infrastructure (rank 74) has to improve vastly and this is an area that has been discussed considerably, where even basic toilet facilities are not available to tourists, visiting cultural sites.�			Sri Lanka is certainly blessed with considerable cultural resources, but the poor ranking of close to 70 could indicate that it is not been properly marketed and publicized.�			The overall infrastructure required for business travel is also inadequate and has to be improved.�ConclusionIn conclusion, it is quite evident that much needs to be done to improve such global rankings in the future years. Such indices are important to really track progress in the international arena.Those at operation level do know that considerable initiatives in most of these areas are being taken by individual organizations and other agencies.�What seems to be lacking is the need for some overarching goal or target to be established, and be pursued at a national level, in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.�(Srilal Miththapala, an electrical engineer by profession, is a senior personality in the country�s tourism industry and is a former President Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka�(THASL).

Thus, once �Clean Zones� are established in the vicinity of all Softlogic Finance branches and pawning centres spread across the island, with each contributing to improving the cleanliness of 2km, in total a 100km roadside extent would be made cleaner.�Softlogic Finance staff members were also mobilized in numbers to educate area residents in the vicinity of the Nawala Branch on the importance of segregating recyclable and non-recyclable garbage and proper waste disposal, including through the distribution of informative leaflets. While enlisting the support of area residents through means such as providing stickers certifying them to be members of Softlogic Finance�s �Clean Zone,� to inculcate the habit of garbage segregation, the company has also placed separate bins in front of the branch to dispose plastic, bottles and non-recyclable waste. ��As a parliamentarian from the area, I appreciate Softlogic Finance PLC going beyond pursuit of profit, to genuinely assist the people in the vicinity,� Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said. �This is a commendable effort and I wish the company the best of luck in this endeavour.� � ��Eventually, with the public being educated on the importance of garbage segregation and a large roadside extent of the country being made much cleaner by this programme, this programme would assume national significance,� Softlogic Finance PLC Deputy Chairman, Harris Premaratne said. �Bringing together many stakeholders, by enlisting public cooperation and the support of municipal authorities, whose assistance we appreciate, this would also substantially improve awareness.��I appreciate the initiative taken by Softlogic Finance to assist in the cleaning of the area, as the first step,� Nawala resident, Softlogic Finance PLC customer and former Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Chairman, G.

Lack of proper waste removal has also been linked to many other diseases, as well as water, soil and air pollution, while recycling is now accepted as a solution to conserve valuable and scarce resources.",dengue

CMC and Mobitel launch �Mo-Buzz Dengue� app,"2015-03-11 04:27:17							0						 				2755","The Colombo Municipal Council�s Public Health Department, along with Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel, the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU) and the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) launched the �Mo-Buzz Dengue� App recently to enable the general public to contribute towards the fight against dengue in Colombo.�Dengue has severely affected Sri Lanka in the past two decades. In 2014 the country reported nearly 40,000 dengue cases, a level of burden that has been consistent over the past few years. Developed by NTU�s researchers at the Centre of Social Media Innovations for Communities (COSMIC), Mo-Buzz Dengue will help to crowd-source dengue surveillance and provide education about dengue at the same time.�Effectively, the general public can now use the Android-based Mo-Buzz Dengue application to send a complaint about mosquito breeding sites with the click of a button. This can be done by taking and sending a picture of the breeding site using the application, which is automatically geo-tagged, thereby informing the CMC about the exact location of concern. Based on the geo-coordinates of the citizen inputs, the complaint will be routed to the public health inspector (PHI) responsible for the respective ward. The PHI will investigate the complaint and take necessary actions after which the citizen complainant�s record will be updated. Along with this function users can also learn more about dengue prevention through an educational module, learn about dengue danger zones within the CMC jurisdiction on a map, and directly call the nearest Medical Officer of Health (MOH) if needed.��Our receptivity assessment with the general public in Colombo revealed an urgent demand for approaches where the general public can constantly engage with the public health authorities�, said NTU�s Associate Professor May O. Lwin, the Principal Investigator for the study. �Participatory approaches using social media are addressing public health problems around the world, and we are excited to be among the first to use it for the betterment of public health in Sri Lanka. We believe the nature of the dengue problem lends itself naturally to a social media solution,� she said.�The University of Colombo, School of Computing (UCSC) assisted with the development and maintenance of this system, and will contribute local technological intelligence to future versions of the system. �We all know that the field of computer science is getting increasingly inter-disciplinary and this project is a perfect exemplar for how computer science is being applied for a very real, and a very threatening health problem�, said Professor Gihan Wikramanayake, Director of the UCSC.�Dengue is one of Colombo�s, and indeed, Sri Lanka�s gravest public health concerns. This technology creates a dynamic communication channel between the CMC and the general public and will bolster the effectiveness and efficiency of our surveillance efforts. If this system performs well, as we think it will, I am even supportive of expanding it to other public health problems such as food hygiene and safety,� said Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni, Chief Medical Officer, CMC. Meanwhile Mobitel�s Senior General Manager � Marketing, Nalin Perera commented, �We believe it will undoubtedly make a significant impact on the fight against dengue and would promote further awareness among people, which is an absolute necessity. As a responsible corporate citizen Mobitel has continuously been a staunch supporter of such initiatives as expressed in our motto, �We Care. Always.� and we will continue to extend our hand for this initiative in future.�Mo-Buzz Dengue is launched on the back of Mo-Buzz PHI, an earlier version that was created solely for use by PHIs for dengue surveillance efforts. The new system is geared towards the general public and is among one of the few pioneering efforts globally to integrate the power of crowdsourced health surveillance, dynamic disease mapping, and mobile-based health education on a single platform.",dengue

"Underdevelopment, Poverty and  Public Health","2014-10-13 08:53:29							0						 				145","The spread of the deadly Ebola virus in three West African countries, namely, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea has created a public health crisis in these countries and the virus threatens to spread not just to neighbouring counties in the region but to the rest of the world as well.		This prospect has naturally alarmed the leaders of the developed countries, global institutions like the World Health Organisation and others, compelling them to plan and execute a concerted global response to contain the spread of the disease. At the root of the crisis is the poor state of the economies of the countries that have been directly affected, coupled with their rudimentary healthcare services and the ineffective social infrastructure. Many commentators have compared the Ebola crisis to the HIV/AIDS epidemic that posed a major threat to public health several decades back. Since some the countries affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic then were rich and powerful with the resources and the institutions needed to stem the tide, i.e. the US and Europe, a multi-pronged response involving public education, development of drugs and treatment methods, etc. were mounted to contain the epidemic. Yet, many African countries continue to severely suffer from HIV/AIDS to this day despite significant external interventions, largely due to the poor socio-economic and political conditions prevailing in some of these countries.		The Ebola epidemic however is different. It is highly contagious and has affected several of the poorest African countries that do not have the capacity to mount an effective, coordinated response to contain the epidemic. It is this situation that has demanded a global response which the developed countries led by the US, global health institutions and civil society organisations are desperately trying to put together.		As is widely recognised, Ebola is a potential threat to global public health. This is understandable given the fact that population mobility is a major aspect of globalisation that most countries around the world have become part of. So, it would not allow global leaders and others concerned to remain complacent and do nothing. We can rest assured that everything will be done to prevent the spread of the virus to the rest of the world, though many more lives are more than likely to be lost in the affected part of the world.		On the other hand, there are many potential threats to people�s health in different parts of the world but they do not generate the same kind of interest outside the localities, regions and countries that are affected by this localised threat to public health. Yet, a close examination would reveal that their impact is not less devastating for the individuals and population groups directly affected by them. Death is death, no matter whether it is caused by Ebola or Dengue.		The threats to public health vary widely depending on their nature and the specific causes that are too numerous to even identify, let alone to provide an analysis. But, what is perhaps common to all these is that they are mostly preventable. While some of these threats are structurally rooted, i.e. socio-economic, environmental, cultural, etc., others are the result of irrational or unsound public policies, pursued at national and global level by governments and global institutions. Space does not permit a detailed discussion of even a few of such threats to public health ,so what is attempted in the remainder of this article is to indicate the kind of threats that persist or have emerged in recent years in many parts of the world and point out that the WHO�s global strategy around the Determinants of Health provides a sound perspective for countries to adopt as a way of responding to persisting and emerging threats to public health.		As mentioned before, threats to public health emanate from diverse sources. Some of these are connected to public policies that governments and other entities pursue. When we look at public health issues connected with the environment, agriculture, transport, employment, food consumption, settlement planning, etc., it becomes quite clear that many public health issues are caused by public policy failures. Today, Beijing in China is known around the world as much for the blanket of smog that envelopes it from time to time as for its impressive built environment. The rapidly rising population there coupled with equally rapidly rising fleets of motor vehicles provides the background to the worsening environmental pollution there that poses a grave threat to the health of the city population. This is not confined to Beijing alone and can be observed across the developing world.		The increasing density of population in the cities of the developing world with no corresponding efforts on the part of governments and private capital to address the issues of housing and social infrastructure has created ideal conditions for the spread of diseases like Dengue as is clearly evident in the metropolitan areas in some of the Asian countries like Sri Lanka. Official records show that there were over 32,000 cases of Dengue in urban areas of Sri Lanka last year, in particular, Colombo, where nearly a third of the country�s population is concentrated today. Our leaders boast about how beautiful the local cities and towns have become but one only has to walk through the narrow lanes in congested urban settlements to realize how badly neglected� the inner city areas can be. Moreover, due to the labour crisis in the country, many neighbourhoods are overgrown with weeds, providing enough breeding grounds for parasites. One only has to travel in a badly neglected train to realize that it is with difficulty that trains squeeze through weeds that often cover either side of the railway track in many places along the way.		The lack of sound human resource development and employment policies in many countries has persuaded many people to look for employment outside� their own countries leading to mass migration of labour. This has also become a threat to public health as migrant workers become carriers of communicable diseases. Though migration of people cannot be arbitrarily curtailed, migration should not become a way of life for a large part of the population due to unsound public policies.		As is well known, careless use of toxic agro-chemicals in agriculture has posed a grave threat to human health not just in countries where such practices prevail as food produced using such methods is consumed by a wider population. Contamination of the food chain and waterways continue to pose serious public health risks in many countries including Sri Lanka.		Moreover, the spread of unhealthy food habits, often propagated by big multinationals, has become a public health menace not just in developing countries but in the most developed parts of the world as well, i.e. America, Europe, Australasia and elsewhere.		Recognizing the wider background to growing public health risks in different parts of the world, the WHO commissioned and published� several years ago a well-articulated report on Social Determinants of Health (SDH) . The argument there in a nutshell was that many diseases are caused by factors connected with the wider social, economic, political and cultural environment and, therefore, the interventions should address the issues of the wider environment as well. In other words, the emphasis should be at least as much on public health interventions as on curative care, which has taken precedence over the former in many parts of world including our own country. It might be useful to find out where we stand today with regard to this important global initiative on the part of the WHO.		Over to the health authorities.",dengue

So, it would not allow global leaders and others concerned to remain complacent and do nothing. We can rest assured that everything will be done to prevent the spread of the virus to the rest of the world, though many more lives are more than likely to be lost in the affected part of the world.On the other hand, there are many potential threats to people�s health in different parts of the world but they do not generate the same kind of interest outside the localities, regions and countries that are affected by this localised threat to public health. Yet, a close examination would reveal that their impact is not less devastating for the individuals and population groups directly affected by them. Death is death, no matter whether it is caused by Ebola or Dengue.The threats to public health vary widely depending on their nature and the specific causes that are too numerous to even identify, let alone to provide an analysis. But, what is perhaps common to all these is that they are mostly preventable. While some of these threats are structurally rooted, i.e. socio-economic, environmental, cultural, etc., others are the result of irrational or unsound public policies, pursued at national and global level by governments and global institutions. Space does not permit a detailed discussion of even a few of such threats to public health ,so what is attempted in the remainder of this article is to indicate the kind of threats that persist or have emerged in recent years in many parts of the world and point out that the WHO�s global strategy around the Determinants of Health provides a sound perspective for countries to adopt as a way of responding to persisting and emerging threats to public health.As mentioned before, threats to public health emanate from diverse sources. Some of these are connected to public policies that governments and other entities pursue. When we look at public health issues connected with the environment, agriculture, transport, employment, food consumption, settlement planning, etc., it becomes quite clear that many public health issues are caused by public policy failures. Today, Beijing in China is known around the world as much for the blanket of smog that envelopes it from time to time as for its impressive built environment. The rapidly rising population there coupled with equally rapidly rising fleets of motor vehicles provides the background to the worsening environmental pollution there that poses a grave threat to the health of the city population. This is not confined to Beijing alone and can be observed across the developing world.The increasing density of population in the cities of the developing world with no corresponding efforts on the part of governments and private capital to address the issues of housing and social infrastructure has created ideal conditions for the spread of diseases like Dengue as is clearly evident in the metropolitan areas in some of the Asian countries like Sri Lanka. Official records show that there were over 32,000 cases of Dengue in urban areas of Sri Lanka last year, in particular, Colombo, where nearly a third of the country�s population is concentrated today. Our leaders boast about how beautiful the local cities and towns have become but one only has to walk through the narrow lanes in congested urban settlements to realize how badly neglected� the inner city areas can be. Moreover, due to the labour crisis in the country, many neighbourhoods are overgrown with weeds, providing enough breeding grounds for parasites. One only has to travel in a badly neglected train to realize that it is with difficulty that trains squeeze through weeds that often cover either side of the railway track in many places along the way.The lack of sound human resource development and employment policies in many countries has persuaded many people to look for employment outside� their own countries leading to mass migration of labour. This has also become a threat to public health as migrant workers become carriers of communicable diseases. Though migration of people cannot be arbitrarily curtailed, migration should not become a way of life for a large part of the population due to unsound public policies.As is well known, careless use of toxic agro-chemicals in agriculture has posed a grave threat to human health not just in countries where such practices prevail as food produced using such methods is consumed by a wider population. Contamination of the food chain and waterways continue to pose serious public health risks in many countries including Sri Lanka.Moreover, the spread of unhealthy food habits, often propagated by big multinationals, has become a public health menace not just in developing countries but in the most developed parts of the world as well, i.e. America, Europe, Australasia and elsewhere.Recognizing the wider background to growing public health risks in different parts of the world, the WHO commissioned and published� several years ago a well-articulated report on Social Determinants of Health (SDH) . The argument there in a nutshell was that many diseases are caused by factors connected with the wider social, economic, political and cultural environment and, therefore, the interventions should address the issues of the wider environment as well. In other words, the emphasis should be at least as much on public health interventions as on curative care, which has taken precedence over the former in many parts of world including our own country. It might be useful to find out where we stand today with regard to this important global initiative on the part of the WHO.Over to the health authorities.",dengue
The Dilemma of a Minister,"2014-08-01 20:52:16							0						 				1393","By Duncan Fernando :		The draft regulations of the proposed National Drugs, Cosmetics and Devices Authority Act� is nothing but a joke. It is the same� Dracula� presented� with more teeth in a different cloak to benefit the mafia. This is not what the public anticipated	The Minister of Health has gone on record as saying that the ``Health Ministry is surrounded by four types of racketeers. They are multinational milk powder companies, multinational drug companies, multinational cigarette and alcohol companies and corrupt officials bribed by those multinational companies. The ministry can face this challenge successfully only if all support it - especially the media.�� According to Minister Sirisena, the ministry is engaged in a significant amount of work to protect the public from those four racketeers. CDN - 12.08.13Corrupt officials in the ministry are an unfortunate legacy inherited by the ministry.� Solving the problem of corruption is vested in state apparatuses.� The Ministry of Health is no exception when it comes to corruption. The appointment of a Secretary from the SLAS recently confirms the first line of treatment to this scourge. A structural change in the Ministry is an imperative to eliminate corruption.The most controversial issue today with the Ministry of Health is not preventive and curative care but procurement of supplies and implementation of regulatory functions. Human Resource conflicts at various levels in the organisation add to the woes. Both are incurable ailments that have drawn the attention of the general public. A country that controlled malaria, filaria, cholera, smallpox and other tropical diseases is today struggling to control Dengue as the medical administrators are grappling with other issues.� Most recently,� on July 30, the public were able to witness how doctors behaved in trying to� solve one of their issuesPrivate sector, hospitals are managed by shareholders. medical professionals are engaged mainly in curative services for which they are compensated. Medical administrators do not manage the shareholders.Implementing the Drug Act & Food Act in 1980 under Ministry of Health led to the development of `Obesity` among Health Administrators.� Non communicable diseases such as diabetes, Ischemic heart disease, hypertension and cancer are on the increase, creating a huge market� for healthcare� needs.� We face the controversy of CKDU which is costing the government millions. Under proper preventive care an effective awareness campaign would arrest this trend and save billions in foreign exchange.The drug utilization process should be vested under an `independent authority` outside the purview of the Ministry of Health to sort out the existing mess and to evolve a drug delivery system to meet national needs.In 1972, on the recommendations of the Bibile/Wickremasinghe report, the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) was incorporated by an Act of Parliament.�� It functioned under the Ministry of Industries and Scientific Affairs. It� serviced� national� needs by providing essential drugs at affordable prices. This culture changed in the early eighties with the open economy.Today the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation under the Ministry of Health, is marketing a brand of paracetamol imported from India through pharmacies @ Rs. 1.00 per tablet. A tablet of this drug can be easily sold at 50 cents for the benefit of the consumer. This inflated price defeats the very objectives of the SPC. The infection of corruption that prevails has developed into chronic levels.The draft regulations of the proposed National Drugs, Cosmetics and Devices Authority Act� is nothing but a joke. It is the same� Dracula� presented� with more teeth in a different cloak to benefit the mafia. This is not what the public anticipated. It is what the mafia has manipulated. Prof Lal Jayakody, a recognized academic had recently focused on where the devil is.We have several Medical Faculties and a Post Graduate Institute of Medicine. These bodies train medical professionals.� Pharmacologists play a key role in inculcating the ethics of `drug usage in clinical practice` to budding professionals. Their expert� advice� is crucial in devising a National Drugs Policy. The Pharmacists are there to manage logistics till a patient receives a drug. They are professionals in this field. Sri Lanka Pharmaceutical Society is a professional body. Their views must also be taken into account.According to the WHO, the process of ``drug utilization`` is defined as, `` marketing, distribution, prescription and use of drugs in a society with special emphasis on the resulting medical, social and economic consequencesThe people are baffled as to why the Medical Administrators cannot implement regulations that are in effect now. For example CDDA Gazette No 722/2 dated 06.07.1992 contains regulations which are suppressed to the detriment of the people. It had been swept under the carpet for a long time. The Minister may not be aware of this.An Independent Drugs Authority at National level is an imperative to oversee the movement of Chemical and Biochemical substances that are used in medicine, agriculture and industries. These substances bear an end result in humans. The famous Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of USA is a forerunner. It imposes stringent controls on usage of these substances. Under these circumstances the proposed Cosmetics, Devises and Drugs Authority Act should be reviewed or made redundant.Under a restructured ministry, only the task of healthcare that is preventive and curative should be devolved to the Healthcare system. Even the Medical Research Institute should be made an autonomous body. At present the Universities provide doctors and other professionals to man healthcare services. Similarly, other institutions can provide� services such as drugs, devices, fixtures, fittings, furniture and buildings to provide healthcare. For any shortcomings, the doctors can aim their guns towards these supply services. This is one way of breaking the nexus of corruption in the Ministry.The Ministry of Health should deliver a National Healthcare Policy including all currently available healthcare facilities in our country, such as allopathic medicine, indigenous medicine - ayurvedha, homeopathy, unani, sidha and holistic medicine. Healthcare covers all these disciplines. �In many developed countries including USA, Germany, Japan, etc.. research and development is based on this foundation. Our Ministry is dominated by stooges of western medical culture backed by MNCs. They deprive the country of utilizing natural resources for the benefit of mankind. On the other hand they engage in bio-piracy to do research on our naturally occurring substances.If the proposed National Drugs, Cosmetics and Devices Authority becomes statute under the Director General of Health Services, it will destroy our entire heritage.The debate on this issue is not complete if the pharma-industry,� a major stakeholder is not drawn in. They are primarily profit driven.� R & D is secondary.�Internationally it is a well known fact� that� pharma-industry is highly profitable and is growing at a tremendous� rate.� When bribery and corruption is discussed,� the giver plays a superior role to procure business. That is (unethical) business.� The bribe component is built in the end user price.� Imports have to be over invoiced to include the bribe component. This practice is rampant in growing markets. The latest is the multimillion dollar corruption scandal by GSK in China.The subject of advertising and� brand promotion direct to medical profession is a thing of the past. In a country where IT and communication facilities are advanced, any medical professional can access information on the internet or contact a peer for advice over the phone. Besides they have their continuous medical education programmes conducted by relevant specialist associations.The mechanism of price regulation adopted by Consumer Affairs Authority has no positive impact on consumers. The CIF prices can be manipulated to maximize profits.� In the alternative, if Import Duty is enhanced the tendency would be for under invoicing. It will have a direct bearing on price, leading to a level playing ground. It will also generate income to state coffers.Corruption is an integral component of a free market economy. When corruption is an endemic infection at national level, not confined to the ministry of Health alone, finding a remedy is beyond imagination. Therefore to eliminate corruption in the Ministry of Health is indeed a dilemma for the Minister. However, he would be able to minimise corruption to a great� extent if he can resort to a structural change in the ministry as suggested earlier, leaving health professionals to take care of only preventive and curative� functions. The nation as a whole will support this move.",dengue
Dengue Epidemic : Causes and Consequences,"2014-07-13 21:00:23							1						 				1395","The government epidemiology unit reports that the dengue cases have already exceeded the 20,000 mark in the first six months of 2014. If the trend continues in the next few months, it can exceed the 2009 figure of 32, 7000. Nearly 60% of all cases are reported from the western province, while the other high concentrations are in larger urban centres in other parts of the country like Ratnapura, Kurunegala, Kandy, Batticaloa, Jaffna and Galle.The above figures show that Dengue is very much an urban phenomenon, associated with high population and residential density and poor environmental management. The Western province today has nearly one third of the country�s population. This is not surprising because the province also accounts for over 50% of the country�s wealth. People naturally flock to this region because wealth is concentrated here.It is true that the incidence of dengue follows the pattern of annual rainfall. The epidemic usually coincides with the rainy season. On the other hand, if we blindly follow this logic, we should simply expect a dengue epidemic to follow the rainy season, a natural course of events! But, a dengue epidemic is a serious matter and cannot be simply treated as a mere natural phenomenon. It costs human lives. It puts enormous pressure on health institutions. It poses a grave threat to the lives of thousands of people. It disrupts the social and economic life of families affected by the disease, etc. So, not many people want to accept it in a fatalistic manner.The above situation naturally compels us to explore ways and means of arresting the worsening trend. How can we prevent periodic dengue epidemics? In order to find an answer to this question, we should look at the statistics more closely, in terms of their historical trends and spatial patterns. As I already mentioned, statistics closely correspond to the trend in internal population mobility in the country over time. Moreover, there is a clear correlation between population density and the incidence of dengue.But, the factors that create conditions conducive for the spread of the disease are not obvious and need to be identified in order to find a way to respond to the epidemic. The present tendency on the part of the authorities to simply blame the people for the spread of the disease prevents us from identifying underlying factors that are actually at the root of the epidemic. This does not mean that we should not take measures to educate and encourage citizens to be civic minded and environmentally conscious.As mentioned earlier, the extremely high concentration of population in and around Colombo has resulted in a built environment and settlement pattern that are highly conducive for the spread of dengue. Increasing demand for land in the Colombo metropolitan region has led to an unprecedented rise in land values which are beyond the means of a large majority of people.This has also led to land fragmentation and the spread of low income disadvantaged settlements everywhere. Buildings have come up everywhere, often obstructing public infrastructures like canals, open spaces, access roads, railway lines, etc.�Most of the people who have migrated to the western province from other parts of the country in recent years are low income persons and families in search of livelihoods.They mostly engage in informal sector activities like three wheeler driving, pavement hawking, construction work, personal services, private security and retail trade. Given the fact that there is no major publicly or privately funded low income housing programme in the country, most of these people live in low income settlements which are characterized by extreme congestion, the lack of open space, poor and irregular constructions, inadequate facilities for drainage and waste disposal, etc.Given the low and irregular incomes of the vast majority of people living in the Colombo metropolitan region and other urban centres across the country, one cannot expect a different pattern of human settlement. In more developed Asian countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan, the situation is different largely because more carefully planned low income housing has prevented the kind of haphazard development that has taken place in this country.Another major issue that has a bearing on the spread of dengue is the poor physical infrastructure in low income areas.Proper storm water management is a near impossibility in urban areas due to poorly constructed and poorly maintained minor roads, canals and drains. This is the general picture that one finds in almost all urban areas, not just in the Colombo metropolitan region. After each spell of rain, water gets collected in pot holes, dilapidated drains and unevenly paved footpaths in almost all urban neighbourhoods.Local authorities are incapable of doing much to address these issues. In the case of local authorities, the priorities are different; they want to build supermarkets, office buildings, etc., to collect revenue rather than develop and implement systems for the proper management of the built environment. As is well known, the local councils receive only a small fraction of the state revenue. This is grossly inadequate to meet the cost of a much needed environmental improvement programme within their jurisdictions.Given the above state of affairs, it is unrealistic to expect a significant change in the incidence of dengue in the near future, unless a major programme of integrated environmental management is introduced in order to revamp low income settlements and streamline storm-water management in the Colombo metropolitan region and beyond. Whether the necessary resources could be mobilized to do so is a question that only the relevant authorities can answer. Meanwhile, the authorities will continue to blame the people for the worsening dengue epidemic in the country, for not doing enough in their neighbourhoods to prevent the spread of the disease that many of them suffer from. On the other hand, the cost of the epidemic is mounting, not just for the victims but for the entire country. While the quality of life of the people living in affected areas is significantly undermined by the threat of dengue, those who are infected and their families are naturally traumatized by the life threatening nature of the illness. Moreover, the epidemic is not good advertising for the tourist industry as some may think twice before travelling to the country in the mildest of an epidemic.",dengue
Ban on NGOs a chilling blow to civil society: Karu,"2014-07-10 00:03:54							1						 				2261","Banning Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) from holding press conferences workshops and issuing media releases was a chilling blow to civil society and the freedom of assembly and free expression in Sri Lanka, United National Party (UNP) Leadership Council Chairman Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday.		Striking a severe blow to civil society and the freedom of assembly and free expression in Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Defence has issued a circular to Non Governmental Organisations virtually banning them from expressing their views to the public,� Mr. Jayasuriya said a statement yesterday. He said a circular had been sent to over 1000 NGOs byh the National NGO Secretariat, which strangely functions under the Ministry of Defence, banning the organisations from holding press conferences, workshops and even issuing a simple media release.		The statement by Mr. Jayasuriya read as follows :	Under the Sri Lankan Constitution, any citizen, irrespective of whether they belong to an association or not, were guaranteed the right of free expression. They are guaranteed the right to peaceful assembly. The Ministry of Defence that has stamped out civil liberties in unprecedented ways in the post-war era, is well on the way to creating a military state in Sri Lanka. It is in such an autocratic set up that the Defence establishment dictates the limits of an individual or collective right to speech and assembly. It is the Rajapaksa Government's greatest ruse, to keep telling the public and the world that Sri Lanka is a functioning democracy, while the Defence Ministry runs a parallel administration that is adamant to curb freedoms and build surveillance systems to oppress the citizenry and stamp out dissent against the regime.		It is the argument of the Defence Ministry, completely unsupported in the law books of this country, that these activities would be tantamount to NGOs going beyond their mandate.		Even if the Defence Ministry was basing its proscription in law, it would be laughable in its hypocrisy. Sri Lanka's Ministry of Defence is one of the most versatile in the world, engaging in activities beyond its mandate in ways that are mind-boggling. It is involved in such fields as horticulture, tourism, aviation, dengue prevention to name a few. It operates boat rides and barber shops. It has become the place to resolve every national issue, from economic crises to religious conflict, because the citizenry is increasingly aware that it is in that building that the true power of this regime resides. The civil administration is losing its grip as the military facet of the regime gains in strength, stature and brutality with each passing day.		The circular clipping the wings of NGOs in the country therefore, is about a much bigger issue.		The time has come for Sri Lankans to question why the Defence Ministry's shadow intrudes into every aspect of civilian life and governance in this country. As citizens, we must question why we are forced to rely on the military to perform the most perfunctory of tasks, such as collect our garbage or cut our grass. We must open our eyes as to which branch of this Government is creating the perception that it is the military establishment that is the only functioning system - and why it is necessary to entrench that impression in the minds of the public.		As the country's main opposition we demand that the Government recognises and upholds civil society and its contribution to the broader democratic framework that it claims to be commitment to. The Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa demonises every individual and institution that stands in its way to consolidate power and establish an autocracy. The NGO sector has long been in its cross-hairs.		The UNP demands that the Government and the Ministry of Defence relinquishes its stranglehold on civil society. As Chair of the Commonwealth, which only months ago hosted the Commonwealth Peoples' Forum and recognised the role of civil society in a democracy, the Government has a moral obligation to keep its hands off peoples movements and NGOs.",dengue
Anti Dengue campaign: go to the gutters  - EDITORIAL,"2014-07-04 04:01:36							0						 				1899","With another dengue epidemic raging and this year�s number of victims being the highest ever, the Government needs to act immediately on some practical and concrete proposals made by a leading chartered architect and town planner to curb the dengue menace where the victims are mainly children.The chartered architect Elmo J. De Silva points out that one of the favourite areas for dengue mosquitoes to breed are roof gutters. He says roof gutters need to be cleaned and maintained regularly but this is not often possible due to the height of the building and the inaccessibility of the roof gutters. The dengue mosquito breeds in clean water. Due to the inaccessibility of the roofs, the gutters are rarely cleaned and may not be checked by officials who visit houses regularly during apparently unsuccessful dengue prevention weeks.Traditional Sri Lankan architecture had no roof gutters, but had projecting gable ends and wide roof eaves and therefore this was not an area of concern. However most buildings recently designed have gutters which have become fertile grounds for dengue mosquitoes to breed.Some years ago Sri Lanka imported large stocks of BTI bacteria from Cuba with high hopes of eradicating the dengue epidemic as Cuba has done. But it did not work obviously because Sri Lanka did not take another step that Cuba did�the banning of gutters. The dengue task force officials have asked residents to clean the gutters regularly but residents say it is not possible to find labourers to do this regularly and it is dangerous for residents to try to do this. It is also risky to climb onto the roofs of many storied, old or dilapidated buildings.According to the chartered architect, during a recent visit to Singapore he noted that buildings are designed without gutters. In 2005, a circular banning roof gutters was sent to the authorities and architectural firms by the National Environmental Agency of Singapore. In Thailand also, roof gutters are banned.He says he noted that architects have successfully taken up the task of designing buildings without gutters. Furthermore, many buildings in Singapore have won international awards and recognition while rain water disposal has been successfully tackled. Architects in Singapore have obeyed this decision as their civic and social responsibility. He says architects in Sri Lanka also need to do this and be patriotic in a time of crisis.The architect says Sri Lanka�s powerful Urban Development Authority�headed by Defence Secertary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and playing a major role in modern development--should implement a law banning gutters. The law should insist that when state or private institutions and house builders apply for permits they should be issued only if there are no gutters. The architects must be asked to use creative methods of disposing rain water, instead of gutters.Going from top to bottom, another major problem in dengue prevention or eradication is the clogging of public drains in many parts of the city, suburbs and even in villages. Drains are clogged for various reasons, one main reason being the irresponsible disposal of �sili sili bags� which are not bio degradable and block the drains for years. Dengue mosquitoes breed in these drains also.Many residents say that when they complain to their local councils they are told to go to the Road Development Authority (RDA) which in turn send them elsewhere till they end up in the drain or the dengue ward. �Such irresponsibility must be stopped and it would be necessary for the UDA to act effectively in such cases also.",dengue
Mathews gives England a run for their money,"2014-06-25 20:27:26							0						 				2269","ri Lankans, bruised after weeks of battling rampant floods, a raging dengue epidemic and religious tensions will this week unite in celebrating the sport which often brings them together, after the national cricketers won their first ever series victory in England in a nail-biting thriller on Tuesday.And leading them was their captain Angelo Mathews. Mathews, fresh after a sterling performance at the previous Test at Lords�, surpassed even those high standards, scoring 160 runs that and taking four wickets. As a result Sri Lanka, initially struggling to force a draw, went on to record a famous win.Sixteen months into his job as Sri Lanka�s test cricket captain - and the thirteenth to take that job - Mathews has now achieved what even the great Arjuna Ranatunga could not do: win a test series against England, in England, a rare achievement for teams touring the land where the game was born.Mathews though has been in the spotlight during the England tour not only for his performances. His decision to endorse the controversial dismissal of Joss Butler at the non-striker�s end during the one-day series meant that the English cricket authorities and the media always had the knives out for him.Twenty seven year old Angelo Mathews began his cricketing career at St. Josephs College, Colombo a school which also produced Sri Lanka�s best paceman Chaminda Vaas. Thisara Perera, another exciting prospect for Sri Lanka was a team mate of Mathews at school.He excelled in school cricket and captained the Sri Lanka Under-19 cricket team at the Under-19 cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka seven years ago. That was to be his stepping stone to break in to the national cricket team.His international debut was against Zimbabwe two years later when Sri Lanka toured that country.� Against a weak opposition, Mathews had a modest tour and at that stage his place in the team was by no means guaranteed, with many others vying for national honours.Mathews however grabbed world attention during the World Twenty20 tournament in 2009 when he made a spectacular save near the boundary by catching the ball, throwing it back into play as he was going over the boundary line and then returning to retrieve it. He was hailed as a �thinking� cricketer.A string of consistent performances followed, especially in the one-day format of the game that showcased Mathews� talents as a right-handed batsman and a medium-pace bowler.Mathews gradually sealed his place in the one-day team as its all-rounder.Perhaps a reason for investing in Mathews with the captaincy is his temperament. Many a time, he has shown that he can be unruffled in the face of rising tensions on the cricket field and play his normal game, often guiding other players with a degree of maturity that belies his age.A case in point was the one-day international against Australia in Melbourne in November 2010. Australia had posted a decent 239 for 8 and chasing this target Sri Lanka�s frontline batsman had given up the ghost when Mathews was joined by Lasith Malinga with the score at 107 for 8.Mathews played the stellar role, scoring an unbeaten 77 in a partnership that took Sri Lanka to an improbable victory and set up a world record for the highest ever partnership for the ninth wicket. It was a defining moment in Mathews� career and one that again earmarked his leadership potential.By the end of 2011, when the hierarchy of the Sri Lanka cricket team was in disarray with Kumar Sangakkara�s resignation as captain and Tillekeratne Dilshan being appointed to the captaincy only to resign a few months later, Mathews was the automatic choice as vice-captain.Mahela Jayewardena accepted the captaincy again in 2012 and Mathews retained this position. He was being groomed for the captaincy and confirmation came when he was appointed skipper of the Twenty20 team, in the aftermath of the loss of the final in Colombo and Jayewardena�s resignation.Mathews� elevation to the captaincy of the test and one-day international formats in February 2013 therefore came as no surprise. However, Mathews has had to pay a price: the captaincy of the Twenty20 format had been handed over first to Dinesh Chandimal and now to Lasith Malinga.While Mathews may have the temperament to lead the country, he is yet to reach great heights as a player. He has played only forty test matches, has only four centuries against his name in test cricket and is yet to score a one-day international hundred, his highest score being an unbeaten eighty.However, the recent tour to England enabled him to display his potential as a player. His performances in the One Day Internationals and tests earned the plaudits of English critics as well who hailed his calm temperament and his cricketing acumen as a captain.Unlike some of his predecessors, Mathews� performances as a captain have been much more impressive then when he was a mere player in the team. He has also successfully handled three former captains in the team: Mahela Jayewardena, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillekeratne Dilshan.Mathews� diplomatic skills will however be put to the test as he will have to bear the pressures that come with the captain�s job not only on the field, but off it as well. His employer, Sri Lanka Cricket has a dubious record in this regard with that institution itself involved in constant controversy.	Mathews has now achieved what even the great Arjuna Ranatunga could not do: win a test series against England, in England, a rare achievement for teams touring the land where the game was bornAfter his stellar performances in England and after scaling such great heights so early in his tenure as captain, Mathews may find the burden of expectation hard to handle. Thus far though he seems to take the pressures of captaincy in his stride.If Angelo Mathews can get his act right, he has a good ten years of captaincy ahead of him.� However, he must also know that the life of recent Sri Lankan cricket captains, are like the bouncers he faces on the field: nasty, brutish and short.",dengue
FOOD AND DRINK AND EARLY GRAVES,"2014-06-24 04:29:59							0						 				1310","eople are at cross-roads wondering what to eat and what not to eat. And no wonder; although the choice is vast, eating and drinking these days has been recognised as a hazardous human need. Although somewhat late in the day, this situation spurred the media to launch a hefty rocket campaign at many types of vegetables grown in the country recently. Simultaneously, it targeted hoarders of onions, potatoes and dry fish among other consumer commodities, and questioned the cleanliness and hygiene of restaurants, the food they serve, the quality of water etc. exposing lots of dirty laundry in the food and drink arena in the country. The shocking dirt that was dug up confirmed that multiple layers of �food and drink wool� had been plastered over public eyes from the year dot duping people into early graves.Stuff people eatPeople never gave a second thought to the �wholesome, nourishing, safe to eat� fresh vegetables, meats and meat preparations, milk, fish�fresh and dried�prepared food� western, Indian, Chinese, Malay, other cross- bred stuff and the poor man�s sixty- bucks buth� packets on sale to feed the hungry. They also thought that drinking �spring� water (that actually came direct from Water Board pipes) bottled and sold in convenient plastic bottles was the best way to avoid typhoid and kidney disease. Naturally they assumed that the ISO certification guaranteeing germ free and muck free bottled water was safe as houses to drink. Pollution of drinking water has become as common as virus infections. Recently there were instances of industrial waste polluting drinking water in wells. So the truth, in food and drink, as the media pointed out, was stranger and more �ughy� and �eeky� than fiction.�All are in the same boatThe problem of selecting safe-to-eat food and drink had trickled down to the home of Shelton Perera, owner of the Wallside Restaurant and Bar. One morning Shelton asked his better half Joy pottering around the pantry, �What are we to eat, Darlo?� In his forties, tubby Shelton found with an elevated blood pressure, cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes had been prescribed an assortment of pills, advised to exercise regularly and follow a �sensible� diet. �Imagine me exercising at this age? And where�s the blessed time? No thank you, I�ll manage with the tablets and er� diet� was Sheltons response to Joy�s endeavours in pushing hubby out of the house�to walk. �If people in good health wouldn�t know what to eat without committing long-term suicide, what do sick people eat,� asked the restaurant proprietor.�Don�t be so pessimistic Shelley.��Darlo, haven�t you realised we are breathing poisonous air, eating contaminated or adulterated food and drinking water unsafe to drink? We are killing ourselves, knowingly. Today, more people die of cancer, heart ailments, diabetes, kidney disease, virus fevers and God knows what else. See, Uncle Bertie, our old school Principal Mr Hagalla and old William; they died of cancer.� I hear that Mr Dinapala (a neighbour) is having a dodgy kidney. His days are numbered, I hear. In addition to dengue, I hear of people dying of illnesses doctors fail to diagnose. It�s all due to pollution and the poisons we consume. �	The truth, in food and drink, is stranger and more �ughy� and �eeky� than fictionSelf-poisoning scenesJoy said, �It�s a problem all right. Take our staple�rice� goviyas apply gallons of weedicides and insecticides on paddy from nursery stage to harvesting stage. So the rice we eat is festooned with chemicals that don�t do us any good. If goviyas don�t spray, battalions of pests will feast on paddy while viruses do the rest. Result, no rice for us and goviyas would be left high and dry. But spraying will save them from poverty and committing suicide and we will have rice to eat; even contaminated rice.��How about wheat flour products, then? You know bread, seeni bunis, malu pan, godas, roti and so on?��Same story except that wheat fields are sprayed and dusted from the air.Shelley, like it or not, we are in a diet soup. I planned to give you boiled vegetables and chicken for dinner, now I am worried ...goviyas� spray carrots, beans, cabbage, tomatoes, beet, potatoes etc with double doses of this and that to kill bugs that destroy veggies grown at great expense and toil. They also spray stuff to force ripen bananas and mangoes to meet market demands. They are all supposed to be poisonous. I hear imported grapes and apples get similar treatment before being packed off here. It�s not only in agriculture and farming; tea gets sprayed with all kinds of stuff to control virus diseases and bugs, caterpillars and mites. I am also thinking of avoiding chicken that are full of prophylactic drugs, antibiotics and growth hormones to rush them to tablesꔓNo wonder docs advise pregnant mothers not to eat chicken,� interrupted Shelton.� I am sure the chicken style is followed in pig farms. Perhaps it�s safe with beef, but then we don�t eat beef. We drink imported milk though, but we hear of dubious stuff sprayed on grass and milk production boosted through hormones given to cows in milk producing countries. Additions to milk powder to make them more drinker- friendly are also considered as culprits in making you sick.��We are at the butt end of tricksters making money at our expense, Darlo. Hey, what about fish? They say Omega-3 small fish reduces cholesterol and is good for the ticker.��I heard that too,� said Joy. �But they say that sea water is contaminated through rivers carrying chemicals used in agriculture and industries. They end up getting deposited in the bodies of fish. Adding to these poisons fishermen and fish traders add formalin to keep fish from rotting. Apparently they use the same stuff to make dry fish. So eating fish is asking for trouble as well.� ��Eating out and other nightmares�Hell,� exclaimed Shelton. �So eating veggies, fruits, chicken, fish, drinking milk and even water will kill all of us eventually. If so, what�s the point in cooking and eating at home? Might as well eat out.��That�s silly,� said Joy. �Eating joints serve the same poisons. And speaking in terms of hygiene and cleanliness almost all eating joints are guilty many times over. They are also notorious for using adulterated ingredients, prohibited colours and flavours and serving date-expired foods that send customers to hospitals.��Huh, talking of hospitals and medicines; recently some pharmacies and big importers of medicines were caught giving new stretches of shelf life to date-expired medicines. Those fellows were not concerned that sick people would become victims of such dirty shots. According to the pharmaceutical grape vine, one particular culprit had been caught with his pants down earlier as well. But he had got off just like that.��That�s not surprising. They must be having powerful friends who can wave magic wands to get rid of irritations. The point is we can�t breathe, eat, drink� or take medicines without wondering �am I digging my own grave?���Too Late�Hey, Tommo, did you hear all that?� Ooty an owl and Tommo, a pussycat in the employ of Shelton Perera as vermin controllers at Wallside, had been all ears to their mistress and mistresses� distressing conversation.�Meeoowwyep (yep). I don�t want to be in their shoes at any cost. Our governors� government may have messed up in food and drink, but as a pussy and an owl, we have access to fresh, nutritious food, don�t we? And, we need not keep flavouring our governors� leftovers. If what they eat is not good for them, it can�t be good for us either, noooo?��Whooom, whooom, so what can our governors do?� ��Very little, I am afraid,� purred pussy.� �Don�t you know our governors� governments are classic examples of �I also ran�; not even a measly bronze in the heats. Overall no government has shone in the affairs of our governors.� That includes not dying in the common business of filling bellies. So take it from me, the food and drink issue has come to stay. Judging by the form in the country, it�s not surprising of course.�",dengue
Ethno-religious violence and its consequences,"2014-06-22 18:30:05							0						 				1515","It was only a few weeks ago that I wrote an article in this column pointing out that there was a likelihood of ethno-religious violence breaking out around certain flash points in the country.I pointed out there that ethno-religious violence does not flare up without an environment conducive for it. It appears that those who participated in the violent acts are largely disgruntled youth with a sense of relative deprivation who have been mobilised by militant religious groups.They would not have taken part in the violence without a prior psychological conditioning for such behaviour.	Persisting uncertainty and the increasing sense of insecurity can encourage more and more people to look for opportunities to leave the country. Apart from the few illegal migrants, most of those who usually leave are those who are most needed in this country. They are the people with intellectual and financial capital who are in demand everywhere.There are certain pre-conditions for an inter-group conflict to emerge.Firstly, at least one of the groups should feel that the other is a threat or unduly privileged. Secondly, there should be considerable social distance between the two groups in terms of place of work, residential pattern, community organisation and social practices.In other words, the two groups do not necessarily share much in common in their day to day lives.And finally, their almost exclusive identities should not only be continually reproduced through education and other social practices but also reinforced by political mobilisation, either formally or informally. The recent incidents of inter-group violence figured prominently in both the electronic and print media.These media reports became the subject matter for discussion in the media as well as in informal settings like work places and residential neighbourhoods.In other words, their social and psychological impact has been felt across the country. The messages that have been circulating across the wider public have not been uniform.One strong and widespread voice that we hear is that the country can ill-afford another round of ethnic-violence. But, then there are also mixed feelings among some people regarding the events.We are living at a time when a large majority of people have come under increasing economic and social pressure. Increasing cost of living and the burden of widespread ailments such as dengue, chronic kidney diseases and cancer have already devastated many families in almost all parts of the country. A majority of people are running around to make a living and attending to various social responsibilities. Most children and youth are on the move, attending school and private classes, looking for work, etc. Any sense of insecurity arising out of widespread violence can be the last thing that most families would want to face. Such an eventuality would be akin to the proverbial �falling from the frying pan to the fire�.I have argued in this column that there is an urgent need to restructure the country�s economy away from mono-crop agriculture and services in favour of more value added industries and diversified agriculture.	What we witness today is an increasing emphasis on tourism, gambling and other services. These latter areas of economic activity are naturally more sensitive to the prevailing tense atmosphere in the country. Already, one country has reportedly issued a travel advisory and others are likely to follow. If the trend continues, the tourist industry is likely to be badly affected, sending shock waves through financial institutions in the country as well. Moreover, prospective investors are likely to think twice before investing capital in this country.Yet, what we witness today is an increasing emphasis on tourism, gambling and other services.

They are the people with intellectual and financial capital who are in demand everywhere.Sri Lanka has been already very badly affected by the exodus of tens of thousands of people with qualifications and skills in diverse fields. This is already a major factor impeding the country�s development. Can we afford to see more such people leaving the country? Do we need any more reasons to adopt a policy that rejects violence as a means of resolving disputes at a community level?A sense of security is a fundamental requirement for� a contended life. A sense of insecurity created by actual or potential violence is thus a major issue that needs to be effectively resolved by the State.That is also the minimum that any modern state owes to its citizens. While law enforcement authorities have the immediate responsibility to restore public order, it is sound State policies that can bring about lasting inter-community reconciliation. Such policies should be based on evidence generated by objective investigations of ground realities in different parts of the country.We should not have the illusion that this is merely a local affair confined to one or two villages in the south.In fact, latent ethnic tensions are widespread in the country, particularly in urban areas where competition for space and economic opportunities is intense. Extremist elements are more than capable of whipping up ethno-nationalist sentiments in these areas leading to physical violence.Inter-community tension does not always lead to physical violence. The risk of reprisal attacks often prevents even ideologically motivated groups from harming their perceived rival groups. On the other hand, large-scale mobilisation of people by organised groups can tip the balance, as it happened in the south.So, the absence of violence should not make the authorities complacent.All necessary measures need to be taken to defuse tension and bring about sustainable reconciliation between communities. This requires more than a mobilisation of security forces to protect the communities by simply holding back rival groups.",dengue

The exemplary campaigns have proved to enhance pride in the country, strengthened unity and braved national problems with confidence. These innovative campaigns that have driven Sri Lankans into making positive changes for t he country reiterates Starcom�s philosophy, which is to make �Connections which Captivate�.The Paper Flag campaign executed by Starcom in 2012 was the first campaign in Sri Lanka to win metal at the Cannes Lions, the world�s biggest celebration of creativity in communications. The bronze award-winning idea engaged newspaper readers to celebrate Independence Day following the 30-year civil war by turning a national newspaper into a national flag. By following the instructions given in the paper and building their own flag, readers had the national flag at their hands allowing them to take part in the Independence Day festivities. The campaign created a patriotic feeling amongst Sri Lankans as it engaged with people during the country�s National Day. These innovative campaigns that have driven Sri Lankans into making positive changes for the country reiterates Starcom�s philosophy, which is to make �Connections which Captivate�The 2013 Unity Paper, a game changing idea launched to make meaningful connections by strengthening national unity was launched. Starcom�s execution of the campaign was created to remind every Sri Lankan of the importance of national unity and integration after the setbacks due to the 30-year civil war. The Unity Paper is the first ever dual language newspaper used to bring together the most prominent ethnic groups of Sri Lanka.Expanding to social media, a joint alphabet was also created where letters from the Sinhala and Tamil alphabet were interlocked representing the same letter, further demonstrating the unity between two groups. The paper won awards at the prestigious Cannes Lions 2013, was a finalist at Adstar 2013, won two Silvers and one Bronze at Spikes Asia 2013 and won two finalists, Gold and Lotus Root Award at Adfest 2014 and was the first Sri Lankan agency to be awarded a Merit award at One Show in 2014.The Dengue Paper initiative in 2014 was executed by Starcom in an attempt to solve the grave dengue problem Sri Lanka faced. The world�s first mosquito-repellent newspaper was published on the last day of National Dengue Week, which was also the World Health Day. The ink used to print the newspaper was specially formulated with citronella essence, a natural mosquito repellent, and thus every letter of every word stopped mosquitos from biting.Along with this, the campaign also used posters at prominent bus stops, which were also coated with Citronella essence and striking print ads where letters in the vernacular blocked the dengue mosquito.

Private investment to resolve problems of water scarcity in the world,"2014-05-07 04:25:41							0						 				3708","It is easy to take a running tap for granted, but water scarcity is a serious problem in many parts of the world. It is believed that over one billion people worldwide do not have access to clean and safe drinking water, according to a water project (http://thewater project.org/water _scarcity) and an organisation seeking to remedy this issue.The recent turmoil regarding the contamination of drinking water due to the effluents from a factory in Ratupaswela and contamination of bottled water with kerosene hit the headlines in the local print and electronic media in Sri Lanka proving that water scarcity is a growing problem locally too.Much time and effort have to be spent to decontaminate the water supply especially in most of the developing countries in Africa and Asia. Accordingly, water shortages contribute to low levels of education and economic development as people are forced to focus simply on survival. Even most troubling are the water-borne diseases that spread through unsafe drinking water. Further, in the African and Asian countries stagnant water courses lead to breeding of mosquitoes, etc. leading to vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, etc. The outbreak of dengue recently in Sri Lanka is a good example.Water scarcity has both economic and physical dimensions. From an economic perspective, water in some places is available at a cost too high for many to meet, while in other areas, clean, safe drinking water is simply not physically available.� At the current consumption rate, this situation will only get worse, states the World Wildlife Foundation: �By 2025, two�thirds of the world�s population may face water shortages and ecosystems around the world will suffer even more.�Economic impact of water scarcityAccess to water is of vital importance to economic and political security worldwide as the financial consequences of water scarcity extend far beyond communities without reliable access to drinking water. This is a growing segment of the investment world that is directing capital towards safe water infrastructure, according to the newspaper Globe and Mail. Simon Gottelier, Co-Manager of Impax Asset Management�s Water Strategy fund, predicts the sector will grow.�We see water as a long-term secular growth theme,� Gottelier told the news outlet. �There are multi-decade trends we are positioning ourselves to capitalize on.�Gottelier identifies a number of reasons for his company�s �water hypothesis�. For one, as growing populations become increasingly urban, existing water infrastructure undergoes considerable stress and must be replaced, while the developed areas often demand updated infrastructure, since many have invested very little into these systems now.Furthermore, government oversight of water quality is increasingly becoming a problem, and the necessary coping with climate change is putting an impossible strain on many developing countries. Severe weather events may damage important parts of water systems such as sewers, drainage infrastructure and water treatment plants meaning extensive replacements and repairs.Present situation in Sri LankaSri Lanka is a perfect example of water infrastructure undergoing severe stress and it is mandatory that responsible institutions get involved in replacement and repairs to the old systems with the growing population. Access to safe drinking water is also a problem in Sri Lanka. To this end, the Colombo Municipality�s proposal of imposing a sewage tax could be justified in the above context.Investing in waterFor investors interested in water, companies may be divided into three areas, namely (a) infrastructure (b) water treatment and (c) utilities. A diverse portfolio is recommended and water-related investing may pay off in the future as shortages increase and standards for best practices in this area continue to rise.�I would suggest it is extremely difficult to have a fund entirely dedicated to water,� John Gibbs, Vice President and Portfolio Manager at Dynamic Funds told The Globe and Mail. �There just aren�t enough stocks to fit this theme.�Jason Stevens, investment executive at Sprott Global Resources Investments, discussed the possible future of water with the website Investing.com and his less than optimistic opinion from a social point of view has important implications for those in a position to invest in water security.Water scarcity highlighted at Economic Forum �At the World Economic Forum on East Asia, business leaders agreed that addressing growing global concern over environmental challenges such as climate change and water was the issue with the greatest potential impact for Asia, its people and its economies.�We will be running out of water long before we run out of oil,� Peter Brabeck�Letmathe, Chairman of the Board of Nestle in Switzerland said at the conference. �One out of every five children is dying every 20 seconds because we have not been able to solve the problem of clean water today.�ConclusionsBrabeck-Letmathe�s due warning underlines the urgency of worldwide clean water shortages and as the issue becomes more serious and gain more social attention, governments will need to provide a solution to the water problem. As demand for improved access to clean drinking water grows, opportunities to invest in sound water infrastructure will only grow.Accordingly, the business community in Sri Lanka should give serious thought for investment in water and try to evaluate whether such investment could bring about a reasonable rate of return. It is also proposed that the Government of Sri Lanka may pass appropriate legislation, if not already done, so that private investors in the leisure and�� industrial sectors, especially with foreign direct investment (FDI), bear all costs of providing safe drinking water and facilities and also construct all infrastructure including sewers etc. and maintain such utilities.Ref: �Not a Drop to Drink: A Look at Water Scarcity-Resource Investing News Staff Writer April 22, 2014.�(Dulip Jayawardena, a retired Economic Affairs Officer United Nations ESCAP, can be reached at fasttrack@eol.lk)",dengue
Climate Change,"2014-05-02 18:30:15							1						 				25400","By: Rumana RazickAs we go about our day to day activities atmospheric temperatures are increasing, ice caps are melting, sea levels are increasing, heat waves and heavy rainfalls are intensifying, fish and other creatures are migrating to the poles and in some cases going extinct.Speaking to Daily Mirror the Chairman of the National Science Foundation in Sri Lanka Professor W.L. Sumathipala said in pre-industrial times the carbon dioxide concentration was 280 parts per million and at present due to industrialisation and forest clearance the carbon dioxide concentration has increased to 390 parts per million.	""Due to the prolonged drought during the last few months there has been a shortage in drinking water supplies in the north and north central province. At the moment demands are being met and there is no reason to panic""�The carbon dioxide concentration will reach 450 parts per million in no time, increasing global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius. The recent changes in temperature and rainfall in Sri Lanka tallies with the global change and these irregular weather patterns can be attributed to global warming. Sri Lanka is being affected by global warming and will gradually face the consequences,� he said.Current Situation in Sri Lanka�Change in Weather Conditions - Director General Meteorological Department L.Chandrapala and S.R. JayasekeraThere has been an increase in the atmospheric temperature and rainfall intensity since the 1960s. Most models predict that there will be a decrease in rainfall and shortage in water supplies in the long term. At present the night temperatures across the island have increased and the number of thunder days in Colombo has also increased. The intensity of cyclones in Sri Lanka is expected to increase with the increase in temperatures. In addition there is a slight decrease in the aerial annual rainfall volume and rainfall patterns have been irregular.Depleting Water Resources- Director General Mahaweli Authority Gamini RajakarunaDue to a decrease in rainfall levels all reservoirs are depleting and the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts will be most affected. Due to the prolonged drought during the last few months there has been a shortage in drinking water supplies in the north and north central provinces. At the moment demands are being met and there is no reason to panic. However if the drought continues it will be difficult to meet the demands.Power Generation � Spokesperson Ceylon Electricity Board Senajith DassanayakeWater levels have fallen by 25% due to poor rainfall in the catchment areas and there is a water shortage in the dry zone. Due to this hydro based power generation has fallen from 40 percent to approximately 14 percent. To meet the electricity demand power generation has been switched to 86 percent thermal and 0.1 percent wind. Thermal power generation will be utilized to maximum capacity. However there would be an automatic trip to non priority feeders if there is an imbalance in power generation. If the drought persists and demands cannot be met the entire country will be affected. However at the moment there is no risk of an electricity crisis.Crop Cultivation � Director General of Agriculture Department Rohan WijekoonWe usually cultivate 2.7 million metric tonnes of paddy for the Maha season which is from October to February. However this season we were able to cultivate only 2.2 million metric tonnes. In the last five years there has been a 6 percent reduction in the land area to be cultivated and an 8 percent reduction in paddy production for the Maha season. This was due to the drought. With the slight increase in rainfall we are expecting 1.12 million metric tonnes of paddy production for the Yala season and that would be sufficient till December. If the drought continues in the worst possible situation we will be able to cultivate only 0.62 million metric tonnes of paddy. This would be sufficient till October. At present there is not enough water to cultivate to the maximum capacity and farmers have been asked to cultivate crops that require less water.The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which is a scientific intergovernmental body set up under the auspices of the United Nations to assess and understand the risk of human induced climate change published its report on climate change and the associated consequences. The report stated that global warming will have the greatest impact in South Asian countries.According to experts the atmosphere is influenced by oceanic temperatures and ocean input. The atmosphere gets most of its energy from countries in the South Asian region. The South Asian region has a lot of islands that drives the changes in the atmosphere.Professor Sumathipala explained the predictions made in the report, the effect these changes will have in Sri Lanka and the measures that need to be taken to address them.PredictionWith the exponential increase in temperature sea levels will rise from 8cm to about 88cm by the end of the 21st century. Most of the countries that are tropical islands will submerge. Consequently by the end of the century low lying areas in Sri Lanka will submerge. As the sea level increases the salt water intrusion will ruin the fertile areas in the East ceasing cultivation.The southern and western regions will be submerged destroying the urban and infrastructure development. The wet zone, that is the south west side will have more rain and the dry zone that is the central and north east regions will be drier which would cease cultivation in Anuradhapura and Polonarruwa regions. Salt water entering the river beds will move upstream and accumulate in the pumping stations. This will have its toll on the drinking water supply and result in a water shortage in the long term. Flash floods and landslides will increase and cultivable paddy fields will go under water.FactorsBoth global and local factors affect the changes in weather patterns. The El Nino effect which is the increase in temperatures in the East Pacific and decrease in temperatures in the West Pacific that decreases rainfall levels in South East Asian countries is occurring more frequently. As Sri Lanka is in the South East Asian border an El Nino with a great magnitude will result in low rainfall levels and drought in Sri Lanka. The burning of fossil fuels in Sri Lanka to generate power and the clearing of forests to make way for expressways and buildings also contribute to the increase in carbon dioxide concentrations.EffectsHydro power generation will cease due to water shortages and switching to thermal power generation will increase costs. Burning of finite fossil fuels will not only aggravates global warming but will also have a negative impact on the economy. Clearing trees and constructing highways will create a heat island resulting in a rise in temperatures. There will be sudden changes in the weather pattern due to changes made in the physical topography. Vector borne diseases like dengue and malaria will increase as the insect population increases due to irregular rainfall pattern. As global temperatures increase food production will decrease and with time there will be a food shortage.MeasuresAn alternative energy resources that is sustainable needs to be used. Renewable resources like solar, wind, tidal or bio mass should be used to generate electricity as oil is finite and would not last even 40 years. Incentives or tax concession should be given to the public to encourage them to use sustainable resources for day to day activities. Technology should be improved to predict weather patterns well in advance to make preparations with regards to cultivation and power generation. Urban developments that do not intervene with nature needs to be promoted. Proper planning and analysis on environmental and climatic impact needs to be done before infrastructure and urban development.Research on different varieties of crops that is capable of adapting to change in weather patterns needs to be done.",dengue

It also reported that 708 cases of leptospirosis were detected in the island in March and another 221 in April.�Speaking about leptospirosis in Sri Lanka the Chief Epidemiologist at the Ministry of Health Dr. Paba Palihawadana said that while the number of reported cases has been decreasing the disease is still present in the Western Province, Galle, Hambantota, Ratnapura, Kegalle and paddy cultivating areas in Sri Lanka.�We have asked all farmers to take the prophylactic drug doxycycline before stepping into their paddy fields. Unfortunately many farmers have refused to take the drug putting them at risk to the disease. High fever, body aches and pains, severe headaches and reddening of the eyes are the primary symptoms of leptospirosis. If proper treatment is not taken it would lead to urine infection and depolarisation of the eyes, Dr. Palihawadana said.Rats are common carriers of the disease and farmers have been asked to keep their paddy fields clean and destroy all rat burrows. The highest number of reported cases was in 2008 when 6000 people contracted the disease.(Rumana Razick)",dengue

WHO commends Sri Lanka,"2014-04-04 04:15:29							9						 				3081","Sri Lanka has made remarkable progress in controlling malaria by bringing cases down from 203,000 in 2000 to zero locally acquired cases in November 2012, the World Health Organization said.It also said that dengue has become the world�s fastest growing vector-borne disease, with a 30-fold increase in incidence over the past 50 years.The organization is urging countries to prevent and control all vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, kala-azar, lymphatic filariasis and malaria. These diseases account for 17 per cent of the estimated global burden of all infectious diseases.The WHO made the appeal on the occasion of World Health Day, which falls on April 7.�These are deadly but preventable diseases. The solution lies in a united and sustained effort from all of us. Ministries of health alone cannot control these diseases,� said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia.Forty per cent of the global population at risk of malaria lives in the WHO South-East Asia region, home to a quarter of the world�s population. Malaria is endemic in 10 of the 11 countries of the region: Bangladesh, Bhutan, North Korea, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.Dr Poonam said Maldives is the only country in the region that has remained free of malaria since 1984, but Sri Lanka has made remarkable progress in controlling it by bringing cases down from 203,000 in 2000 to zero locally acquired cases in November 2012.She said the region recently eradicated polio, and �it is time for us to show the same resolve to defeat malaria, dengue and other vector-borne diseases.�Lymphatic filariasis, another mosquito-borne disease, is linked to poverty and causes disfigurement and social stigma.She said the region has 60 million infected people while 875 million are at risk of infection.To stop its spread, WHO has recommended an annual mass drug administration of single doses of two medicines to all people in endemic areas.�With mass drug administration, with effective coverage, there is no reason why diseases like lymphatic filariasis cannot be eliminated from the region,� said Dr Singh.

"Editorial - Now, poisonous food, tomorrow poisonous water","2014-03-01 03:03:19							0						 				1814","On Thursday President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared opened a huge overhead water tank at Kolonnawa to distribute water to the people in surrounding areas including Kolonnawa, Rajagiriya and Angoda. This tank, financed by the Asian Development Bank was built on part of the land belonging to the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) which was built by the British in the 1840s on the highest part of Colombo to minimise the spread of infectious diseases to the community.According to informed sources part of this land was acquired from the Ministry of Health by the Water Supply and Drainage Board to build the overhead tank. However, when the work was going on and ADB official on a visit to Colombo is reported to have proposed that an underground tank, also be built in the same area to distribute water to Colombo city and the suburbs.Hospital authorities and environmentalists say though they raise questions about the safety of such a underground tank, water board officials decided to go ahead with the project for reasons allegedly involving kickbacks and commissions.According to hospital authorities thousands of patients with deadly diseases like Smallpox (Vasooriya), Cholera, Yaws or an� infection of the skin, bones and joints (Parangi) had died over the years and were buried in this land. Though these diseases are no longer� a problem in Sri Lanka, the germs or viruses and bacteria which caused those diseases could remain dormant for long years in the earth. They say that even at present the IDH treats thousands of patients suffering from ailments such as typhoid, diarrhoea and dengue and their faeces with all the germs go into underground septic tanks in the hospital land.Health rights' activists and environmentalists are raising questions whether the germs in the land will gradually seep into the water and spread to the people who drink or otherwise use this water. No concrete� wall can prevent such seepage, according to experts.� Concrete has small holes called capillary pores which are 10 to 50 nanometres . So it is apparent that viruses and bacteria which are much smaller than the size of these pores can seep in to the water through the concrete wall of the underground tank. A small crack caused by the tiniest earthslip is enough to cause much bigger contamination. �Erika Henderson, director of research states in the journal'Water Efficiency' ""� contaminated groundwater can also seep into the tank. �..pathogenic microorganisms that create water-borne diseases are still sometimes found in public water systems. �These infections can spread rapidly, and sometimes even create an epidemic�.With the prolonged drought, Sri Lanka�s rivers are running low and we are looking for other sources to supply water to the people. But the project at Kolonnawa instead of building bridges over troubled waters appears to be more a case of where still waters run deep and we should look before we leap because we might end up with not only polluted food but also polluted water.",dengue

In an interview with , she revealed why she wants to get involved in politics and what she hopes to do if she gets elected.								�																																											Q:�Why did you decide to join politics suddenly?				This is not a sudden decision. I have been in every nook and corner of the city of Colombo and I have been working with MP Duminda Silva from 2004. Everything needs to happen at the correct time and I think this is my time. People need some one to vote who is accessible. So here I am.																				Q: Any particular reason for you to join politics?				As I said earlier I have been with MP Duminda Silva during his campaigns. He invited me so I also decided that it is time for me to join. Nobody speaks any good about politicians nowadays. I am not saying that everyone is bad. But there are some who are not even accessible and that people do not get an opportunity to talk or discuss their matters. I am an entertainer and they know me for years. They see me all the time. They can reach me any time.				I would say that this is an opportunity that people would not get for their lifetime. That is to elect someone who is known and knows about them well.																								Q: Do you think that you can change the image the general public has of politicians?				Yes, that will be my duty. I want to change the image the people have. People do not have to think twice in voting for me because I am well- known. Someone like me can make a change. Always being the �black sheep� in the family, I can make a change. And if I get elected I will be a �black sheep�. I will do what is there to be done immediately and will take action whenever the necessity comes.																								Q: What qualifications do you think you have to be in politics?				This was the exact question which many people asked me when I entered the music industry twelve years back. I believe it is all about making a difference. Same applies to politicians. It is what I can do for people what really matters, and make them feel that we are with them.																				Q: What are your plans for the Western Province if you get elected?				I have many plans. I would fight for the rights of the people. I would start with places and areas which have been forgotten by others. Even in Colombo, there are many things to be done. I will focus on them. I will provide service to everyone from infants to the elderly. I will take action when any urgency arises, I will not postpone things. You know I would not stay at one place. I am a working horse and I always gallop.				The most important thing is to strengthen the hand of President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his development process. He needs someone trustworthy and who is wiling to work for him as he can not check every minute detail. We should be there for him.																								Q: Many actors, actresses and other famous personalities who enter into politics tend to change their attire. Why didn�t you change yours?				A very good question. Many people asked me why I did not wear a saree on the day I went to face the Nomination Board. I am a simple person and people have seen me in this way for years. If I change my attire at once then that will be something to discuss about. I believe it is the person�s inner-self and not the outer appearance that matters.				If I wear a saree and come with my braids it will look like Bob Marley wearing an �ariya Sinhala suit�. I do not have to change. People know me well.																								Q: There seems to be a trend with many artists to enter politics. Are you also going along with this trend?				No, I do not going along with the trend. It is that I feel that this is the best time for me to come out and do a service to people. But one thing must be understood. Our neighbouring country India has produced many politicians who were former actors and actresses. For example Jayalalithaa who was an actress has become a powerful personality in Tamil Nadu. There are many others who have created some sort of difference.				Yet my appearance in politics is not because of the trend.																								Q:�Politics seems to be a goldmine to many. Is this one of the reasons for you to enter politics?				I am not a pauper. I have a decent income as an entertainer. Excessive amounts of money and power will not take you anywhere. What is necessary is to work for the people.				�																		�With my beauty,					I will fight for the country�																																							Gayesha Perera																																																																Former Miss Sri Lanka and popular model Gayesha Perera faced the Nomination Board of the SLFP recently. As an aspiring politician she shared her thoughts with� as to why she decided to enter politics.								�																															Q: Why did you decide to enter Politics?				I want to serve people. I was not born in a bed of roses. I know what people go through, their sorrow, tears.� My mother had to struggle with poverty in bringing me up. As a person who can hear their heart beat I thought I should work for the people.																				Q: Why do you think people must vote you?				I have represented 20 millions of people when I represented Sri Lanka at the Miss World contest. I marked Sri Lanka�s name when I won beauty pageants, especially when I won the title Miss. Personality in 2011. As a person who has taken Sri Lanka�s name to the International arena, I think I am eligible to contest.																								Q: If you get elected what are the plans you have?				I have a separate agenda. I will especially work for women�s empowerment. Many women in this country face many mishaps every day. I want to work for them. I will be focusing on three areas. One is the dengue menace. I hope to work towards dengue prevention. I will be walking from house to house.								The second area I would focus is malnourishment. Some children even in Colombo suffer from malnourishment. I would work on behalf of them.								The third area I would focus is the well-being of women. Also with the experience and the knowledge I have, I would like to help produce beauty queens for the country.																				Q: Why did you decide to contest from the UPFA? Did you get any invitations from other parties?				I received many Invitations from various parties to contest. I am a member of the UPFA from the year 2010. I have been with MP Namal Rajapakse�s youth programme and I have been a part of it. Hence I decided to contest from the UPFA. Also I appreciate and respect our President Mahinda Rajapakse and his leadership. I want to be a part of his team and be strength to him.																								Q: As you know Sri Lanka had pressure from the international community at the Human Rights Council in Geneva.� If you are elected how would� you help the government to deal with such issues?				As I said earlier I have represented twenty millions of people of this country in the beauty pageants. I have the capacity and capability to bring the message to the world. Our soldiers sacrificed their lives in bringing peace to this country. As a citizen and as a person who has represented the country it is my duty to appear on behalf Sri Lanka.								I think I am qualified to talk for my country. I will share one of my personal incidents. I was in Dehiwela town on the day there was a bomb blast in 1996. Until 2009 I had that shock in my mind that we might have to face this again.� But after 2009, we are free to travel everywhere. People are happy and they live peacefully. I will do whatever it takes to take this message to the international community.																				Q: How do you see our ties with India? Do you think there should be a change?				I think we have an excellent connection with India. Some of our actresses have made their way to Bollywood as well.� I believe our relationship with India is well balanced.																								Q: Are you positive that the UPFA will win the election and do you think you can win?				Definitely the UPFA will win and I am positive about my victory. I have done my part already and I will continue to do my part. UPFA�s victory means people�s victory.� I have a lot of people around me who support me constantly. All I want is to request the people to join with us, help me to work for you and raise my voice for you. My victory is your victory.								�																		�Being an actress					is just like being a politician�																																							Ruwanthi Mangala																																																																Popular actress Ruwanthi Mangala also wishes to throw her hat into the ring of forthcoming Provincial Council elections. She told� what motivated her to get into active politics and what her plans are for the people if she gets elected.								�																																			Q: What motivated you to get into politics?				I had always maintained an interest to engage in politics since my childhood - being strongly influenced by my father who was very politically active. The decision to enter politics at this point was mainly in response to an invitation extended to me by MP Duminda Silva. I did not wish to disappoint him by refusing his invitation.																				Q: Why did you choose to contest from the UPFA? �				I have always been a supporter of the UPFA and I wish to contest from UPFA because this government has done a lot for the betterment of the future generation.																				Q:�Why do you think people should vote for you?				I believe the public should base their decisions on the actions of each candidate. I haven�t received the nomination yet but I am confident of the fact that people would support me if I was to contest. Their immense support has been made very clear through the many phone calls I have received since my appearance before the SLFP Nominations Board earlier this week. They have assured me of their fullest support and I am confident that they will accept me as their representative. �																								Q: Do you think it�s justifiable for artistes to enter politics without a sound background or knowledge on politics or governance?				I believe artistes are the most apt individuals to be appointed as representatives of the people because we are very close to people�s hearts. Even through the various roles we portray as actors and actresses, we give life to real life characters and therefore, we have a much closer and intimate understanding about battles of people. We know of people�s expectations and the same understanding might not be in someone who is greatly educated in politics. �								Besides, being an actor is just like being a politician � we start our day at about 4 am and end it past midnight.� It�s a hectic lifestyle and requires dedicated work, and I am certain I am up for the task.																								Q: What issues do you think should be prioritized with regard to the Western Province?				I will make a decision on which issues to focus on if and when I am elected. If I am elected to the position I aim for, I will personally visit the households of all my voters and inquire their issues and what they expect of me. Through a series of discussions I will figure out which issues should be prioritized in addressing. �				Apart from that, I have plans to focus attention on equality for women and preventing violence against women. If I am elected I wish to meet the President and draw his attention on strengthening and increasing punishments given to those charged with abuse of women or children.																								Q: Despite participation, women have succeeded very little in impacting the fields of arts or politics.� What sort of a difference do you plan to make?				This is a peaceful country gearing towards prosperity. We are blessed with a good leadership and the masses, particularly the women are now living without fear. Besides being an actress, I am a wife and a mother and I have managed my household affairs perfectly. Similarly, I believe I will be able to deal with the challenges of my political career. �																								Q: Politicians at present are frequently accused of entering politics in expectation of the perks and benefits that follow if elected. Were the perks and benefits one of the factors you considered in deciding to enter politics?				Majority of the politicians have been branded as cheats and liars as a result of failing to keep the promises they made to the public prior to being elected. But I can guarantee, I will always stay true to my word; in fact, if I am elected I would give up my acting career in order to channel my full focus on serving the people.				�																		��I didn�t enter 					politics to entertain myself��																																							Malsha Kumaratunga																																																																Malsha Kumaratunga, daughter of Minister Jeevan Kumaratunga faced the SLFP Nomination Board hoping to be selected as a candidate for the forthcoming WPC elections. She explained to� why she wants to be elected to office as a provincial councilors and what she expects to do if she gets elected.								�																																							Q: What prompted your entry into politics at this point?				It was a plan on the cards. Following my graduation, I returned to Sri Lanka with expectations of laying the foundation for my political career. As an initial step, I began working as my father�s personal assistant for nearly two years and even afterwards continued to assist him because I believe in on-the-job training as it opens up chances to meet people and obtain an up-close understanding of their issues and expectations.				I also believe that this is the ideal time for my entry into politics as my intentions are genuine and I have a sound educational background that would help my interest in serving the people.																				Q: Why do you think people should vote for you?				I am not demanding anything from the people. But they need to know that their valuable vote should be cast on behalf of an educated individual with genuine intentions to make a difference; someone with a true claim to be their representative. I believe my genuine intentions will reflect upon my work and would offer an incentive for people to make a choice to vote for me.																				Q: Do you believe that being a politician�s daughter is a qualification for you to enter politics?				Even during the Nominations Board interview on Monday, it was repeatedly mentioned by the board members that my father had not even mentioned my appearance before the Board at least through a casual phone call. I wished to make an impression and make my case on my own and my father too agreed that I should convince the Board on my own, regarding my ability to contest at the upcoming provincial elections.								Being linked to a political family does have its edge, but my decision to enter politics was not a na�ve choice I made to simply keep myself occupied or to entertain myself. I am thankful for the impact that I would carry due to my familial political connections but I don�t wish for it to become my whole identity.																								Q: What issues do you believe should get priority at the WPC elections?				I am planning to carry my message to the masses based on three main points � strengthening gender equality, improving living standards and helping people achieve a life free of poverty and providing accessibility to education for every child.																				Q: Do you believe the government has followed the right course of action in responding to war crimes allegations and in dealing with the rising pressures from the international community before the upcoming UNHrc sessions, on accountability issues?				I believe the government won the war fair and square and did so in order to safeguard the citizens of this country. The defeat of the LTTE was for the greater good and I believe the government has adopted the right course of action in grappling the international pressures.																				Q: What are your comments on the participation of women in politics in Sri Lanka, in comparison to the global situation? �				I believe Sri Lanka is in a relatively better position when speaking of female participation in politics. But it can improve. Some 52% of our population is females but the political representation in comparison is disproportionate. Moreover, although certain sections of the media might attempt to portray the participation of females in politics as a battle simply among the few females, the actual competition is much more intense as at present. It is only about 15 female politicians who have been elected to local government bodies in comparison to some 300 male provincial councillors.				�",dengue

I have done my part already and I will continue to do my part. UPFA�s victory means people�s victory.I have a lot of people around me who support me constantly. All I want is to request the people to join with us, help me to work for you and raise my voice for you. My victory is your victory.													Popular actress Ruwanthi Mangala�Being an actress is just like being a politician�Popular actress Ruwanthi Mangala also wishes to throw her hat into the ring of forthcoming Provincial Council elections. She told Daily Mirror what motivated her to get into active politics and what her plans are for the people if she gets elected.Q. WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO GET INTO POLITICS?A: I had always maintained an interest to engage in politics since my childhood - being strongly influenced by my father who was very politically active. The decision to enter politics at this point was mainly in response to an invitation extended to me by MP Duminda Silva. I did not wish to disappoint him by refusing his invitation.Q. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO CONTEST FROM THE UPFA? �A: I have always been a supporter of the UPFA and I wish to contest from UPFA because this government has done a lot for the betterment of the future generation.Q. WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE FOR YOU?A: I believe the public should base their decisions on the actions of each candidate. I haven�t received the nomination yet but I am confident of the fact that people would support me if I was to contest. Their immense support has been made very clear through the many phone calls I have received since my appearance before the SLFP Nominations Board earlier this week. They have assured me of their fullest support and I am confident that they will accept me as their representative. �Q. DO YOU THINK IT�S JUSTIFIABLE FOR ARTISTES TO ENTER POLITICS WITHOUT A SOUND BACKGROUND OR KNOWLEDGE ON POLITICS OR GOVERNANCE?A: I believe artistes are the most apt individuals to be appointed as representatives of the people because we are very close to people�s hearts. Even through the various roles we portray as actors and actresses, we give life to real life characters and therefore, we have a much closer and intimate understanding about battles of people. We know of people�s expectations and the same understanding might not be in someone who is greatly educated in politics. �Besides, being an actor is just like being a politician � we start our day at about 4 am and end it past midnight.� It�s a hectic lifestyle and requires dedicated work, and I am certain I am up for the task.Q. WHAT ISSUES DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED WITH REGARD TO THE WESTERN PROVINCE?A: I will make a decision on which issues to focus on if and when I am elected. If I am elected to the position I aim for, I will personally visit the households of all my voters and inquire their issues and what they expect of me. Through a series of discussions I will figure out which issues should be prioritized in addressing. �Apart from that, I have plans to focus attention on equality for women and preventing violence against women. If I am elected I wish to meet the President and draw his attention on strengthening and increasing punishments given to those charged with abuse of women or children.�Q. DESPITE PARTICIPATION, WOMEN HAVE SUCCEEDED VERY LITTLE IN IMPACTING THE FIELDS OF ARTS OR POLITICS.� WHAT SORT OF A DIFFERENCE DO YOU PLAN TO MAKE?A: This is a peaceful country gearing towards prosperity. We are blessed with a good leadership and the masses, particularly the women are now living without fear. Besides being an actress, I am a wife and a mother and I have managed my household affairs perfectly. Similarly, I believe I will be able to deal with the challenges of my political career. �Q. POLITICIANS AT PRESENT ARE FREQUENTLY ACCUSED OF ENTERING POLITICS IN EXPECTATION OF THE PERKS AND BENEFITS THAT FOLLOW IF ELECTED. WERE THE PERKS AND BENEFITS ONE OF THE FACTORS YOU CONSIDERED IN DECIDING TO ENTER POLITICS?A: Majority of the politicians have been branded as cheats and liars as a result of failing to keep the promises they made to the public prior to being elected. But I can guarantee, I will always stay true to my word; in fact, if I am elected I would give up my acting career in order to channel my full focus on serving the people.													Malsha Kumaratunga, daughter of Minister Jeevan Kumaratunga�I did not enter politics to entertain myself�Malsha Kumaratunga, daughter of Minister Jeevan Kumaratunga faced the SLFP Nomination Board hoping to be selected as a candidate for the forthcoming WPC elections. She explained to Daily Mirror why she wants to be elected to office as a provincial councilors and what she expects to do if she gets elected.Q. WHAT PROMPTED YOUR ENTRY INTO POLITICS AT THIS POINT?A: It was a plan on the cards. Following my graduation, I returned to Sri Lanka with expectations of laying the foundation for my political career. As an initial step, I began working as my father�s personal assistant for nearly two years and even afterwards continued to assist him because I believe in on-the-job training as it opens up chances to meet people and obtain an up-close understanding of their issues and expectations.I also believe that this is the ideal time for my entry into politics as my intentions are genuine and I have a sound educational background that would help my interest in serving the people.Q. WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE FOR YOU?A: I am not demanding anything from the people. But they need to know that their valuable vote should be cast on behalf of an educated individual with genuine intentions to make a difference; someone with a true claim to be their representative. I believe my genuine intentions will reflect upon my work and would offer an incentive for people to make a choice to vote for me.Q. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT BEING A POLITICIAN�S DAUGHTER IS A QUALIFICATION FOR YOU TO ENTER POLITICS?A: Even during the Nominations Board interview on Monday, it was repeatedly mentioned by the board members that my father had not even mentioned my appearance before the Board at least through a casual phone call. I wished to make an impression and make my case on my own and my father too agreed that I should convince the Board on my own, regarding my ability to contest at the upcoming provincial elections.Being linked to a political family does have its edge, but my decision to enter politics was not a na�ve choice I made to simply keep myself occupied or to entertain myself. I am thankful for the impact that I would carry due to my familial political connections but I don�t wish for it to become my whole identity.Q. WHAT ISSUES DO YOU BELIEVE SHOULD GET PRIORITY AT THE WPC ELECTIONS?A: I am planning to carry my message to the masses based on three main points � strengthening gender equality, improving living standards and helping people achieve a life free of poverty and providing accessibility to education for every child.Q. DO YOU BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOLLOWED THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION IN RESPONDING TO WAR CRIMES ALLEGATIONS AND IN DEALING WITH THE RISING PRESSURES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BEFORE THE UPCOMING UNHCR SESSIONS, ON ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES?A: I believe the government won the war fair and square and did so in order to safeguard the citizens of this country. The defeat of the LTTE was for the greater good and I believe the government has adopted the right course of action in grappling the international pressures.Q. WHAT ARE YOUR COMMENTS ON THE PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN POLITICS IN SRI LANKA, IN COMPARISON TO THE GLOBAL SITUATION? �A: I believe Sri Lanka is in a relatively better position when speaking of female participation in politics. But it can improve. Some 52% of our population is females but the political representation in comparison is disproportionate. Moreover, although certain sections of the media might attempt to portray the participation of females in politics as a battle simply among the few females, the actual competition is much more intense as at present. It is only about 15 female politicians who have been elected to local government bodies in comparison to some 300 male provincial councillors.",dengue
Use of language in its present context,"2013-12-17 19:29:40							0						 				1356","Often we hear that the youth is not interested in cultured language. Of course those who read and write in English language are bounded by traditional middle class norms and still there are norms to follow. But when it comes to Sinhala it is different. I was told that in the use of Tamil there are some strict codes and there is a common social pressure to use cultured language. However in the case of Sinhala, many learned women and men criticise the way language is used, in not so much in the print media, but certainly in electronic media. Some say that bad language has become the style of modernity. However Socialist leaders always believed that abusive language and swearing are a legacy of slavery, humiliation, and disrespect for human dignity. It shows the lack of respect for not only others but also ones own.���Linguists and experts in folklore, agree that old languages carry loose, sticky, and low terms of abuse than other languages of recent origin. Socialists and liberal thinkers stress that abusing, yelling and humiliation are products of violent and cruel class conflicts. In Europe in general, swearing in the lower depths was the result of despair, embitterment and, above all, of slavery without hope, without escape. The swearing of the upper classes, on the other hand, the swearing that came out of the throats of the gentry, the authorities, was the outcome of class rule, slave owners pride, and unshakable power.""Linguists and experts in folklore, agree that old languages carry loose, sticky, and low terms of abuse than other languages of recent origin. Socialists and liberal thinkers stress that abusing, yelling and humiliation are products of violent and cruel class conflicts""On the other hand the proverbs contain the wisdom of the masses that were eager to spend a peaceful life. One can say that peasants were slavish and justified the oppression by such wisdom. But unlike in Europe we in the Indian sub-continent did not go through periods of such oppressions. Marx accepted that societies in the Indian sub continent were clusters of organic Asiatic societies hardly disturbed by the war of kings and princes. However Trotsky said that Russian proverbs show besides the ignorant and the superstitious mind of the masses, their slavishness. Referring to the Old Russian proverb �Abuse does not stick to the collar,� he said it not only that slavery is accepted as a fact, but submits to the humiliation of it. In general European socialist critiques have said that two streams of��abuse are that of the masters, the officials, the police, replete and fatty, and the other, the hungry, desperate, tormented swearing of the masses have coloured the whole of��life with despicable patterns of abusive terms before the advent of a democratic revolution. After the victory of parliamentary democracy, this legacy rapidly evaporated not only within bourgeoisie but also among the organised working class.""However in the case of Sinhala, many learned women and men criticise the way language is used, in not so much in the print media, but certainly in electronic media. Some say that bad language has become the style of modernity""Even the democratic revolution was in the first place an awakening of human personality particularly within the urban masses. Even in Europe, though they were supposed to possess no personality, the villages were at least partially ancestral societies where they lived among kith and kin. Family ties were strong. It was the cruelty and the sanguinary relentlessness of its methods that allowed the bourgeoisie revolution to break these village bonds. Inspite of such setbacks, with the proletarian urban settlements we see above all, the awakening of humanity, its onward march, and marked with a growing respect for the personal dignity of every individual with an ever-increasing concern for those who are weak. In this respect trade unions and social movements played an important role. Western democratic��revolution does not deserve its name if, with all the means at its disposal, it did not help the woman twofold and threefold enslaved as she has been in the past to get out on the road of individual and social progress. Democratic revolution did take care of the children of the future people for whose benefit, the democracy has been established. It created day by day, if only by little bits, a new life based on mutual consideration, on self-respect, on equality of women, looked upon as fellow-workers. Even within this limited democracy we cannot tolerate an atmosphere poisoned with the roaring, rolling, ringing, and resound swearing of masters and slaves, that swearing which spares no one and stops at nothing? The struggle against� bad language is a condition of intellectual culture, just as the fight against filth and decease such as dengue is a condition of physical culture.

Trapped by Medicines: Can anyone walk out?,"2013-10-28 04:27:30							0						 				2070","Dr.� Richard� S. RajapaksaUnnecessary drugs for simple illnesses. Prescriptions of expensive brands of pharmaceuticals. Pointless laboratory tests. Unwarranted imaging such as CT and MRI. Needless medical procedures. �Diseases� that do not exist, but are �treated�. This is a world-wide phenomenon. All of which end up as profits of the pharmaceutical and medical devices industry.It is big business. The estimated turnover of the twelve largest pharmaceutical companies in the world was around US$ 450 billion in 2010. The profit of these companies alone came to almost US$ 100 billion. They are rich. They are powerful. Are they ethical? Well �..The New York Times and BBC reported on July 02, 2012 that one of the biggest companies on that rich-list pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to pay a US$3 billion (yes, 3 billion!) for settlement of the largest health-care fraud case in the U.S. and the largest payment by a drug company.The company pleaded guilty to the charges of illegal promotion of prescription of drugs, its failure to report safety data, bribing doctors, and promoting medicines for uses for which they were not licensed.A US attorney, quoted by BBC stated that the sales force of this company bribed physicians to prescribe its products �using every imaginable form of high-priced entertainment, from Hawaiian vacations [and] paying doctors millions of dollars to go on speaking tours, to tickets to Madonna concerts�Do you think that such things happen only in the United States of America? A popular Sinhala song comes to mind.According to the US Department of Justice, the previous highest settlement was US$ 2.3 billion paid by an even larger pharmaceutical multinational in 2009. It pleaded guilty to charges of illegal promotion of several of its pharmaceutical products and paying kickbacks to healthcare providers to induce them to prescribe these products.Last year, another giant multinational on the same rich-list pleaded guilty to criminal and civil charges, and paid US$ 1.5 billion. This company, among other things, had maintained a specialised sales force to market a drug using false claims, induced health care providers to use this drug and downplayed risks of the drug.There are many other such examples. The enormity of the settlement amounts reflects the enormity of the crimes. Crimes for which the imposed fines were in billions of dollars. Can this not happen elsewhere? After all, all three companies operate in many other countries, including our own.In Sri Lanka, currently, the pharmaceutical market is estimated to be worth around Rs. 50 billion annually. Assuming that the profit margins are the same as elsewhere, this year, the profit of this industry will be around Rs 10 billion.� Yes, Rs. 10,000,000,000.� Internationally, it is estimated that at around 20% of revenue is spent on marketing by the pharmaceutical industry. Some argue that this could be much higher.However, if we take the 20% estimate, at least Rs. 10,000,000,000 is doing its rounds, �marketing� pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka. In this context, �marketing� means things that an entity does to increase its sales and profits. As the examples from the US show, in this game, anything goes. That includes even Madonna concerts, in some instances.� If so, will we, the general public stand a chance?The agency responsible for regulation of pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka is the Cosmetics, Devices and Drugs Regulatory Authority, which is under the Ministry of Health. Assuming its website in up to date, currently Sri Lanka can boast of over 8,800 registered pharmaceutical formulations.This includes over 150 varieties of the anti-cholesterol drug Atorvastatin and the antibiotic Amoxicillin, almost 100 varieties of Metformin the anti-diabetic drug, over 100 varieties of Esomeprazole and around 80 varieties of Omeprazole, both medications for Gastritis, and over 70 varieties of Paracetamol and so on.� Describing this as excessive will be an understatement.Can the regulatory agency and the National Drug Quality Assurance Laboratory of the Ministry of Health be reasonably expected to assure quality of all the registered pharmaceutical drugs? It is likely that these two agencies are overwhelmed by the avalanche of products that it has to monitor.Even under such trying circumstances, according to the regulatory agency website, no less than 66 drug formulations have been found to be of poor quality and have been removed from the market in Sri Lanka this year. There are many injectable drugs in this list, which we all know are given to severely ill patients. There were also eye drops, drugs for diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, asthma heart disease, mental illnesses as well as antibiotics among them.Many questions arise. Were you, your child, husband, wife, father, mother, brother or sister given these drugs before their dubious �quality� was discovered? Were there losses of life? How many suffered adverse reactions? How many had their illness and sufferings prolonged? How many other such �medicines� are out there right now? We will never know.However, the answers to the following questions are certain. Will those who suffered be compensated? No chance. Will those responsible for releasing at least some of these on us ever be punished? No way.So, we the public,� are not only paying more for drugs, submitting ourselves to needless tests, being treated for non-existent conditions etc. etc., but also gobbling up and getting injected with dubious substances which we think are medicines.

Some argue that this could be much higher. ""			This should not happen in Sri Lanka, which, in past has shown the world how the pharmaceutical market can be regulated, for the benefit of the people. The World Health Organization is taking this concept, developed in Sri Lanka, worldwide, and people of many countries have benefited.� Paradoxically, the same principles are eroded to almost unrecognisable levels here.Are doctors victims too? Yes, if victimhood is defined as being manipulated into harming those you are supposed to protect, for others to profit. In the Sri Lankan context, this can even be described as being manipulated into harming those who paid for your education since you were 5 years old, until you passed out as a doctor, or in some cases until you specialised.Even doctors who are honest and ethical face a dilemma in situations where there is no confidence can be placed on the drug regulatory system. Should he prescribe the least expensive drug? Or the more expensive brand? How can he be sure of the quality of the drug which he has prescribed? Will he not be more inclined to prescribe an expensive brand? The pharmaceutical industry marketers are skillful at playing on these fears.How do the doctors who knowingly toe the line of the pharmaceutical industry justify their behaviour? Probably as any other individual would justify a behaviour that the person knows is unbecoming himself. The pharmaceutical industry has mastered this art of �helping� such doctors to maintain this behaviour. Once the tried tested methods of manipulation kicks in, professionalism, ethics or perceived rationality offer no protection.They become puppets. Puppets whose chains originate in corporate offices.� Chains that are pulled by those unseen by the puppets. Puppets, who in turn manipulate the poor and the helpless.� Puppeteers rake in the riches. Puppets get the crumbs. The manipulated gets none.The process of psychological manipulation of doctors has been detailed lucidly in a recent publication by academics of the Georgetown University and the Ethics Centre of Harvard University of the USA, entitled �Physicians under the Influence: Social Psychology and Industry Marketing Strategies�.There, its authors state: �Pharmaceutical and medical device companies apply social psychology to influence physicians� prescribing behaviour and decision making. Physicians fail to recognise their vulnerability to commercial influences due to self-serving bias, rationalisation, and cognitive dissonance. Professionalism offers little protection; even the most conscious and genuine commitment to ethical behaviour cannot eliminate unintentional, subconscious bias.�The marketing strategy, according to the authors, relies on creating the �illusion that the industry is a generous avuncular partner to physicians.�What is the solution they offer? �A culture in which accepting industry gifts engenders shame rather than gratitude will reduce conflicts of interest�. Yes, calling a spade a spade. Bribes as bribes. Recognising shameless behaviour as shameless behaviour.Is there any hope? There is. Doctors are supposed to be intelligent beings. They should abhor being manipulated, especially being manipulated to act against the interests of patients whom they are bound professionally, morally and ethically to protect.They should be the bulwark between the puppet masters and us. The authors of the study state it more elegantly.� �In order to resist industry influence, physicians must accept that they are vulnerable to subconscious bias, and have both the motivation and means to resist industry influence�.Where does all this leave the rest of us? However rich, influential, or educated we are, all of us are victims of this charade. To make things worse, the marketing arms of the pharmaceutical industry play almost the same tricks with us, as with doctors.For example many of us would consider the most expensive brand of a drug as more effective than a less expensive brand of the same drug. Whether this is true or not, cannot be stated with certainty, where regulatory systems are weak or overwhelmed. Especially in an age when counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals is rife. Even the prescriber or the pharmacist is none the wiser.For individuals there is little choice. The least we can do is discussing this issue with our doctors or pharmacists, if there is any chance. The more empowered, insightful and influential amongst us should look at the ways of changing this culture of manipulation for individual and corporate profit. We should attempt to change this milieu that promotes accumulating riches by robbing the ill and the frightened.As always, the vector of the problem should be addressed. Remember, mosquito breeding is controlled to control dengue. The same principal should apply. The pharmaceutical industry, the puppet master, should be controlled through all available means. Talk is cheap. It is the action that counts. �Reigning in this rampant industry and making it work for the benefit of the people is possible. Many countries are moving in the right direction. Sri Lanka once led the world in this issue. We should take the lead once again.The writer can be reached at RichardRajapaksa@gmail.com",dengue
Editorial - Cancer in the health service,"2013-10-28 04:13:16							0						 				1807","The latest scandal at the National Cancer Institute in Maharagama is a symptom of how much Sri Lanka�s health service has degenerated. It also gives a clear diagnosis of the need for the Rajapaksa regime�amid fanfare of expressways and other showpiece projects at skyrocketing costs�to act urgently in restoring a health service where the well-being of the patients is given top priority.According to reports, five pharmacists attached to the Maharagama Cancer Institute have been interdicted for alleged involvement in a racket relating to highly expensive cancer drugs given to child victims of the dreaded decease. The pharmacists are alleged to have resold vials of this drug valued at about Rs. 237,000 each, to a pharmaceutical company which allegedly resold them to the cancer institute. The CID has been called in to probe the racket involving up to one million rupees. Health Ministry officials say the pharmacists, if they are found guilty, will have to repay the money, while the pharmaceutical company has been blacklisted.� But as we often see in the multitude of medical frauds today, the pharmaceutical company says a rival company has concocted this story to ruin its reputation.In recent decades we have seen a tragic or deadly trend where medicine, which was once based on the hallowed precepts of the Hippocratic Oath, gradually became a money-making profession and is now largely a business. Trans-national drug companies have become one of the biggest profit-making industries in the world with all sorts of double dealing and corruption. Private hospitals have also become big business as are pharmacies which are spreading all over the country like the dengue epidemic. The unkindest cut is that a large number of medical consultants appear to be colluding in the corruption of the medical service by accepting scholarships and sponsorships, pleasure cruises and other inducements from the trans-national companies.Amid all these unhealthy if not sickening developments, insiders say the cancer in the health sector is spreading far and wide in a way that is affecting even the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), which is the supreme governing body for medical ethics and related issues in Sri Lanka. One of Sri Lanka�s most eminent physicians Professor Carlo Fonseka has hitherto been conducting the affairs of the SLMC according to the highest traditions and principles despite pressure from various quarters which have vested interests.But now in a move connected to the controversial private medical college in Malabe it is alleged that a powerful minister is trying to put pressure on the SLMC Chairman to retire. Insiders also say the minister is trying to promote another professor against whom several allegations have been made and sworn affidavits have been submitted. Questions are being asked by other respected medical professionals as to how and why a minister not connected with the health service is interfering with the work of the SLMC. �The private medical college in Malabe and the proposed Meerigama campus of a British University are turning out to be major issues threatening the foundations of two of Sri Lanka�s vital policies�the free health service and free education. If these crumble, Sri Lanka is in danger of producing a new generation that is largely unhealthy and not properly educated. This means all the expressways might carry us to a crash landing because Sri Lanka will lose its most precious treasure�the next generation.",dengue
Policy makers challenged by ageing population,"2013-10-23 18:42:37							1						 				2584","Unlike in the 19th century the biggest demographic scare of this age is not the increasing population and the decreasing food resources. Although scarcity of food resources continues to remain a threat, the boom of the ageing population seemed to have gripped the policy makers, demographers and sociologists with concern� as the life expectancy rates are increasing while the birth rates are falling not only in �rich� countries but also in emerging countries.The �greying of the globe� will eventually become a challenge to every nation and with the rising geriatric population countries need to be prepared to provide the required medical, social as well as emotional support to the growing elderly population. Dr. Anula Wijesundara, a consultant physician at the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital spoke about these challenges that Sri Lanka should tackle especially with concern to providing medical care for those above 65 years. With years of research in London about geriatric care and her wealth of experience as a physician in Sri Lanka Dr. Wijesundara shared her views about medical needs and the social support that have to be rendered to the rising ageing population.�Caring for our elders is very important because it addresses the basics of humanity. It�s the way we can show our gratitude to the generation that was instrumental in raising the current working population. Actually ageing should be perceived as an achievement because a person has survived all the hardships of life� pointed out Dr. Wijesundara emphasising on the importance of focusing on geriatric care.Elderly population in Sri LankaAccording to Dr. Jayasundara not just the developed countries, even rising nations face the challenges that arise with rising geriatric population. In Sri Lanka the rise of the population above 65 years of age will be 200% by 2050. Referring to the statistics from the Population Pyramids of the World she pointed out that in year 2000 the aged population�s rise was only 9% and added there is a marked increase in the Sri Lankan ageing population while the overall population rise has not experienced such a growth. She noted that among the Asian countries Sri Lanka stands as the 5th country to have the highest number of geriatric citizens and added that the health care system should be focused on addressing the needs of the geriatric as even now about 90% of the medical beds in state hospitals are occupied by patients over 65 years except during an epidemic of dengue.An integrated health care system�Our physicians in Sri Lanka have done a fantastic job in treating the geriatric even though our country does not have a separate discipline or wards to treat the geriatric. It is also important to stress upon the need to have an integrated health care system where specialised units for geriatrics will function with geriatricians and other professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, social workers, nurses and care givers� she said.Currently, Sri Lanka does not posses separate units in any hospitals to treat the elderly. Dr. Wijesundara said, in the United States there are about 7000 geriatricians which means, to a population of 10,000 there are 3.8 geriatricians. However since Sri Lanka only recently introduced a post graduate diploma on geriatric medicine, currently there are no geriatricians in Sri Lanka. While Dr. Wijesundara said the situation will change overtime, as there is increased concern and interest over this area of medicine, she said the integrated system should not focus solely on producing geriatricians.Minimal drugs and early diagnosis importantThe diseases suffered by the elderly are often difficult to diagnose when compared to a person who is young, as the symptoms of a disease do not manifest very clearly in the case of a person who is above 65 years of age.�If an elderly person is experiencing cardiac arrest he will most probably get a mild chest pain whereas in a young person it is very easy to detect because the chest pain is severe. This is just a simple example, but usually early diagnosis is important as the symptoms manifest mildly or maybe delayed, and treating the disease earlier will reduce the risk posed to the patient�s life� said Dr. Wijesundara.She also emphasised that the number of drugs prescribed to the geriatric should be kept to a minimal, as treating one disease with several drugs would complicate the symptoms leading into late diagnosis causing considerable risk to the patient�s life.Dr. Wijesundara said, conditions such as Alzheimer�s, Dementia and Parkinson�s disease should be given special focus, as patients who have these conditions require regular and undivided attention of care-givers to lead an emotionally and physically healthy life.�There are about 120,000 Dementia patients in Sri Lanka and they have to be looked after through day-care, care-giving and patient education facilities. For Alzheimer patients in Sri Lanka there is a foundation which is called Lanka�Alzheimer�s Foundation at Ketawalamulla�Lane in Maradana, and it provides free services such as memory testing to help patients. More such organisations should be established to create a social support system in Sri Lanka,� she said.Family Environment is the bestCommenting on the social and familial support elders should be provided with, Dr. Jayasundara was of the view that placing elders in their family environment is the ideal way to take care of them.�Though there are special homes for elders, still in Sri Lanka children make it their responsibility to look after their elderly parents in almost all the families. With busy life-styles and economic hardships this could be a challenge, but the ideal environment for a geriatric is his or her home or family environment. In Asian countries the concept of extended families have helped the elderly and the young generation and we should continue this tradition,� she said.�Some elderly people adjust well when they are in elders� homes as they are with people who are in the same generation, but in most cases the elderly feel depressed and isolated when they are removed from their family, so the best choice is to provide the geriatric with love and affection in their family environment,�Dr. Wijesundara said.",dengue

For some mysterious reason or reasons, nothing seems to work. Everything seems to work the other way; the way of the burger merchants and the chocolatiers, and the alcohol and tobacco industries. WHY?There are multiple answers. However, let me draw your attention to one.Have you ever seen an advertisement from a burger merchant giving a list of advantages of consumption of their particular burgers with a full list of ingredients used to make the burgers?Have you ever seen any similar advertisement for a chocolate?What about alcohol and tobacco products?THE ANSWER IS NO.They always use a different kind of communication. All the burger advertisements are very attractive. They are full of succulent, yummy-looking, colourful burgers with happy, vibrant, energetic, slender young people eating them.Or they show you moments that are so pleasant and heart-warming, you stop and look at the advertisement for at least a moment. �Wow! That�s attractive� is what they scream to the public.Appealing to the heart, but not to the brain. The chocolate advertisement does not give you facts, numbers, tables and figures of the specifics of the product or its benefits to the user.The advertisement fills your heart with powerful emotions completely unrelated to chocolate. They have little or no dealing with your brain.On the alcohol advertisement you see a sensual, voluptuous woman looking at you in a very inviting manner so subtle, that you are not sure if she is actually smiling or trying to whisper something in your ear. These advertisements are full of strong appeals directed straight at you. They envelope your emotions.The marketing world has a very powerful, accurate, nimble tool to separate the good from the bad in the vast and complex world of advertising.From sales figures they can calculate at once which advertisement worked and which did not. They can work out which campaign was successful and which was a flop. All thanks to the feedback mechanism � sales figures.The marketers, therefore, have become great scientists in this field. They no longer need the theoretical psychologist to predict human behaviour in the market, nor do they need the economist to match the manufacture of the product against the demand. They know what works and what does not. They have learnt this in the real world. Their mistakes have been their best teacher. The advertising industry has reached unprecedented heights in the modern world.Advertising experts know how to change human behaviour. They know how to make an Eskimo purchase a refrigerator. They even know how to get doctors to prescribe the more expensive medications. And to prescribe medications for people who do not actually need them. Pharmaceutical giants spend billions of dollars to tap into the emotions of the doctors. They know how to do it. They have got the technology.We must learn this technology from the advertising world.� Use the same technology to initiate the behaviour change we need. Only then will the caring doctor, health worker, sociologist and good citizen achieve the targets that have been elusive all this time.The doctor does not have the luxury of a prompt indicator which tells her which intervention worked and which one did not. She has to wait years to know if the new guideline on management of diabetes was effective in preventing its complications. This is cumbersome, which is the way it is done now.Thanks to the marketing world, without doing years of cumbersome research, we know that the awesome task of taking the human heart by storm is more likely to be effective than appealing to the human brain.Metaphorically speaking, of course. We had all this time been talking to the brains of people with facts, figures, lists, numbers, ideas, words and thoughts. How about now paying more attention to emotions, feelings, impulses and motivation?The neurobiology explains why this is effective. The advertising world knew little about the neurobiology of emotions. They thrived without knowing it, thanks to their magical feedback mechanism, which is a sales figure.The human brain is full of grey matter, the majority of which is known as the neocortex. This is the evolutionary most advance part of the brain. The brain that comes second has only a fraction of neocortex of the human brain. However buried deep down inside the brain, there are tiny bubbles of grey matter known as the limbic system. This is more prominent in other vertebrates. They are lower in evolutionary terms compared to the human.The neocortex is our brain. And the limbic system is our heart. Metaphorically speaking again, the neocortex handles our thoughts, maths, reasoning, ideas, words and their abstract meanings.The limbic system handles our emotions such as fears, lusts, joys, drives and� rage related to what is received by the neocortex. The simple, shameful, unbeatable truth is that the limbic system can override the neocortex - almost always. Whenever the limbic activity is powerful, it is almost impossible for neocortex to override limbic system.The advertisements connect with our limbic system. Emotions are one way that connection is made; perhaps the most powerful way.Finally the good people in the modern world have started to realise this. We now do try to address emotions. The modern health worker, sociologist and good citizen do make an attempt to talk to the heart as well, and very powerfully too.That is why we see less of long, boring, unattractive, cluttered advertisements on dengue prevention, or child abuse, or violence against women.The more attractive, powerful, emotional and sometimes provocative advertisements are, they call us into action. Good people are becoming more effective in their communication."" Advertising experts know how to change human behaviour. They know how to make an Eskimo purchase a refrigerator. They even know how to get doctors to prescribe the more expensive medications. And to prescribe medications for people who do not actually need them ""That is why we see obese, unhealthy, gross men and women holding burgers and colas and warning us about what happened to them.That is why we see a growing trend in the world, in enforcement of the use of large, graphic, gruesome images of the actual health effects of tobacco smoking on packaging of tobacco products. This would reverse the attempts of the tobacco industry of targeting the hearts of children and youth. Sri Lanka should not be left behind in this exciting and effective trend to save our future generation.We, the families, doctors, sociologists, good citizens have come of age.There is no going back now. We have learnt to beat them at their own game using their own technology. We are going to win.(Rajasuriya.Online @gmail.com)",dengue

Leprosy poses serious challenge for Sri Lanka,"2013-08-20 20:14:17							0						 				4474","Most Sri Lankans including the professionals believe that Leprosy does not exist in Sri Lanka today. Some believe that it has been eliminated. A small group of people feel that the disease has been eradicated. Yet for a remaining group, the disease is here with us, but not in a worrisome scale.To refresh our minds, Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium. So far as present knowledge goes, it is transmitted from one human to another through the nose and mouth. Bacteria from a person with leprosy are spread from the mouth or nose, through the same routes to a healthy person. Some of us have the immunity and therefore a random exposure to few bacteria will not cause the disease, but if we did not have the immunity, we are at risk of getting it following an exposure.""Modern medicine tells us that Leprosy is caused by a bacterium that affects the human skin and the nerves mainly. The causative bacterium multiplies slowly and thrives well in part of the body where oxygen supplies are poor""Leprosy�s incubation periods which is the time taken by the bacteria to show the symptoms since entering the body, could be years, preventing health workers tracking the source of infection. This makes the victims theorize on the aetiology, suspect the diagnosis and even run away from treatment. �No one in my family ever had it, so how can I have it?� is the usual complaint of such worried patients.Body�s immunity against the invading bacteria plays a big role and determines the nature of subsequent unfolding of the disease. Some do not get it at all, while others end up with a controlled version of the disease called the �Pausibacillary� type in which the number of lesions is limited. When there is less immunity or no immunity in the body at the time of exposure there is a likelihood that the more severe kind known as the �Multibacillary� type to manifest. It is this condition and not the former, which is infective and leads to the transmission of the disease to otherwise normal people. Both types of course need to be treated.Most Sri Lankans are possessed with several layers of memories as a response to the trigger word Leprosy, �Laduru� in Sinhala and �Thola Noi� in Tamil. �Dreadful disease� is one such response. Handela or Manthiev Leprosarium is another. Disability and disfigurement is yet another. Seclusion, criminality and moral degradation are also ideas that surface in during discussions. Except for the few enlightened people exposed to medical knowledge, the above constitutes the �knowns� for leprosy for the ordinary folk.Such ordinary discourses contribute to the construction of what the health people refer to as Stigma. Stigma is a set of ideas and perceptions of common people and they determine the individual and societal response to the disease. Such stigmatising ideas shape the illness experiences of these patients, their compliance with the treatment and subsequently with coping of any resulting disability. Stigma operates subconsciously in the minds of patients, their family members and with the society at large that does not exclude the health workers.""Leprosy�s incubation periods which is the time taken by the bacteria to show the symptoms since entering the body, could be years, preventing health workers tracking the source of infection. This makes the victims theorize on the aetiology, suspect the diagnosis and even run away from treatment. �No one in my family ever had it, so how can I have it?� is the usual complaint of such worried patients""Modern medicine tells us that Leprosy is caused by a bacterium that affects the human skin and the nerves mainly. The causative bacterium multiplies slowly and thrives well in part of the body where oxygen supplies are poor. This explains the preponderance of the lesions in the peripheries of the body or the extremities. Most of the time, the disease is limited to a single skin patch that is ignored by many patients. But among those with the multibacillary type of the disease, multiple lesions are common. This type of the disease affects the nerves as well causing numbness, loss of sensation and subsequently resulting in functional disabilities known as �claw hand� and �foot drop�. When such disabilities manifest, patients need special medical interventions. But the common single lesion can be treated easily.Leprosy medication comprises of prescribing to patients a combination of antibiotics. This treatment is known as, Multi Drug Therapy, or MDT. The duration of treatment varies with the type of Leprosy and sometimes with the severity of the disease. Research has shown that most of the harmful bacteria can be eliminated with a month or two of MDT treatment. The ��Multibaccillary� type should receive at least twelve months of treatment. MDT comes in blister packs and is provided free of charge at the government hospitals. Although MDT clears all the bacteria, it will not bring back functional disabilities caused by the bacteria. Effective MDT treatment will put a stop to transmission of the disease. Medical treatment of disabilities requires prolonged specialized attention that will be costly to both the patients and to the health system. Leprosy will only be a simple skin condition if not for the disabilities caused by nerve damage.""With the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka, there is more movement of people. Some of the displaced people are returning from India. Given this, the number of new cases detected in areas where traditionally only a few cases were found, is likely to increase. In Jaffna district alone such an increase has been observed in 2012""World over the number of new cases of Leprosy has diminished. In the West this reduction came long before the MDT was invented. Living conditions, overcrowding and poor socio-economic conditions seem to contribute to the spreading of the disease. Improvements in such areas contributed to the decline of Leprosy in the West. Close human contact and poor immunity are the contributing factors for rapid transmission of the disease in such contexts.Sri Lanka is one of the few countries in world that still produces over one thousand new cases a year. In 2012, the number of new cases detected over 2000 new cases. Half of them have been detected from the affluent Western Province. The rest came from districts such as Batticaloa, Ampara, Matara, Puttalam, Hambantota and Polonnaruwa. In Sri Lanka all diagnoses are confirmed by consultant dermatologists who later treat them. A yearly average of 1800-2000 new cases has been detected in Sri Lanka for the last decade and the challenge to reduce this rate has continued. Children below 15 years are not spared and the proportions of children affected are high in Sri Lanka. The disease seems to affect men and women equally.What worries the health authorities is the continuous, uncontrolled detection of a 2000 cases more or less each year. There is no indication that it will take a downward turn any sooner.The health authorities are also worried that only a half of the patients who got MDT treatment got it within six months of observing a lesion. The rest of the patients took more than a year to obtain proper treatment. Patients reporting for the first time with a deformity due to leprosy clearly are the victims of this delay in getting the proper treatment. They had waited until the bacterium caused them nerve damage that will be difficult to correct. For a country with high literacy, good health service, good accessibility to health facilities and free health service, this is unacceptable. The deformity rates among new patients at the time of diagnosis, is also high for Sri Lanka.With the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka, there is more movement of people. Some of the displaced people are returning from India. Given this, the number of new cases detected in areas where traditionally only a few cases were found, is likely to increase. In Jaffna district alone such an increase has been observed in 2012.What worries the leprosy worker most is the general apathy shown towards this disease by the common citizens, politicians and the officials. While most of the attention is now drawn to control of Dengue, Kidney Disease and Obesity, in the minds of officials and public, Leprosy is no more � eliminated- taken care of. Meanwhile, each year about 250 individuals join the disability group because of Leprosy. In a period of 10 years it will be 2500 Sri Lankans who will probably need lifelong disability care. By making suspecting cases of Leprosy to access MDT treatment as soon as possible, such a burden can be minimized. This means that denial of correct treatment has many consequences that go beyond the misery of the individual patient.While early diagnosis and treatment is an important step towards spreading of the disease, it is also important to diagnose as much cases as possible. The �risk group� in Leprosy is close contacts to whom a patient may have given the disease or have got the disease from the same primary source. It is therefore very important for all contacts of patients such as family members, neighbours and significant others to be checked for signs and symptoms of Leprosy by doctors and have them treated if found to be infected. It is also important for patients who are on treatment to continue the treatment according to medical advice without making their own decisions about the possible outcomes. All patients found with disabilities need specialized care and will be referred to such treatment centres. Leprosy is a disease for which no benefit is likely to come by changing doctors.Making the suspected cases come for treatment, making the patients on treatment to continue treatment to its conclusion and making patients to bring their contacts for medical examinations will play a major determinant role in the fight against Leprosy. All this could only be enhanced with an effective counselling process.Anti-Leprosy Campaign has now developed a three year national plan of action. Organizations such as FAIRMED FOUNDATION and the World Health Organisation have offered technical and financial support to the national programme. All what is now needed is the public and the officials to take the challenge on their shoulders and the Sri Lankans across board to assist the public health staff to do their job. The disease can be curtailed by breaking the transmission lines by providing treatment as early as possible - although this might take some time to see the results.To curb the spreading of the disease, Sri Lanka has many favourable factors at her disposal. A good and an effective public Health system, highly trained staff, medical professionals as district administrators, epidemiologists and a network of medical officers of health, well equipped health facilities and easy accessibility to health institutions using buses or three wheelers and what more, -a free health service.Given all this, it will be a shame if Sri Lanka could not curtail the transmission of Leprosy and even eradicate the disease for her 20 million islanders.Email: fairmedcolombo@yaho.com",dengue
Can national healthcare meet challenges of the future?,"2013-07-11 19:03:26							0						 				1925","It is important to take note of these achievements as well as residual and new challenges. This is crucial because Sri Lanka is at a transition stage. Its demographic, epidemiological and public health demands are evolving. That aside, after 30 years of conflict, it is beginning to rebuild its economy and looking towards a sustained peace dividend. Inevitably, this will lead to changes that would have implications for its health sector as well.Sri Lanka is unusual among developing countries in that it has a robust public health network, with more than 1,000 institutions across the country. Most Sri Lankans live within three km of a public health facility. While there is a system of primary and referral facilities, in practice patients are free to go to the institution of their choice and the one that is most accessible. This is remarkable even when compared to developed and Western countries that have widespread public health systems.Tellingly, it is rooted in Sri Lankan tradition. The chronicles of King Dutugemunu, dating back to the second century BC, document the creation of a nationwide network of 18 hospitals. This is among history�s earliest records of planned public-health infrastructure augmentation and capacity building.Much of Sri Lanka�s gains in the health sector have been the result of focused and intelligent government spending. Public outlay on health amounts to 1.7 per cent of GDP (2008 figures). This is significantly higher than the 1.3 per cent of GDP average for South Asia and also places Sri Lanka as among the better performing of the 11 countries of the World Health Organisation (WHO) South-East Asian Region.While this is a solid base to build on, it needs to be recognised that the future trajectory of public health issues in Sri Lanka might deviate from the known path. This would be triggered by social and economic evolution, new compulsions and the changes in people�s needs. Much of what Sri Lanka goes through in the coming years, in health and medical as well as economic and social transitions and its responses to these, would offer lessons for its neighbours and other nations that are similarly placed.For a start, there is the accelerated rise of the private sector as a health-care provider. While public/government spending on health is a strong 1.7 per cent of GDP (as we saw earlier), it is matched and even bettered by private sector spending (1.8 per cent of GDP). Gradually a pattern is emerging. The public sector appears to dominate inpatient provision (over 90 per cent). The outpatient burden is seeing an expanding role for the private sector, concentrated in urban areas.This has implications for health financing, especially in a society that has pioneered a �health for all� approach paid for by tax revenues and managed by the state. Long waiting times in public health facilities � not unknown in other parts of the world either � the quicker availability of new technologies developed elsewhere, the propensity of people to seek direct specialist care, even without primary referrals, is increasing out-of-pocket expenses.This process is being pushed ahead by rising incomes, following recent years of economic growth. As a consequence, equity, one of the cornerstones of the public health policies of the Sri Lankan government, is starting to come under pressure. How this is addressed by Sri Lankan health authorities would be enormously educative for other countries.Like many other emerging and newly-independent nations in the second-half of the 20th century, Sri Lanka worked hard to address communicable diseases and vaccine preventable diseases. Today, though, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading killers. Urbanisation, lifestyle transformations and related factors are causing a surge in cases of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, various cancers and carcinomas.Even so, communicable diseases have not ceased to be a threat. While the number of mortalities may be small, Dengue, Leptospirosis and Tuberculosis remain a problem or have encountered a recrudescence. In the recent past, Sri Lanka has also felt the impact of disease epidemics such as the H1N1 Influenza outbreak. A greying population points to anticipated gaps in areas such as rehabilitation, medicine and geriatrics.Sri Lanka has done well in respect of the Millennium Development Goals and reduced its infant and maternal mortality rates sharply. Nevertheless maternal and child under-nutrition are noticeable. One in six children born in the country is of low birth weight, a predicament that could have long-term physical and cognitive consequences.This set of emergent challenges will require inter-sectoral collaboration (to neutralise for example the phenomenon of under-nutrition), meeting human resources lacunae (among others for care-givers and specialists who can work with the significant elderly population), and pursuing an information and communication programme that would stress the cheaper option of NCDs prevention rather than the more expensive one of NCDs treatment.To be fair, the Sri Lankan government is alive to these realities, and is putting in place mechanisms to meet them. The efficacy and success of these mechanisms would be closely watched. When it set up an exemplary basic health-care system, Sri Lanka constructed a template for other developing countries. Now, as it copes with the health implications of its many parallel transitions, it has a chance to repeat history.The author is a noted international public health specialist and former Deputy Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region",dengue
Video: Minister seeks truth behind saline �conspiracy�,"2013-07-09 13:31:40							3						 				3306","Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena today instructed Health Secretary Nihal Jayathilake to lodge a complaint with the CID to find the truth behind the alleged contaminated bottles of saline from government hospitals.		This followed a health sector trade union allegation that contaminated saline had been given to dengue patients at government hospitals, putting their lives at risk. The trade union also alleged that there was the danger of the entire stock of saline - Dextran 40 imported from Thailand for dengue patients may have been contaminated.		The trade union showing a bottle of Dextran 40 saline, displayed particles found in the bottle saying it was contaminated and the lives of dengue patients were at risk if given the saline.		Addressing a news briefing at the Health Education Bureau today, Director Medical Supplies Division, Dr. Kamal Jayasinghe, while dismissing the allegations said Dextran 40 saline had to be stored under the temperature of 25 degrees Fahrenheit and if the temperature went up there was the possibility of the glucose contained in the bottle to become clotted.		�Anyone can expose a bottle of Dextran 40 to the sun and make the particles gather inside the bottle. However, we have instructed hospital directors not to give Dextran 40 to Dengue patients if they found particles inside,� Dr. Jayasinghe said.		Dr. Hemantha Benaragama, Director National Drugs Quality Assurance Authority Chairman charged that the allegations were unfounded or due to lack of knowledge, but it could also be for the purpose of sabotaging the Dengue control programme.		He added that the particular company that won the tender to export Dextran 40 to Sri Lanka was the only company that produced the saline. The tender was also won by this Thai company for saline supply as that company was the only bidder. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)	?WATCHVideo by Indika Sri Aravinda",dengue

Revamping Healthcare Services in Sri Lanka,"2013-07-01 04:13:25							1						 				2743","Healthcare absorbs a major part of public and private expenditure in almost all countries around the world. In some developed countries, it hovers around 15% of the GDP. The increasing cost of healthcare provision is partly a reflection of growing commercial interests in healthcare and partly the result of the increasing cost of labour, medical technology and pharmaceuticals. The expansion of the health sector has undoubtedly led to improved quality and choice of healthcare services, though increasing costs have also imposed greater economic burdens on end users of such services. Even though various risk sharing arrangements such as national and private health insurance schemes have cushioned patients and their families against prohibitive health costs to a great extent, the cost of health insurance itself has become a significant burden on low-income groups in some countries.As is well known, the provision of basic healthcare to citizens� by the state free of charge has ensured almost universal access to at least basic health facilities in all parts of Sri Lanka. Yet inadequate public investments in the health sector in a context of increasing cost of labour, equipment and drugs have resulted in poor quality health care, overcrowding of large hospitals and inadequate services in rural areas. The situation changed often for the worse when private healthcare providers emerged following the introduction of liberal economic reforms in 1977. The rise of the private health sector enabled the well-to-do patients to rely entirely on private healthcare services, relegating the poor to often poor quality public health services.The result is a widening gap between private and public institutions in terms of the availability and quality of health facilities. This has encouraged even non-affluent patients to rely on private providers, at least for out-patient treatment and routine medical tests. This is clearly evident from official statistics on in-patient and out-patient treatment in the country. In the absence of affordable private or public health insurance, out of pocket expenses incurred by patients have become a severe burden on households. Yet, many people do not see an alternative as publicly provided health services are often inadequate and unsatisfactory.It is unrealistic to expect any significant increase in public expenditure in real terms in the near future for economic and political reasons. The present public finances in the country do not permit large additional allocations for the social sectors like health and education unless there is a major reallocation of public resources across different sectors of public investment. Given the current development thinking and political priorities, it is unrealistic to expect any major shift in a way the public resources are allocated across different sectors. In other words, socially important sectors such as health, education and social protection are unlikely get priority treatment. Given this situation, it is necessary to figure out what sort of reforms are feasible in order to improve the performance of the health sector. An attempt is made below to identify and list several areas that can be strengthened with minimal additional resources.� These can be outlined under the following topics:			Optimal use of existing resources within the health sector			Mix of health care institutions			Relationship between public and private institutions			Role of health insurance and nInter-sectoral action to deal with health issuesAs mentioned earlier, private providers of healthcare play a significant part in the health sector today. Though they make use of�� many medical specialists attached to public institutions, private healthcare institutions are run entirely as private enterprises. Patients usually have to pay fees upfront and often do not get such expenses reimbursed as they are not covered by health insurance. This situation restricts private residential care to a small minority of affluent patients or those who are covered by limited private health insurance available in the country. This is a major constraint to the expansion of private healthcare institutions.� What is also noteworthy is the absence of private but non-profit healthcare institutions in the country.It is necessary to go beyond the present duality between private and public healthcare institutions and diversify the institutional mix in the health sector. The establishment of healthcare institutions as non-profit, social enterprises and the introduction of affordable health insurance schemes could potentially facilitate the expansion and diversification of healthcare facilities leading to optimal mobilisation and utilisation of resources in the sector for the benefit of patents belonging to all social strata. The present polarisation between public and private healthcare institutions is neither rational nor socially just."" Yet inadequate public investments in the health sector in a context of increasing cost of labour, equipment and drugs have resulted in poor quality health care, overcrowding of large hospitals and inadequate services in rural areas ""As is well known, Sri Lanka does not have a systematic referral system. It is not mandatory for a GP to refer a patient to a specialist, particularly in the private sector. So, most patients go direct to specialists, thereby creating long waiting lines at private consultation rooms. Moreover, patients are not well distributed among GPs as the spatial distribution of GPs is not regulated. Many patients do not go to the same GP on a regular basis and, as a result, the management of case loads is not done in a systematic fashion. As is well known, the services provided by GPs are critically important for the health system in terms of treatment, monitoring and follow-up of cases. GPs provide a critical link between the community and the healthcare institution. If the patients first go to a GP, the number of patients turning up at specialist consultation rooms will be drastically reduced, allowing specialists to allocate more time for patients. Yet, such a system can work only if realistic fee structures are worked out and patients are covered by health insurance that reimburses most of their out-of-pocket expenses.An overall� reduction of the disease burden in a country is critical for the effective functioning of a modern healthcare system. In other words, disease prevention through inter-sectoral action needs to be elevated to a higher level goal of the health sector. The measures needed to be taken go beyond the health sector and involve inter-disciplinary collaboration in research, policy formulation and programme development and inter-sectoral collaboration in public health, occupational health, environmental management, housing, sanitation, transportation, accident prevention, alcohol prevention, etc. Sri Lanka�s recurring Dengue epidemic is a clear case in point. So are widespread alcohol abuses, increasing traffic accidents, suicides and increasing non communicable diseases and inter-personal violence.Public expenditure on health in this country remains less than 2% of the GDP, though private expenditure has also been increasing. Given such a low level of expenditure, the achievements in terms of positive health indicators are noteworthy. Yet, the day-to-day experience of ordinary citizens with respect to availability, accessibility, affordability and quality� of healthcare is much to be desired. While allocation of more resources coupled with institutional improvements can go a long way in improving healthcare services, there are many other measures that can also make a significant difference. This essay has touched on some of these measures which need further analysis. Continuing to boast about our achievements in health� while being complacent about persisting issues is not the way to go about improving the quality of healthcare and health outcomes for all Sri Lankans, not just the rich and the powerful.",dengue
Ending poverty includes tackling climate change,"2013-06-26 18:30:00							0						 				2200","By Jim Yong KimOver the last 20 years, the World Bank Group has helped countries lift 663 million people out of poverty. In the next 20, we believe it is possible to end extreme poverty. This goal is within our grasp.But poverty reduction and climate change are linked. We have powerful new evidence that even if� climate change falls short of the much-discussed 4�C warmer world, we could witness the rolling back of decades of development gains and force tens of millions more to live in poverty.If we don�t confront climate change, we won�t end poverty. To help our clients prepare for the risks of a warming planet, we asked the scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytic in Germany to examine the impacts of climate change on three tropical regions: Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and South East Asia. Yesterday, we published the results of that study.Modeling a scenario of 4�C warming, the study reconfirms a climate picture we know well: extreme storms, prolonged heat waves, critical food and water shortages and widespread social and economic disruption. These impacts will interact to generate powerful climatic events, such as a significant sea-level rise and intense cyclones, which will cause intense and widespread damage. This is a future of enormous suffering.But what I found particularly startling was the report�s forecast of the impacts of 2�C warming. Given that the Earth has already warmed 0.8�C above pre-industrial levels, the 2�C climate milestone may not be far off. Under current greenhouse gas emission rates, we could reach this point in our lifetimes � in maybe 20 to 30 years.Effect on tropical regionsHow would this seemingly small shift in global temperature affect tropical regions? Here�s a snapshot of what the report�s scientists foresee.In Sub-Saharan Africa food shortages will become more common. Drought and heat will leave 40 percent of the land now growing maize unable to support that crop. Rising temperatures could cause major loss of savanna grasslands, threatening pastoral livelihoods. In South Asia, shifting rain patterns will leave some areas under water and others without enough water for power generation, agriculture or drinking. Events like the devastating Pakistan floods of 2010, which affected more than 20 million people, could become common place. More extreme droughts could stall power generation and turn rural fields barren, leading to lost income for farmers and widespread food shortages.In South East Asia, farmers, coastal communities, and large urban centers will face mounting pressures as sea levels rise, tropical cyclones increase in intensity, fish catches decrease, and coastal zones lose the protection of coral reefs.�� Many of these changes are already underway. Other changes are happening faster than predicted.The scientists tell us that sea-level rise has been occurring more rapidly than previously projected, anda rise of as much as 50 cm by the 2050s may already be unavoidable as a result of past emissions. In some cases, impacts could be felt much earlier. For example, sea-level rise of 15 cm, coupled with more intense cyclones, threatens to inundate much of Bangkok by the 2030s,unless adequate steps are taken to prepare for these events.As agriculture falters, and food and water become scarce, the pace of people migrating into informal urban settlements will accelerate. Life in these slums will be no less difficult than the life they fled. Housing made from scraps will trap heat yet provide little protection from storms, landslides or floods. Food and drinking water will become scarce, and diseases like malaria, dengue, and cholera easierto contract. Tension over access to dwindling resources may lead to conflict.This is a picture of regions undergoing �modest,� not extreme, warming. The effects of a 4�C global warming calamity would be far worse.It�s also crucial to note that, under either scenario, the poor will be hit first and hardest. This means that the people who are least responsible for raising the Earth�s temperature may suffer the gravest consequences from global warming. That is fundamentally unfair.We humans - all of us, everywhere - have built lives, governments and cultures within a narrow range of climate conditions. But, as these regional studies clearly show, we are pushing those conditions to the limit. Storms, economic and social disruption, andpervasive hardshippose near-term threats to the tropical regionshighlighted in the report � but, eventually,these changes will impact us all.What can we do about it?For the World Bank Group, the steps are clear. First, we accept the science that humans are changing the climate. We are looking at all our business operations through a �climate lens.� Today, the Bank is helping 130 countries take action on climate change. We are supporting on-the-ground action to finance projects that help the poor grow their way out of poverty and increase their resilience to climate change. Last year, we doubled financial lending that contributes to adaptation;this trend will accelerate in the future.Second, the Bank istaking decisive steps on mitigation.We arehelping countries identify cost-effective options to reduce emissions, and exploring opportunities to deliverco-benefits, such as climate smart agriculture and resource efficiencies. The Bank�s infrastructure lending portfolio has moved toward less carbon intensive projects, and the share of renewable energy in our energy projects has doubled over the last 5 years.We are committed to doing everything we can, but the only way we will be able to stop the worst effects of climate change will be for everyone to step up their efforts, especially the largest economies that emit the most carbon.Countries must adopt aggressive national strategies for emissions reductions, and then show the political commitment needed to deliver on them. Innovation in energy efficiency and renewable energy will also prove vital to reducing carbon emissions. And countries � developed and emerging - need to make major headway in rolling back the $1.9 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies.I am convinced that we can end extreme poverty in this generation. But,as this report makes clear, we won�t get there without taking immediate, decisive steps to slow climate change.Join us in this fight.(The writer is President of the World Bank Group)",dengue

Integrated medicine -  alternative remedy for dengue - Editorial,"2013-02-07 19:55:03							1						 				2037","The Daily Mirror on Wednesday reported the sad news of the loss of 220 precious lives out of 44,395 dengue cases reported last year. The dengue cases for last month have hit a record level.It is indeed a matter of serious concern that the Government is unable to contain this epidemic of dengue and unwilling to implement the principle of integrated medicine whereby cures for various diseases are available in different forms of medicine such as allopathy, ayurveda, homoeopathy and acupuncture.For instance homoeopathy consultants say an effective cure is available for dengue but the western medical profession refuses to accept this remedy known as Eupatorium Perfoliatum 200c in the wet dose. It is being used extensively in many countries including India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to treat this deadly disease, for which there is no known drug in the Western Pharmacopeia. Doctors in Sri Lanka have been ordered to use only permitted drugs including Paracetamol to treat this disease. All these drugs are limited in their effectiveness.Homoeopathic Consultant Joe De Livera has often been featured in this newspaper and he has shown conclusive evidence that dengue has been cured with this remedy. He says he is prepared to supply it free of charge to the medical profession on a test basis, in sealed bottles of water which are medicated. This is referred to as �wet dose�.� The Health Ministry and others, who control the western medical system, need to open their eyes to the realities of this dengue epidemic which is killing people almost on a daily basis, due to the refusal to use this homoeopathic remedy in hospitals. To make matters worse, the Health Ministry�s anti-dengue unit chief has been suspended for an alleged fraud in the funds received for anti-dengue programmes.It is ironic that doctors who are broadminded enough to use the homoeopathic remedy unofficially, have confirmed it has worked successfully, but these doctors are governed by rules which stipulate that they only use permitted drugs to treat any disease.It is not a matter of abiding by the rules to treat a disease. It is more a matter of saving precious lives by any reasonable means available.Some months ago a prominent Cabinet Minister was also affected by dengue and spent an anxious week in hospital. The consultant had informed the minister that if only the Government could be persuaded to carry out a test with this homoeopathic remedy along with the standard drugs that are being used in hospitals, the doctors could then independently verify the efficacy of the homoeopathic remedy.",dengue

Killer dengue  rides again: Try alternative cure - Editorial,"2012-11-19 18:30:00							0						 				2157","Our editorial last Saturday made a plea to the Ministry of Health to promote the use of alternate medicine such as the manioc cure for cancer. We hope this plea such as those we made in the past will not be put under some sick bed.One of the pleas we made is for the ministry and the medical profession to consider the homoeopathic remedy Eupatorium Perfoliatum to curb dengue which is raging again after the recent heavy rain.This remedy is used extensively in hospitals throughout India and Pakistan after they discovered about five years ago that this remedy cures dengue.Dengue has reached epidemic proportions in Sri Lanka during the past few years with thousands of victims and hundreds of deaths mainly in the Western Province.Hundreds of patients seek treatment in hospitals daily and the pathos of this unfortunate situation is that while the Western medical profession frankly admits it has no cure for dengue, most doctors refuse to try the homoeopathic remedy Eupatorium Perfoliatum 200c in the wet dose, in addition to their own therapy which is used in the hospitals.Homoeopathic consultant Joe De Livera who has spearheaded a drive to use this remedy to cure Dengue has supplied it free of charge to the medical profession, and a few doctors who have already used it in their own practice have certified that it has cured their patients.Health activists hope that the ministry and the medical profession will try this homoeopathic remedy in public hospitals in the same manner that it is used in India , Pakistan and other countries which suffer from the same Dengue virus.Eupatorium Perfoliatum 200c is available free in bottles of non-chlorinated water. It is recommended that a teaspoonful of the water is given to the patient every hour till the patient recovers and often this has happened within hours.Health activists hope that at least now, after the hospitals have admitted they cannot cure dengue but can only treat it, they will consider the homoeopathic cure.The homoeopathic consultant says it has also been discovered that this same remedy will abort Virus borne Flu� which are rampant at this time of the year after the wet weather. This is indeed another great discovery which many parents will welcome, to treat their children who suffer from fever.Reference was made in our editorial last Saturday to reports that the John, Hopkins Hospital recently promoted the use of Vitamin B 17 to treat Cancer. This Vitamin is found in Manioc and alternate medicine activists hope this famous US Hospital will also promote the use of Eupatorium Perfoliatum to cure dengue throughout the world.The government needs to act fast to implement a national health policy where all forms of medicine � allopathy, ayurveda, homoeopathy, acupuncture and others -- are given an equal place and Sri Lanka can become a healthier nation before moving on to the dream of becoming wealthier nation.",dengue
Flooded with agony and political chicanery,"2012-11-07 18:30:02							0						 				1704","�For the past 32 years, I don�t think I have slept soundly a single night during rains,� Shermila, a resident of Sedawatte, Kelaniya says.� Born and raised in the area and now a mother of two, this young mother says they are gripped with the fear of losing their shelter due to constant floods prevalent in the area.She lives in a small, wooden shack and the flood caused by the recent heavy rains has left permanent black stains on her walls, marking the water levels that had risen waist-high. �In other areas, it takes heavy rains that last at least 24 hours to cause floods. For the past few decades, for us in Sedawatte, floods have become part of our everyday life because it takes only about five/six hours of heavy rain for the water to flood our homes. . ,� she points out.Shermila says she and her neighbours that reside in some 400 houses in the vicinity spend only half the year in dry land, while the other half is usually spent in the midst of floods, which usually bring in a plethora of diseases.Most of the families in the area had returned to their homes only earlier this week, since they had been at the relief shelter prepared at the Gamini Vidyalaya. �When it floods, all the junk comes floating inland and stagnates in the canal. It has become the cause of many sicknesses including dengue. My children often fall ill; this time my younger son (10) fell ill and he still hasn�t recovered from the fever. Our feet are infested with strange skin diseases all year round,� she says, lifting her soles up and pointing at the festering wounds."" In other areas, it takes heavy rains that last at least 24 hours to cause floods. For the past few decades, for us in Sedawatte, floods have become part of our everyday life because it takes only about five/six hours of heavy rain for the water to flood our homes ""The residents of Sedawatte have been affected by constant floods for the past two decades and they say that time and again they have voiced their grievance to the area politicians. But a sustainable solution, which the residents claim is as simple as restoring the anicut doors has not been carried out by any they pleaded to, so far. �M. A. P. Costa, another victim of the floods prevalent in the area blames the entire issue on the area politicians. He is a resident of the Thudugalawatte Mawatha, a line of houses located parallel to the P.G. Perera Mawatha on slightly higher grounds. He points towards the lower grounds and says, �We were not affected by the issue to such a grave extent as those who live down that lane. This area started flooding due to the politicians� cheap tricks to lure voters to their side,� he says angrily.�According to Costa, each time during election campaigns, an area politician has repaired Thudugalawatta Mawatha which has led to the road level to rise higher than the ground the houses are located in. �The road is repaired on quite low standards and this has not left room for proper water flow. As a result, the rain water starts accumulating into the houses,� he points out."" We were not affected by the issue to such a grave extent as those who live down that lane. This area started flooding due to the politicians� cheap tricks to lure voters to their side ""Each time it rains, Costa says his kids or those of his neighbours can't attend school wearing shoes. �I make my child mount the cycle and I push it until we cross the flooded areas. This is such a menace, people should not be made to suffer this way because of cheap political bribing,� he says.The politicians arrive with relief when the area gets flooded but the residents of Sedawatte claimed that it is time for the politicians to stop playing political gimmicks and find a lasting solution to the issue they face year after year. For two generations the Sedawatte residents have inherited only a living hell following floods and false promises given by area politicians. The residents are still waiting to live in their houses without having to run for shelters every time it rains heavily. However, proper sanitation, clean houses and non-inundated roads during floods are yet to become realities for the Sedawatte residents.No response from the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development CorporationDespite the many attempts made by the Daily Mirror to contact the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and� Development Corporation, none of the officials could be contacted to inquire about the preventive measures that have a been taken or could be taken to minimize the flooding in the Sedawatte, Kelaniya area.The officials at the Corporation refused to comment without the permission of the Chairman of the Corporation Harshan de Silva. Even though attempts were made to contact the Chairman for two days he was not available for comment on the issue.�Kolonnawa Urban Council is the Council that has the lowest earnings�- Council ChairmanThe Kolonnawa Urban Council which is responsible for the proper water flow in Sedawatte claims that they are doing their utmost to prevent the areas from getting inundated.�We have been doing out utmost for the past several years. But the Kolonnawa Urban Council is the council which has the lowest earnings so we do have financial constraints when carrying out projects. But next year we are planning to implement� a development project in the council area which will cost up to Rs. 283 million,� said the Chairman of the Kolonnawa Urban Council, Ravindra Udayashantha.However he admitted that the anicut needs upgrading and added that the increase in the population in the area has aggravated the problem.He also noted that the most of the families are occupying low-lying lands illegally and that is why most of them complain about their homes being inundated.�Certain politicians have distributed these low- lying lands in the area as political favours to these people. Most of their houses are illegal constructions. When I assumed duties I tried to remove some of them and several law suits are also filed. But evicting them is not a solution because these people have nowhere to go. If they are evicted they will be homeless and we cannot make them homeless either. The politicians have to be blamed for distributing lands in such an unwise manner,� he claimed.He also stated that some of the lands are forcibly occupied by certain companies. He pointed out that when these lands are occupied the rain water has no space to flow making the rain water seep into the low-lying lands.The Chairman noted that the best solution is to build an apartment scheme for all the people residing in the low-lying lands but he added that that his council should be equipped with resources first.�We have done cleaning up activities and many other projects. But the mass of rain water that gushes in the area is too big for the anicut to control. So we are trying to find a lasting solution� he assured.",dengue
Ray Award,"2012-10-24 05:24:39							0						 				3396",""" I�ve rarely been able to get one of my (learned) colleagues to step into a paddy field with me and plough behind a buffalo. Yet that�s where you BEGIN the process of development, by doing it yourself.- Ray Wijewardene	With a vision and a missioHenry Ford once said �If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.�� People do not know what they really want till it is presented to them and it is for the visionary to come up with inventions capable of moving civilisation ahead.� The Ray Wijewardene Charitable Trust was established in January 2011 to promote the vision and ideas of the late Dr. Ray Wijewardene, an illustrious Sri Lankan engineer, inventor and specialist in tropical farming and renewable energy. This Trust recognises innovators and provides them with assistance to create cutting edge products and processes.By Sarasi Paranamanna and Dianne SilvaAlong the rough and long roadOvercoming many challenges, R.M.Dhammika Sujith Rathnayaka has come a long way as an inventor and a nominee for the Ray award and said such initiatives were vital for the� survival of inventors.He said he had decided to venture into this invention as many people were injured by coir machines.�The coir machine I made is a de fibre machine which is protective. It minimizes injuries in the de fibre process. Many have had to amputate their fingers while working on� these machines and I wanted to do something to minimise these injuries. This machine will be highly marketable because a similar project by� the Coconut Development Authority with an investment of Rs.16 million was not successful. However, I have successfully installed 12 machines so far� he said.He said his coir machine needed only� 4 skilled workers where as less efficient machines needed 12 workers. Although Dhammika had learnt his basics as a mechanic from technical institutes he had� been his own mentor and said he could get the basic idea about the functioning of any machine in about two or three hours. However he had� developed this process after years of rough experiences. He also said that the financing aspect in inventions was the most difficult task where little or no assistance is provided to inventors.�I started with the finances I had, but soon I had to take loans and had to repay by selling the vehicles and machines in my workshop. It is sad that the inventors in our country are not given due recognition. But if we can run or sing there are many sponsors. However, we are now recognised by programmes like the Ray Award,� he said.Dhammika has been acclaimed locally and internationally, having received the Presidential Award in 2007 and 2008, the World Intellectual Property Organisation Award in 2009, INNOMECH Award in 2009 and the Rajatha Sammanaya in 2009."" It is sad that the inventors in our country are not given due recognition """"Lightening"" the deadly force of natureLightning is a concern for many homeowners and businessmen and protection from this deadly force of nature is imperative. A young inventor from Meegoda had this desire to protect his father�s business from bolts of thunder and came up with his invention to avoid lightning related disasters.�I came up with this invention because my father who owned an ice-cream factory about half a mile from our home used to run to the factory as soon as rain and lightning started, to switch off the electrical equipment. Due to the nature of the production at the factory it was difficult to switch off the equipment and the freezers. This is what got me interested in finding a solution to this problem,� he said.He created a device consisting of three units, that could automatically sense lightning and safeguard equipment by isolation from the power lines. The sensor unit detects the radio emissions of lightning� known as �spherics�, monitoring lightning within as well as between clouds and predicting lightning well� before the charge build-up is high enough for a� ground stroke. Thereafter depending on the wave� pattern and other aspects, the logic unit will calculate the threat and decide whether to activate the� switching unit. This will isolate the load from the� mains supply during the danger period and revert� once it is over.To increase protection, the device features two isolation switches. A conventional surge diverter of� 100kA is connected to the circuit in between the� two isolating switches and another of 20kA is� connected to the load side of the second gap. As the average discharge current in the region is� around 30-35kA2 and the maximum observed is� around 55kA, this arrangement should provide� suf?cient safety to the load.As a young boy Mr. Nanayakkara had always been interested in electronics and said that his interest in pursuing an academic career in the field sparked during his Ordinary Level Exam. He credits his father, a meteorologist, for giving him the necessary backing and knowledge to pursue his dream.�My father knows a lot about lightning and its effects and he helped me, with my earlier research,� he said.At present Mr. Nanayakkara is reading for his PhD in lightning protection from the University of Colombo and hopes to perfect his invention. �I want to produce a faultless product, because at present there is a tendency to recognise man made radio waves as lightning and this issue needs to be cleared,� he said.He said,� if innovation was to thrive in Sri Lanka, businesses need to focus more on Research and Development instead of short term profits."" I want to produce a faultless product, because at present there is a tendency to recognise man made radio waves as lightning and this issue needs to be cleared ""Making ripples without wavesHis �waveless� boat earned him the 2012 Ray Award and his dream of� another design to pay tribute to Dr. Ray Wijewardene.The 2012 Ray award in memory of Dr. Ray Wijewardene is a lifetime award for innovation,� bagged by Indrasri Karunathilaka .�� This is a huge encouragement for me and other inventors in Sri Lanka. My next plan is to invent something with the dendro power (generation of electricity through biomass) as a tribute to Dr. Ray who is considered the father of dendro power,�� he said.Mr. Karunathilaka, a product of the Devamulla Junior School and the Horana Vidyarathna College has� won many awards including the Presidential award for the best design in 2007 and brought honour to Sri Lanka when he won the� International Silver prize at the Seoul International Invention Fair in 2009.However he said that Commercialisation in Sri Lanka has made it difficult for inventors, who find it difficult to finance their projects as even now,� state banks are not keen to provide loans to inventors.The invention that won him the Ray Award had also been financed� by his own funds. �At� the� request of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Mr. Karunathilaka has attempted to start a boat service in Nagadeepa but due to lack of finances the project is still pending.�Even though we contribute to the national economy the state banks are not keen about assisting inventors. They ask for security,� but not all inventors are well to do people It would be of help to inventors if the government could provide grants like other countries.� he said.He said water based transport was an alternate transport method in most countries and his invention was well received by countries like Venice, Thailand and Bangladesh,� who had offered� to purchase his product.His invention is a boat made of steel and aluminium that does not generate waves, is eco friendly as it does not contribute to river bank erosion and can be recycled. He had used anodic protection to reduce corrosion of the boat.�Most boats are made of fiberglass which is difficult to destroy and cannot be recycled. It is a burden to the environment and contributes to the spread of dengue. My invention is environmental friendly,� he said.Karunathilake said his� life itself had been an �experiment� because according to his parents� wishes he had studied to be a doctor,� fell short of marks to get into a medical faculty and had taken to accountancy. He says he never regrets his decision to change from a senior audit manager to be an inventor.�I was never a child who could keep my toys for long and used to break them more than I played with them because I was curious to put them back together.�I was� once injured while conducting an experiment� he reminisced.He had been the first Sri Lankan to attempt driving a car using LP Gas and in the early 1980s he had attempted to create a car which runs with LP gas using a home gas cylinder and was burnt during the process.Residing in his ancestral home in Horana,� situated near the bank of the Kalu ganga he says his invention could be used to promote the tourism industry in Sri Lanka.His next plan is to tap the export market as his waveless boat has much demand overseas.On Sunday he completed the design for a 12 foot boat, likely to travel at 100 Km per hour and transport around 6 persons. He hopes to market this at a low price under the name of Ray Wijewardene to show his gratitude for the recognition the award has brought him.��I was able to innovate something even better because the award got me the publicity and recognition I needed to tap into more sources of knowledge and expertise,� he said."" Even though we contribute to the national economy the state banks are not keen about assisting inventors. They ask for security,� but not all inventors are well to do people ""Green InventionEnvironmental sustainability is the need of the hour and any inventor today needs to recognise the importance of protecting natural resources.Sunil Gomes has been successful in brining together his� passion for the environment and his expertise in clean, efficient and cost effective production.He explains that while working as a consultant for the National Cleaner Production Centre he witnessed a number of minor flaws that could have been easily rectified with a little extra thought and effort. �We would visit hotels and factories and many other businesses and see that there was so much of waste in terms of raw material, energy and water. We make recommendations to ensure that these businesses are able to cut down on waste and become more profitable as well as environmentally sustainable,� he said.During many of his observational visits to rubber factories Gomes noticed that the latex collection methodology was extremely inefficient and has not changed in over 125 years. �There have been a number of advanced in the rubber manufacturing industry, from the smoked sheet to the final product, we have found so many ways to efficiently produce everyday products�however, the collection methods from the tree to the factory have not changed at all,� he said.In order to fill this void Gomes came up with an efficient and environmentally sound way of transporting latex. �In the usual process, latex undergoes at least seven transfers to different tanks and containers. This results in a large amount of latex going to waste. Labour and time is also wasted as the trucks have a waiting time during which these tanks� need to be cleared and cleaned,� he explained.His invention is a spherical container for latex, made of ?breglass, it is relatively lightweight and can easily be transported. After this container is ?lled at the rubber estate it can be transported directly without transferring the latex to and fro at the factory. At the same time, the two-way exit system attached to the bottom of the container can be connected directly to the� machines that will later process the latex."" There have been a number of advances in rubber manufacturing. However, the collection methods have not changed in 125 years ""A Surgeon with a causeDr. Shantha Lenadora a doctor who started out his career in the Navy as a Surgeon Lieutenant.Dr. Lenadora,� a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist has been involved in performing surgeries and realised the importance of a tissue friendly retractor.His invention is especially useful in prolonged and extensive surgeries. As he mentioned, the conventional self retaining retractors which helps to keep the tissues off the surgical field sometimes damage and traumatise tissues and in certain instances due to the extensive nature of the operation there is also the possibility of surgical injuries.His tissue friendly retractor utilises pneumatic pressure and acts like a shock absorber and does not damage the tissues.He said his invention is useful in extensive surgeries due to the length and width of the retractor and pneumatic cushioning facilities.�When the anaesthesia wears off the tissue pressure varies and when the hard surface of the normal steel retractor presses against the tissues they get damaged. But the normal disposable syringes I have used to accommodate the pneumatic pressure ensures that the tissues don�t get damaged� he explained.The retractor has been used for over a year in surgeries related to kidney transplants and gynaecologic surgeries and Dr. Lenadora said it has been a complete success. He has applied for a patent for his invention and the World Intellectual Property Organisation has said his retractor has not been designed by anyone in the world.� He has received the green light to obtain the patent. His invention has also won the Best Medical Invention in 2010 and the Presidential Award for the best invention. At the International Inventions Exhibtion held in Geneva in 2011 he won a gold medal for his retractor.�The Ray award is an opportunity for the inventors and also for the younger generation� he said."" Despite a childhood injury he is now a surgical innovator ""Providing an easier breath for asthmaticsThey say suffering is the birth of invention and this was certainly the case with Dr. Goonetilleke who suffered from Asthma for many years and in his adulthood came up with an improved inhaler which would better the lives of many children and adults who suffered from this repertory ailment.His �Ventohaler� is seen as an ordinary inhaler on the outside, however this improved device has a few key features that make it unique. The inhaler is designed in such a way that a cyclonic movement occurs within it when the patient inhales allowing for a larger deposit of medicine in the lungs. In addition the innovative mixing method of the drug is formulated in such a way that the micronized active drug particles are mixed with the larger �carrier� particles to ensure the smooth ?ow of the drug from the device. �Furthermore, a special �?ne� particle is added to reduce the adhesion between the active and carrier particles allowing the active drug particles to reach the lower lung while the carrier particles stop at the throat.Dr. Goonetilleke explains that he had three reasons for developing this inhaler;� �firstly I wanted to ensure that our patients received a high quality drug that was affordable, secondly I wanted some industrial growth in this country with Research and Development, instead of just importing everything from India,� he said. �However coming up with this system was no easy task and a true labour of love for the doctor. Over six years of extensive research has been spent on developing the Ventohaler and the medicinal tablets used in it. A further six years was spent in the process of mass manufacturing and� commercialising these products. �Today �Lina� Manufacturers� in partnership with Akbar Pharmaceuticals� (Pvt.) Ltd., manages a fully operational, state-of-the-art manufacturing plant constantly aspiring to meet the� medicinal needs of the one million plus asthma patients� in Sri Lanka.He says he is thankful to his wife who has seen him through the entire process of development as well as to Mr. Aski Akbarally for his continued support. He notes that the developing medicinal drugs in Sri Lanka is no easy task as there is no proper policy and support for developers. The lack of support results in local developers being at a disadvantage, having to compete face to face with Indian pharmacologists who have far more support.The Ventohaler (and the unique process by which it delivers medicine to the patient) has been patented in Sri Lanka and also won him the Presidential Award for Inventions in 2002 and 2008.""

Even domestic aides and others doing low-pay jobs were flaunting their mobile phones which now have snob value or give social status.While we commend Mr. Goonesekera for speaking out on such issues we also need to ask why he and other socialists like Ministers Tissa Witharana and Vasudeva Nanayakkara do not have the courage to resign on a matter of principle. The reason or excuse they give is that they could bring about some moderation or a middle-path policy by being within the Cabinet. If that excuse has any validity, they have miserably failed so far because the capitalist policies are continuing with wholesale corruption, fraud and blatant abuse of public funds turning the misery into a mess and a muddle.Not only mobile phones, we see unrestricted and unmonitored imports in so many other areas, so much so that the cost of imports is more than double what we earn from exports, and the country is facing a balance of payments crisis though the Government�s economic pundits are boasting or bluffing about high growth rates and per capita incomes.We wish to focus today on the unrestricted imports of food, so-called nutritional supplements and medicinal drugs. Sri Lanka is losing hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign exchange because of the lack of comprehensive and effective national food, nutrition and medicinal policies. Loads of the food we import are unnecessary or non-essential, while some items are unfit for human consumption. As for nutritional supplements, it was sad if not shameful to see the subtle promotion of such items at the recent annual sessions of one of Sri Lanka�s leading medical associations. While Sri Lanka�s dairy farmers are struggling to sell their fresh milk which has all the necessary nutrition at a low cost, the promotion of imported nutritional supplements tantamount to an act of child abuse. As for medicinal drugs, a homeopathic medicine has cured hundreds of people of the dreaded dengue. But the multi-million-dollar allopathic medical business continues to reject or scoff at it while more people are dying and hundreds are suffering.��",dengue

A to Z of tragedy,"2012-07-04 18:30:01							0						 				2030","By Vijitha HerathThe Supreme Court ruling on the Z-score and its repercussions created a number of controversies in the country for the past two weeks. Concerns were raised about the Z-scores issued for students who sat for the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination in 2011 as it was alleged that Z-scores issued were wrongly calculated. The situation arose when the authorities took steps to issue much delayed Advanced Level results following increasing demands by students and parents to do so.At that moment, four ministers and parliamentarians who are in charge of education came forward to thwart demands to rectify issued Z-scores. To make it easy to explain, it is important to note that not only Ministers S.B. Dissanayaka, Bandula Gunawardena and deputy minister Vijith Wijayamuni Soyza that came forward to suppress these demands, but also monitoring the MP who joined the government from the UNP to strengthen and uplift education in the country, Mohan Lal Grero.However, apart from these four, the� parents, teachers, lecturers�unions, intellectuals and all those who are connected to education stood by the stance that the Z-scores issued were incorrect. Even, Professor Thattil, who introduced the Z-score system to Sri Lanka, clearly maintained that it was incorrect to calculate a common Z-score for students who sat for the examination under two different syllabuses. What actually should have been done was to issue results after rectifying all those mistakes and if not to rectify already issued Z-score results setting aside the ego and pride of these ministers. Students should not have been allowed to take decisions based on the incorrect Z-scores issued. Yet, since the government was not ready to set its ego aside and rectify the matter, students and parents were compelled to go to courts and this in return delayed the process by another six months.Even though, six months could be considered unimportant when compared to the lifespan of an individual, this is the most important period for an A/L student who plans to re-sit the examination.Now, court has given a ruling which was requested by the students some six months ago and there is only one month left for this year�s Advanced Level examination. There is nothing or little left for the students who took decisions based on the previous results.Ironically, there is no one to take the responsibility for this blunder. The Education Ministry passes the ball to the Higher Education Ministry, which passes it to the University Grants Commission and then the latter passes the ball to some innocent lecturers. They do not have anyone to pass the ball on to and Education ministers are still holding media briefings to prove they do not have a blemish with regard to issued Z-scores.This is not limited to the education sector alone and is relevant to all important sectors; be it health, agriculture, irrigation or transportation. Today paddy fields are completely dried up without adequate water for cultivation and according to the Minister of Irrigation the fault is with the farmers. Dengue has reached epidemic levels and is spreading all over the country and the fault is with the public. No matter what goes wrong there is no one to be held accountable. There is hardly anybody to take the responsibility if any shortcoming took place in these fields. Yet, if an individual works singlehandedly to achieve something worthwhile there are more than enough people to take the credit for it. Despite the fact that it�s an achievement of a single individual, it belongs to the President who gave the concept or the �Chinthana�, to the minister who showed the path and to the advisors and consultants who monitored the project. Things that take place in the country in these fields and decisions taken could even challenge the rulings by King Kakille in the past.The unofficial message given from the top to the bottom of the government is that there is no need to be accountable for whatever the acts committed by one. Thugs sponsored by the government engaged in killings as if they were acting in action-thrillers; yet they are not being brought to book at all.�Even the institutions established to ensure law and order are taken into the grip of the government by a piece of legislature brought in the name of abolishing the 17th Amendment. Therefore, the message given by ministers that if one had a connection to the government that person would get away with any wrongdoing was wholeheartedly adopted by their henchmen and business community that dine together with these ministers. These clearly indicate the conditions of a social anarchy.� The beginning of the A to Z social collapse lies there.",dengue

Editorial - Death By Dengue,"2012-06-17 18:50:35							0						 				1829","No doubt, for a government it is always easy to seek public assistance to curb certain situations. Be it tracking down the perpetrators of a killing or netting the robbers who broke into the National Museum, the help of the public is amply sought.The same is true with the dengue epidemic prevailing in the country, which has compelled the government to prick the public in the eye with warnings and statistics. Perhaps, holding people accountable for issues of national importance may always do the trick. Yet, the question remains whether people�s vigilance alone can put things right. Does this also give people the power to hold the authorities accountable in return?It goes without saying that educating people and alerting them on glaring dangers are crucial for the wellbeing of the country. It is also important that their vigilance is directed along the right path in taking preventive measures against the spread of dengue. As the case stands, a weekend newspaper went on to report that a few government institutions have been contributing to the spread the disease by breeding �mosquitoes in their premises!Clearly, these are fences the public is not allowed to cross. �Another news report revealed that out of the 12 ministries that were armed with the duty of dengue eradication, only two have been properly fulfilling the task. At any rate, it should not be taken lightly that the rest of the ministries have been slacking and bluffing at the expense of people�s lives. Hence, the question as to why the higher authorities that monitor the work of these ministries allowed lethargy needs to be answered.14, 500 dengue patients and 80 deaths for the last five months are no forgivable numbers.Those who only worry about the good looks of Colombo need to pay more attention on the actual cleanliness and proper garbage disposal in the city. Allocating huge monies on decoration may serve little purpose if the heart of the city still houses mosquito-breeding places. Educating, urging and fining people �alone would not help keep dengue at bay if the authorities continue to show their sleepy-faces to the people for their own convenience. This lack of action on their part, automatically takes away their authority to instruct the public on preventive methods. Examples, whether bad or good, are intended to be followed when they are set by the state authorities. This however should not be the trend of dengue eradication in the country.It is commendable that the government has taken many initiatives to eradicate dengue islandwide. But, even a thousand such programmes might not do, if their progress is not closely monitored.Dengue eradication should not be seasonal. One should not wait till the hype builds up to clean one's backyard or office premises. Prevention, be it dengue or any other epidemic, should be constant; because, death is neither seasonal nor reversible.",dengue

Deportees from Togo to be checked for yellow fever,"2012-02-08 19:33:12							1						 				3769","The Health ministry yesterday alerted Medical Officers of Health (MOH) to locate the illegal immigrants who were recently deported from Togo and check them for symptoms of the dreaded yellow fever. 		The officers were asked to report immediately to the Government Epidemiology Unit (GEU) and Quarantine Unit (QU) if any of the deportees are found to suffer from the disease.		A Health Ministry spokesman said Ministry Secretary Dr. Ravindra Ruberu had issued the relevant circular so as to prevent a possible spread of the killer fever which was wide spread in Africa. 		A group of 28 Sri Lankan asylum seekers while attempting to illegally migrate to Canada via Togo in West Africa had been detained and deported to Sri Lanka on Monday. 		The 27 Tamils and one Muslim were from Jaffna, Batticaloa and Colombo. 		Health Services Deputy Director General Dr. Sarath Amunugama confirmed Health Ministry concerns.		�This is a pre-emptive measure taken by the Ministry as yellow fever is wide spread in Africa and we have information that several Sri Lankans deported from Togo had been suffering from yellow fever and later cured of the disease. 		Dr. Amunugama said the Sri Lankan branch of the International Organisation of Migration (IOM) had failed to alert the Health Ministry on the deportation and therefore the Ministry had to take steps to locate the deportees and check them for yellow fever.		�The Health Ministry could have tested the deportees for symptoms of yellow fever if the IOM had informed in advance about the arrival of these Sri Lankans. They have failed to do that and we are in a quandary by having to locate and check the members of the group,� he said. �We are especially worried that dengue mosquitoes are the carriers of the RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family that carries yellow fever at a time when dengue is also on the rise in the country.� 		Dr. Amunugama said the IOM was legally bound to give an alert on such deportation as it was the IOM that arranged the process with the cooperation of the Togo authorities. 		If found to be infected with the virus, the MOHs have been instructed to send the patient�s blood sample to the QU. The patient must also be brought to the Infectious Disease Hospital in Angoda and kept isolated.� 		Dr. Amunugama added that though curable, immediate medical attention was vital to prevent deaths. 		Yellow fever begins after an incubation period of three to six days. Most cases only cause a mild infection with fever, headache, chills, and back pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. 		In these cases the infection lasts only three to four days. In 15 per cent of cases, however, patients enter a second, toxic phase of the disease with recurring fever, this time accompanied either by jaundice due to liver damage and abdominal pain.		Bleeding from the mouth, the eyes and in the gastrointestinal tract will cause vomit laced with blood. The toxic phase is fatal in approximately 20 per cent of cases, making the overall fatality rate for the disease three per cent. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)",dengue

Mosquito species like Aedes aegypti linnaeus carry the yellow fever virus which is a haemorrhagic disease,� Government Epidemiology Unit (GEU) Director Dr. Prabha Palihawadana said.She said the yellow fever virus was transmitted by the bite of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti and other species and was found in tropical and subtropical areas in South America and Africa.Symptoms of Yellow fever include fever, nausea and pain and generally subside after several days. In some patients, a toxic phase follows in which liver damage and jaundice can occur and lead to death. Dr. Palihawadana said because of the increased bleeding yellow fever belongs to the group of haemorrhagic fever. Since no therapy is known, vaccination programmes along with measures to reduce the mosquito population was of great importance. The quarantine unit will check all air passengers arriving from American and African countries at the BIA to check whether they had been infected with the virus and if so they will be isolated and treated in a special ward exclusively set up at the Colombo North Teaching Hospital. The yellow fever virus spreads only through dengue mosquitoes. Meanwhile, a Ministry spokesman said Minister Sirisena had instructed officials to prepare a programme to prevent yellow fever entering the country and remedial measures that have to be taken when someone with yellow fever entered the country.Ministry spokesman W. M. D. Wanninayaka said Minister Sirisena has directed the Colombo National Hospital and hospitals in the Colombo suburbs to be equipped with drugs and medical equipment needed to treat yellow fever.

A study conducted by the Dengue Control Programme has revealed that many occupants of housing schemes in the city have constructed unauthorized buildings blocking the drains and thereby creating mosquito breeding grounds, Ministry spokesman W.M.D.Wanninayaka said.		The study has also found that certain vegetable and flower plants have blocked gutters and drain piles enabling rain water to block and stagnate thereby creating ideal breeding places for mosquitoes, he said.	� 	Minister Sirisena expects to submit a report to the cabinet about the difficulty to control dengue without public participation and their assistance. In the Colombo city alone there are thousands of slums concentrated in a small land where dengue control and access by health officials are extremely difficult.

Panadol Sahana Balakaya Helps Colombo Battle  Deadly Dengue Outbreak,"2010-10-25 06:07:12							0						 				4822","The 2010 'Panadol Sahana Balakaya' a two week long, clean up drive of the city of Colombo that involved members of Rotary District 3220 - Sri Lanka, Rotarians, Rotaractors, Interactors, Police, Corporate and other volunteers, in addition to children drawn from 143 schools in Colombo, who joined hands with local Public Health Inspectors and Municipal Health Workers of the Municipal Council of Colombo, recently concluded its first phase of activity. Official data indicated the number of confirmed cases in July 2010, when the 'Panadol Sahana Balakaya' came into action, was 434 and the number of cases for the month of August was declared at 260 (a reduction of 67%). The Panadol Sahana Balakaya is thus proud to have played a part in the obtaining these results. The approach that defined the uniqueness of the 'Panadol Sahana Balakaya,' was that in addition to house-to-house visits that covered all 47 wards in the city of Colombo, the 'Panadol Sahana Balakaya' also engaged in a mindset change of Colombo residents via grassroots education on the causes of Dengue and the breeding habits of this mosquito.The 'Panadol Sahana Balakaya' was also ably assisted by an informative television ad campaign sponsored by Panadol -� a brand of Paracetamol - that highlighted, the link between careless waste disposal in the home and how Dengue breeding grounds are created. The commercial, in order to transmit the urgency and seriousness of the issue, utilized graphic visuals, in order to drive home the message that the first step in eradicating Dengue, was in the home.In addition to the distribution of leaflets and educational activities (conversations), the 'Panadol Sahana Balakaya' also focused their attention on flat roofs, poorly maintained gutters, water containers, unkempt gardens, tree holes, construction sites and abandoned lands, that all played host to this deadly infliction.Chief Medical Officer of the Colombo Municipality, Dr. Pradeep Kariyawasam commenting on the results said, ""The density of mosquitoes in the Colombo Municipal Area has dropped significantly, complemented by also a reduction in the number of Dengue cases. The efforts of this force in also teaching Colombo residents on effective and healthy household environment management practices, is also a commendable action in ensuring the 'Panadol Sahana Balakaya' was an effective partner in contributing to these results.""Sachi Thomas, Managing Director of GSK Consumer Healthcare - Sri Lanka commenting on the latest results said, ""Panadol is happy to have partnered with the members of Rotary District 3220 - Sri Lanka, alongside a host of volunteers, in order to make a significant contribution in aiding the mindset/ perception change of Colombo residents as to the consequences of this deadly disease. It is my sincere hope that Colombo residents are now more aware of the nature of Dengue and support all stakeholders involved, especially the Colombo Municipality. As the monsoon prepares to lash the city of Colombo again, a concerted multi-party effort by the public, private entities and the state is required in order further cement the results achieved thus far.""",dengue

However, that is the past. Soon, we may have another opportunity to continue that journey of progress. We have engaged in continuous dialogue with religious leaders and the elders of the Muslim community and will continue to discuss the issues that trouble you, the fears that you have and the measures that can be taken to resolve them,� Mr. Rajapaksa said.He said the intention of the Rajapaksa Government was always to create a nation where Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils and people from every community in this country can get on with their lives, knowing that they are safe. �If we can all come together once again, I am sure we will be able to achieve this.

Holding election on time vital to protect democracy: Deshapriya,"2018-06-10 23:12:08							6						 				3502","Holding elections on time is vital to protect democracy, franchise and people�s sovereignty in a country and delay in holding elections had resulted in destruction, the Chairman of Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya said.He stressed the importance of election at a seminar under the theme �True democracy depends on the right to vote� held to mark �Voters� Day� by the Anuradhapura District Secretariat and Anuradhapura Regional Elections Offices on Friday.The Elections Chief said that there had been three corrupt elections held in our country at times there was no ban imposed by any group of voters to go to the polling stations. One of these was the North Western PC election held in 1999, the other two were referendum of 1982, Jaffna District Development Council (DDC) Election held in 1981.In the Jaffna district council elections, he recalled, outsiders from Colombo and Kurunegala without having rights to engage in duties at polling stations were deployed leading to disappearance of ballot boxes. Later some of them were found. And this incident was followed by an arson attack on the Jaffna Library in the night of the same day.This incident also breached the confidence of moderate Tamil politicians on elections and paved the way for ""bullet instead of ballot� he pointed out.Some see the riots in 1983 as the fuelling factor that strengthened the armed groups in the North. It is true but I consider 1981 DDC election as the point of emergence for these groups, Mr Deshapriya stated.Reminiscing another landmark in the country's election history, the Elections Commission Chairman said on the basis of the number of votes polled by the political party represented by youth in the 1982 presidential election there was a possibility of securing five to ten seats by them if a general election that was to be held in 1983.""But youth were deprived of this opportunity leaving them in a breached confidence in the election. This situation pushed some of them to take to arms. About 60,000 lives were perished in the uprising that followed, he recalled.Thus inappropriate elections and postponing elections bring death and destruction, he asserted.He said through the 1972 Constitution the five-year term of the then government was extended to six-year term and the then leader of the opposition J.R. Jayewardene resigned from his parliamentary seat and faced fresh polls setting an example for the politicians.It is the duty of all the 225 members in Parliament to help holding of elections to North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern PCs to give an opportunity to the voters to express their views, Mr. Deshpariya stressed.

Will donate Aloysius money to charity: Sujeewa,"2018-06-08 19:15:01							139						 				19541","State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe, who was accused of receiving monies from the W.M.

When I first heard of these cheques I was shocked for several minutes. Then I realised that had to face it. I did politics with Principals and I know that I have not conducted anything illegal.

He was 61.CNN confirmed Bourdain's death on Friday and said the cause of death was suicide.""It is with extraordinary sadness we can confirm the death of our friend and colleague, Anthony Bourdain,"" the network said in a statement Friday morning. ""His love of great adventure, new friends, fine food and drink and the remarkable stories of the world made him a unique storyteller. His talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time.""Bourdain was in France working on an upcoming episode of his award-winning CNN series ""Parts Unknown."" His close friend Eric Ripert, the French chef, found Bourdain unresponsive in his hotel room Friday morning.""Tony was an exceptional talent,"" CNN President Jeff Zucker said in an email to employees. ""Tony will be greatly missed not only for his work but also for the passion with which he did it.""Bourdain was a master of his crafts -- first in the kitchen and then in the media. Through his TV shows and books, he explored the human condition and helped audiences think differently about food, travel and themselves. He advocated for marginalized populations and campaigned for safer working conditions for restaurant staffs.Along the way, he received practically every award the industry has to offer.In 2013, Peabody Award judges honored Bourdain and ""Parts Unknown"" for ""expanding our palates and horizons in equal measure.""""He's irreverent, honest, curious, never condescending, never obsequious,"" the judges said. ""People open up to him and, in doing so, often reveal more about their hometowns or homelands than a traditional reporter could hope to document.""The Smithsonian once called him ""the original rock star"" of the culinary world, ""the Elvis of bad boy chefs.""In 1999 he wrote a New Yorker article, ""Don't Eat Before Reading This,"" that became a best-selling book in 2000, ""Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly.The book set him on a path to international stardom.First he hosted ""A Cook's Tour"" on the Food Network, then moved to ""Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations"" on the Travel Channel. ""No Reservations"" was a breakout hit, earning two Emmy Awards and more than a dozen nominations.In 2013 both Bourdain and CNN took a risk by bringing him to the news network still best known for breaking news and headlines. Bourdain quickly became one of the principal faces of the network and one of the linchpins of the prime time schedule.Season 11 of ""Parts Unknown"" premiered on CNN last month.While accepting the Peabody award in 2013, Bourdain described how he approached his work.""We ask very simple questions: What makes you happy? What do you eat? What do you like to cook? And everywhere in the world we go and ask these very simple questions,"" he said, ""we tend to get some really astonishing answers.""Bourdain's death happened after fashion designer Kate Spade hanged herself in an apparent suicide at her Manhattan apartment on Tuesday.Suicide is a growing problem in the United States. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a survey Thursday showing suicide rates increased by 25% across the United States over nearly two decades ending in 2016.

Tendulkar's son to play against Sri Lanka,"2018-06-08 09:10:12							14						 				13118","Arjun Tendulkar, son of the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, was named in the India under-19 squad that�ll tour Sri Lanka next month. India are due to play two four-day and five one-day matches against the island nation. However, Arjun has only been picked to feature in the two four-day ties.Delhi�s Anuj Rawat will lead the side in the four-day format while Aryan Juyal has been named skipper for the limited-overs ties. Arjun, who is 18 years old, was part of the under-19 camp held in Dharamsala last week. Unlike his father, Arjun falls more in the bracket of a bowling all-rounder. He had taken a four-for and slammed a 27-ball 48 earlier this year while participating in the Spirit of Cricket Global Challenge in Australia.Arjun has also represented Mumbai in the under-14 and under-16 formats. In the Cooch Behar Trophy last season, Arjun had played in five of the six games and taken 18 wickets in the tournament, including two five-fors and a four-wicket haul. He, however, had a poor return with the bat, scoring just 94 runs in five innings at an average of 18.80.Arjun is one of the most-followed junior cricketers owing to his father�s stature, which also attracts extra scrutiny and dealing with massive amounts of pressure. Ever since his teenage days, comparisons have been drawn between the father-son duo which had even prompted the former Indian skipper to step in and urge his son to be left alone.Last year, Arjun was seen bowling at the India nets during the home series against New Zealand in Mumbai while a toe-crushing yorker that he sent down to Jonny Bairstow in the nets in England, had left the latter with an injury scare. However, he�s yet to make a mark of his own and would want to use the under-19 opportunity to good use.Earlier this year, Arjun had opted out of the Mumbai T20 league since he wanted to remodel his bowling action which he felt wasn�t ready for competitive tournaments. According to several reports, his father, who was also the brand ambassador of the league, was learnt to have guided him to take the decision.(Hindustan Times)",non-dengue

Many of them have recourse to unlimited resources. Thus we cannot be very open with all the strategies we intend pursuing. We cannot liberally distribute the restructuring plan, in our own interests"".��Full letter�Message from the Chairman to all members of the Staff,Dear Friends,�A new Board of Directors at the helm of your airline, with the undersigned as its Chairman, has been in office for approximately, the past two months. During this period I have tried to meet, as many of you as possible,� in the different locations, in order to explain the perilous� financial position� the airline is in, and what we can and intend doing to restore viability. Despite that effort, I do realize that I have not been able to meet a large section of the staff yet, and will not be able to do so, soon enough, given the other pressing issues that needs my attention. Hence the need to address all of you in this manner.��Despite the fact that we now have an excellent Board comprising of committed professionals, that alone will not bring about a change in the fortunes of the airline. A return to profitability can only be brought about by all three parties who constitute the airline viz the Owner(the Government), the Board of Directors and the Management and Staff, decide to� work tirelessly and in unison, to make that happen.� �The Government as the owner is fully behind the restructuring, and is extremely supportive of this effort. It is my firm belief that the Government will not interfere with the day to day operations of the airline. On the contrary they will extend their fullest cooperation and support as they have willingly done, in the recent past. The Board on its part is fully committed to giving leadership to this effort. They have demonstrated that commitment by voluntarily agreeing not to receive any remuneration from the airline or enjoy any of the perks enjoyed by Directors in the past, till the airline becomes profitable once more. I expect that same commitment from all members of the staff. This is our National carrier. It is the carrier that flies our country�s flag to the rest of the world. It is our duty to protect it, develop it and make it profitable. We have something called pride within all of us. We do not want our airline to be a financial burden on the people of this country, year after year.��All my predecessors in office, past Boards of Directors, and all Management personnel who provided leadership, I presume, have made sincere efforts to restore viability to the airline. But we have been unsuccessful in that effort. Thus quite rightly, the Government as the owner, has sought and obtained the guidance and advice of external Consultants to assist us in that effort. This has been done prior to the new Board assuming office. However I have since discovered that the selection of the consultants has been done in a very transparent manner via public invitations for proposals. I have interacted with the consultants since assuming office and I find them very competent and committed. They comprise of individuals who have extensive experience in the different disciplines within the airline industry. As a firm they have in the recent past, successfully helped turnaround several large and reputed airlines.��But that does not imply that we are bound or obliged to implement all recommendations made by the consultants. The restructuring plan we hope to implement, is not one that is thrust on us by the Government or the Consultants. It will be a plan that we adopt. A plan we believe in. During the past� two months our senior staff have been reviewing the plan together with the consultants in order to gain� sufficient confidence that the plan is good for the airline, that it is practical and has taken into account our fears and concerns. Having done that, we have now arrived at an agreed set of proposals. What is now left is for us to implement the plan diligently and in a timely manner.��In doing so you have an important role to play. The trade unions and other collective bodies have a role to play. In the first place you must have an understanding of the current state of affairs of the airline and the broad initiatives we intend taking. How we expect things to change? What changes we have to bring about? What sacrifices we have to make? We cannot continue with the status quo and at the same time restore profitability. We are seriously out of line with the norms in the industry.� �I intend organizing a briefing session by the consultants for the benefit of the leaders of all trade unions and associations. You will realize that we operate in a very competitive Global industry. We compete with some of the best airlines in the world. Many of them have recourse to unlimited resources. Thus we cannot be very open with all the strategies we intend pursuing. We cannot liberally distribute the restructuring plan, in our own interests. However we shall brief you adequately on the restructuring plan.��Despite this communique being lengthy, I must refer to one more matter which is critical. It needs only a moments reflection for all of you to realize that the most important decision any Board makes is the appointment of the CEO of the Company and the Senior Management team. It is the CEO and his team that is responsible for conducting the day to day affairs of the company. However good a plan may be, the results derived from it, will depend on how it is implemented.� It is the passion that the top team displays, that will invigorate and energize the rest of the staff. The Board intends to make some changes in the composition of the top management team. The current CEO has agreed to take an early retirement. There will be a new Chief for the Commercial division.�Our fully owned subsidiary, the catering Company, is led by a part time CEO. That Company, is a jewel in the crown of the group, in terms of profitability. It requires a full time CEO and our present CF&AO who has been overseeing its operations will move over there, as its full time CEO. We have already engaged a new CFO, who will assume office shortly.� There will also be some minor reallocation of responsibilities in the organizational structure.��A final word on the dynamics of CHANGE. Change is always traumatic. All of us today, are in what change management �specialists� would call the �Neutral Zone�. The neutral zone is a �No man�s land between the old and the new�. It is the night during which we are disengaged from yesterday�s concerns and prepare for the tomorrows. It represents the chaos in which the old form of things dissolves and from which the new form emerges.��This is a stage where each one of you can play an active role, by for instance, identifying what needs to be changed, proposing better and more efficient ways of doing things, identifying new revenue opportunities, cutting down costs, eliminating waste etc. I am certain that if we all give of our best and work together, we will not only restore profitability but be recognized as one of the best airlines in this region, in the short to medium term.� ��Yours Sincerely,� �Ranjit Fernando�Chairman",non-dengue

They need more Sinhala resources"", said the island's telecommunications minister Harin Fernando.Since the violence broke out in March, two high-level delegations from the company have visited Sri Lanka, where ethnic divisions linger after decades of war, to assure the government of its intent.Ahuja said Facebook was working with civil society organisations to familiarise its staff with Sinhala slurs and racist epithets.Complex local nuances have added to the challenge. The word for ""brother"" in Tamil - also an official language in the country - can be a derogatory term in Sinhala when a slight inflection is used.Ahuja said Facebook has since taken down ""hate figures and organisations"" in Sri Lanka including the Bodu Bala Sena, a radical Buddhist outfit that is blamed for attacks against Muslims in recent years.",non-dengue

It was against this background that the President and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe agreed to the 100-day programme.Responding to journalists at yesterday�s Cabinet news briefing, the minister said the joint opposition was in disarray and the splits within the JO and SLPP were getting worse by the day.Journalist:There are media reports that the cracks are kept widening within the JO and SLPP. Are you happy as a front-liner of the yahapalana government?Minister:Not really.

Where and when is this going to end?Minister:Don�t worry. The yahapalana government is as strong as ever. The differences and arguments are common in any coalition. You may remember that the coalition governments under Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956 and Madam Bandaranaike in 1960 faced more serious problems. The splits in 50s ultimately led to the assassination of Mr. Bandaranike.

Your comments?Minister:That victory reflects the true political situation in the country and whom the people are with. The parliamentary tradition in Sri Lanka up to now is to elect the Speaker and the Deputy from the government side and chairman of committees by the opposition. When the deputy speakers� post fell vacant, the SLFP proposed its Jaffna district MP Angajan Ramanathan for the post but the TNA opposed. Then after the Prime Minister proposed the name of Ananda Kumarasiri for the post and President Sirisena proposed Sudharshini Fernandopulle�s name. But Mr. Wickremesinge said the UNP had already proposed Mr. Kumarasiri�s name and therefore the UNP could not support Dr. Fernandopulle.

We were out from the first round. We lost badly in some matches... and people were also saying at that time 'don't know whether this man has thrown the match',� Sumathipala said.Sumathipala and Ranatunga are political arch-rivals. Ranatunga's brother Nishantha is standing against Sumathipala for the board presidency and a court on Wednesday suspended the vote.Corruption allegations are regularly part of their fight.Local media had raised suspicions of Sri Lankans throwing the 2011 final, but there was no formal call for an investigation until Ranatunga made an outburst last year which he repeated on Wednesday.Sumathipala said Ranatunga was suggesting that 2011 captain Kumar Sangakkara, who is affectionately known as Sanga, and his deputy Mahela Jayawardene had thrown the match.�Why is he (Ranatunga) trying to drag them into this seven years after the match,� Sumathipala said. �We are implying that Sanga and Mahela have thrown the match.� �It's not fair. Sanga and Mahela have done so much for world cricket and they are respectable people in the eyes of the public.� Sri Lanka scored 274-6 and appeared in a commanding position when Indian superstar Sachin Tendulkar was caught for 18. But India turned the game dramatically, thanks partly to poor fielding and bowling by Sri Lanka.Ranatunga also said in his latest outburst that corruption in Sri Lankan cricket �goes right to the top�.The country is again at the centre of allegations made in an Al-Jazeera documentary last weekend.�I deny any involvement... Nobody in the executive committee or the management of this board is up to mischief or any malpractice,� Sumathipala said.The board has suspended three employees implicated by the documentary, which alleged that a Sri Lankan player and groundsman were involved a pitch-tampering plot.In 2016, the International Cricket Council imposed a three-year ban on a Sri Lankan official, Jayananda Warnaweera, for failing to cooperate with an anti-corruption investigation.

Those law enforcement authorities must act promptly to put an end to crimes and the underworld thuggery without any concern on the time taken to do that. If the government realizes that those establishments are weak and incompetent to take action against the underworld operatives, I have no option but to appoint someone else to do the job properly,� he stressed.President Sirisena added that it was incomprehensible and surprising as to how the underworld thugs flee the country after committing serious crimes despite the fact that all boarder points, the police, the CID and BIA had been fed with comprehensive information on underworld criminals and of their families.�I admit that there has been a steep rise of crimes committed involving the underworld criminals. Particulars of each and every criminal, his/her families, Passports numbers and other travel documents details and all other information have been fed in to computer network of law enforcement authorities and the airport.What I cannot understand is that how these criminals manage to flee the country after committing a crime. Don�t these establishments have a list of criminals in their computer system? After they had left the country, the media raise cries that criminals or the underworld operatives had fled,� President Sirisena lamented. (Sandun A. Jayasekara)",non-dengue
Abolish PTA without compromising national security: HRCSL,"2018-06-01 04:13:04							3						 				2997","The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) should be abolished in order to prevent violations of citizen�s human rights without posing any threat to national security, Chairperson of Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) Dr. Deepika Udugama said yesterday.She said that it was the Commission�s preliminary recommendation to the government to abolish the PTA Act, since it was observed that the human rights were heavily violated via the Act throughout the past decades.�It does not mean that we should not take adequate laws and regulations for the sake of the national security. But such rules should be drafted in accordance with to protect the human rights. Soon after the new office bearers were appointed, we made recommendations for the subjects including PTA, death penalty, hate speech and establishing of the Office on Missing Persons.� she said.Dr. Udugama said instead of the Commission�s duties to inquire into the complaints which had been received, it is also the Commission�s duty to advise the government on how to draft rules and regulations on protecting human rights.She further said that National Security Act is being drafted and it is very important that HRCSL must study it before it was passed in Parliament.�The biggest challenge we face is that we do not receive the Draft Bills to study whether those rules and regulations were drafted properly. These are essential to people�s lives. We have requested the President, the Prime Minister and the relevant ministries to handover the Draft Bills before passing it.""There is no judicial review of legislation in Sri Lanka unlike in our neighbouring countries like India. So this is why it is absolutely important that the HRCSL gets to study the Draft Bill so that we can abide the Government in compliance with human rights,� she added.

Will ban social media if they don�t self-regulate: MS,"2018-06-01 02:32:45							44						 				24400","President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday he had discussed with a US based global institution regarding the issues that had arisen in the country due to social media and that if they were unable to control such issues, he would have to ban social media websites altogether like� some other countries had done.�I summoned a team of experts who work in a global institution in the US that attend to issues pertaining to social media. I discussed with them the influence of the social media has on social and national security, ethnic harmony, integrity of a family and so on because social media has influenced them badly. I also told the US experts that if they could not control what was going on in Sri Lanka, I would take steps to control misusing of social media notwithstanding whoever opposed,� he said.He added that many other countries had prohibited social media that had resorted to illegal and anti-national acts in this manner.�We have no issue with web sites as to who does the correct thing and provides good entertainment to the people and useful education to children,� he said.Addressing a ceremony held yesterday to mark the opening of the new Courts Complex at Welisara, President Sirisena went on to say that the acts of crimes had increased with the advent of modern technology. The crimes which are being committed using computer, smartphones and social media network are on the rise.There were protests when I took measures to block social media websites during the recent ethnic unrest took place in Kandy. But subsequently, there were accolades and gratitude for actions taken to curb social media platforms.The IGP gave me a report upon my request on crimes induced by on line websites or social media. When I went through the report, I had goosebumps. Police officers told me that only 10% of crimes committed using modern technology is reported.There were instances in the recent past where social media was used to influence Judges before the verdicts were delivered. Various fabricated allegations were levelled against Judges. These kinds of malicious campaigns had made the Judges distressed and perturbed. As politicians, we are used to mudslinging but not are the Judges.A President is a politician. It is extremely inappropriate if a Magistrate or Chief Justice going behind politicians. I make nominations to the Constitutional Council (CC) only the list of names is sent to me by the Chief Justice. He sends me the names after consulting the Judicial Service Commission. There are instances where I consult the Attorney General when there were issues pertaining to nomination of judicial officers to the CC. Sometimes, High Court Judges complain to me on transfers and promotions given to junior ranked Judges over more experienced ones. They also say at times that it was difficult for them to go to the CJ or the JSC to air their grievances. That is why I ask the CJ and AG to create a system to address the grievances of judicial officers.I was not elected as the Executive President after serving as Prime Minister like all the other Presidents in the past. The people in this country did not give me a mandate on January 8, 2015 not to get jobs but to restore law and order, democracy and independence of judiciary and press. I believe I have fulfilled two out of the three pledges. I have restored the rule of law, strengthened democratic institutions and created a free judiciary and media in the last three years.President Sirisena said he was one of the most affected victims of social media mudslinging campaigns and said had these kinds of acts been committed during the previous regime, he or she would not have survived much longer.�There are incidences of character assassinations, mudslinging and tarnishing people's image using social media. I am one of the most affected victims of social media mudslinging campaigns. If this kind of acts committed during the previous regime, he or she would not have survived much longer. Within days they would have been wiped out. But we don�t do this kind of acts and the social or main stream media enjoy the freedom enjoyed by them under this government to the fullest and sling as much mud at us maliciously and in most cruelest ways dishing out fabrications, misinterpretations, character assassinations, half-baked truths and absolute lies,� he emphasized.(Sandun A.

The effects of previous borrowing will be felt more severely in the time to come. More than 75% of government debt servicing during 2019-2022 will be due to maturing or bunching of debt obtained prior to 2015,� he said.Minister Samaraweera said the 'Enterprise Sri Lanka loan schemes� will be ceremonially launched by the President and the Prime Minister at the BMICH�on June�22.�These schemes will target the most productive investment sectors. It is private enterprise that is created and expanded through these programmes which will drive Sri Lanka�s future growth. In addition to the revival of private investment driven by Enterprise Sri Lanka, it is necessary for the state to invest directly in the rural economy. Towards this end, the government will also be introducing the rapid rural infrastructure investment scheme, GAMPERALIYA. This includes the rehabilitation of over 22,000 rural tanks which will have a major impact on agricultural productivity and agricultural incomes that have suffered during the previous droughts,� he said. �",non-dengue

Sobitha Thera didn�t ask common candidate to break banks,"2018-05-30 20:45:27							35						 				17526","President Maithripala Sirisena said today the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, who came forward to set up a Government through a common candidate, never asked a common candidate to loot the Central Bank.The President expressed these views at the 76th commemoration of the late Ven. Sobitha Thera held at Foundation Institute in Colombo.President Sirisena, who paid a surprise visit to the event, said he had not received an official invitation to attend the event. The President had this to say-:�I had not received an official invitation to attend the event. I came to know about it through a third party. My media director said the event was organized by Ravi Jayawardene. I contacted him and asked about my omission. He said there had been a mistake. Everyone had hoped I would be invited but no one took the initiative to do so.Some say the government went wrong after I took up the chairmanship of the SLFP. I can explain to you what actually happened and who ruined the vision of the Ven. Sobitha Thera.I brought today�s Daily Mirror newspaper along with me. It has posted a photo of me and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad saying that I have not done what he has done in five days. It says Malaysian Prime Minister has arrested nine ministers, 144 businessmen and 50 judges accused of corruption. I phoned Malaysia and our High Commissioner in Malaysia and they said these claims are all false. Social media also critisised me me in the last few days saying I have not done what Mahathir took five days to accomplish.I am a person who came forward to make this country better and carry out the principles of good governance in its true sense. I could have earned huge sums of money when I was the Health Minister if I wanted to. I am truly hurt by the wrong interpretations that has been formed in the minds of the public about me. I am taken aback when I hear things such as the fact that cases against wrongdoers are not being taken up because of me. People never expected an investigation to be launched into allegations that former Minister T.B. Ekanayake gave a vehicle to someone, former Deputy Minister Priyankara Jayaratne giving a job to his daughter and former Minister A.H.M. Fowzie misusing a vehicle belonging to another ministry.People in this country did not expect such behaviour from their public representatives. If family members of murdered rugby player Wasim Thajudeen and lawyers appeared in his case were taken to one place and asked, they would reveal what had happened.We must see why I could not carry out most of what people expected me to do after electing me the President. I had not experienced insults, character assassination and disgrace in my 47-year-old political career than I experienced as the President. As former President Ranasinghe Premadasa had said, I am someone who is well-tempered with politics.Some people say if anyone contested the Presidential Election as the common candidate could have won. If so they could have done so. I was used as the common candidate as I was a clean politician and came forward as a lion despite life threats.After I was sworn in as the President on January 9, Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the Prime Minister. However, the UNP had only 47 seats in Parliament then. How can a Government be formed with only 47 seats?These people came up with a One-hundred-day Programme, which didn�t include a dissolving of Government. If that programme was not in place, the main task available was to dissolve Parliament. The one-hundred-day programme was one of the silliest things ever undertaken by this government.Had I not accepted the chairmanship of the SLFP, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake of the group of 47 MPs would have failed to pass the budget in Parliament.�Who provided helicopters to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to go to Tangalle unharmed after the Presidential election results were announced? Was it me? No! It was so and so. (Ariyaratna Ranabahu)Video by Sepala",non-dengue
International community cannot be spectator if Govt. failed: Sampanthan,"2018-05-30 20:18:34							12						 				4165","While claiming that the International community could not be a spectator anymore with regard to Sri Lanka, Leader of the Opposition and the Tamil National Alliance R. Sampanthan said today if the Government continued to fail in its commitments, the International Community must clearly state its position on follow up mechanisms to safeguard the victims and ensure non-recurrence of the past.He told this during a meeting with the visiting United States House of Representatives Armed Services Committee Delegation led by McClellan Thornberry in Colombo today.Mr Sampanthan urged the delegation that the role of the International Community with regard to Sri Lanka must be defined in relation to the UNHRC recommendations and that the International Community must ensure that the promises and the commitments given by the Sri Lankan Government were adhered to and implemented.He briefed the delegation on the current political situation in the country and emphasized the importance of both President and Prime Minister working together in order to find solutions to fundamental issues and taking this country forward.�We are unhappy about the way the country is progressing,� Mr Sampanthan told the delegation.Answering a question Sampanthan said, that �the majority of the people in this country were willing to address the national issue once and for all.�What is lacking is that the courage from the Sinhala leaders to go out to the people and explicitly tell them on the need for a new Constitution and the benefits of framing a new Constitution,� he said.�Some Sinhala political leaders are trying to satisfy the hardliners than being just and equal to all people in this country, they cannot go on this path forever, it will only end up in history being repeated,� Sampanthan said.�Especially the President and the Prime Minister must go to the Sinhala people and genuinely explain the need for a new Constitution. Since 1988 every successive Government and President have made several attempts to change the present Constitution, therefore, this should not be a difficult task for the majority of Sinhala people to understand,� he added.He said that they wanted a solution within a United, Undivided and Indivisible Country and added that the power-sharing arrangements should be in accordance with the international covenant on Civil and Political Rights, International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Expressing his concerns on the stalled process of drafting a new Constitution Sampanthan said that a new Constitution would pave the way to solve many issues that this country has faced including the heavy debt and economic prosperity, and therefore this effort cannot be abandoned.He said that the legitimate demands of the Tamil people in finding a lasting solution to the national question could only be addressed through adopting a new Constitution.Sampanthan highlighted that his party was confident that if the Constitution were passed in Parliament with a two-thirds majority it would be approved by the people at a referendum, which was necessary for a new Constitution.�We may have to rethink and our people will be forced to rethink our position if things do not go well and if things are not achieved within a certain timeframe,� he said.�The Government of Sri Lanka has given a Commitment to fully implement the UNHRC resolution adopted in 2015 before March 2019. It must fast-track the process to achieve those commitments,� he told the delegation.",non-dengue

National archives, libraries and documentation centres are places of memories,"" he added.Varadakumar also claims that Indian authorities had seized documents that belonged to the Tamil Information Centre back in 1987.""The Tamil Information Centre had two branches, one in Madras and one in Madurai from 1984 until 1987. The Indian authorities asked us to close them down saying that a peace accord has been signed between the government of Sri Lanka and India and they would help us transport the materials to Trincomalee and set up an archive there, which did not happen,"" claimed Varadakumar, a Tamil from northern Sri Lanka based in London.The centre fears that the destruction of FCO files adds to the loss of information, which dates back to the burning of the Jaffna Library by the Sri Lankan army in 1981, which housed palm-leaf manuscripts and ancient documents, and the destruction of the Jaffna Museum in 1989.The FCO kept a list of file titles, showing that the destroyed papers would have covered a range of important subjects, from security cooperation and arms sales, to foreign aid and requests for political asylum in the UK.An FCO spokesperson said: ""The FCO, as with all government departments, reviews all its files in line with the requirements of the Public Records Act before making a decision on permanent preservation.""The FCO's recommendations for the preservation or destruction of records take place under the guidance and supervision of the National Archives.

Because, we want Sri Lanka to succeed and the government is taking steps, there are certainly many more steps that need to be taken, but it should be a Sri Lankan led and a Sri Lankan driven process that I am confident would lead to healing and a brighter future,� he said at the interview.When asked about his views on repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), the ambassador said, the PTA was something that not only the US but other like-minded partners and the Sri Lankan government, had committed to through the UN process.�We do think that as Sri Lanka gets into a post-war phase and while strengthening its democracy, it is up to Sri Lanka to move along these things that it is committed to do.

Our companies make sure that they do not engage in any untoward activity and when they look around the world with all of the money that they have to expand their operations to mutually profitable expansions, they look for business ecosystems that are high trust, very clear rules, quick arbitration and impartial arbitration of disputes that have a degree of stability, a degree of predictability, that have an ethical ecosystem, where there isn�t any favouritism outside the deal. Because these scare our companies off, they go where they feel that there is a level and fair playing field where they can operate within the very strict parameters of ethics that are required of them by the American government, by their stake holders and the American public.""When an American company settles into a country, they bring these high standards and they lift the standards of the entire economy.

Files on LTTE and MI5 in SL erased at UK Foreign Office,"2018-05-24 00:23:03							21						 				12178","Britain�s Foreign Office had destroyed almost 200 files on Sri Lanka dating from the start of the�LTTE�uprising during which MI5 (Military Intelligence, Section 5)�and the SAS (Special Air Service) secretly advised the country�s security forces, the Guardian reported on Wednesday.It said the loss of the files means that there is almost no record of the British government�s work with the Sri Lankan authorities at the start of a famously brutal civil war.The destruction of the files raises fresh concerns about the Foreign Office�s attitude towards handling historic files on sensitive subjects. An official review in 2012 found that the department had destroyed thousands of documents detailing British counter-insurgency operations in Kenya and other colonies as the empire came to an end.Under the Public Records Act 1958 government departments are obliged to preserve historic records. But, in response to a Freedom of Information request from the Guardian asking for information about the destruction of the files, the Foreign Office stated that it was not required to preserve the documents. It said the files� content �may be of a policy nature but might also be administrative or ephemeral�.The Foreign Office has now confirmed that it destroyed 195 files on Sri Lanka, dating from 1978 to 1980, three decades after the country became independent from Britain. The department would not say exactly when, where, or how the destruction occurred.�Files not selected for permanent preservation would have been destroyed offsite by the company contracted by the FCO for this purpose,� it said. �We understand the files would have been destroyed in line with the FCO�s paper and file destruction contract in force at the time.�Rachel Seoighe, a criminologist and Sri Lanka expert, at Middlesex University, said: �This discovery is very concerning given the lack of public information available about British involvement in Sri Lankan security practices at the beginning of the civil war.� She has filed a complaint with Unesco, the international body that protects world heritage.She added: �We know from other contexts, such as Kenya, that official files have been deliberately destroyed to conceal and deny abuse. The public has a right to know the extent to which Britain assisted Sri Lankan preparations for a war that was defined by disappearances, torture and mass atrocity.�The Foreign Office kept a list of file titles, showing that the destroyed papers would have covered a range of important subjects, from security co-operation and arms sales, to foreign aid and �requests for political asylum in the UK�.The scale of destruction is such that only three files have survived from 1978, compared to 38 files from the previous year.The loss of these records is a blow for Tamil historians, who struggled to safeguard records throughout the Sri Lankan civil war. The famous Jaffna library was burnt down in 1981 by anti-Tamil groups, incinerating almost 100,000 documents including irreplaceable ancient texts.�The Tamil community is taking strenuous efforts to collect and preserve records on history and the human rights situation in post-independence Sri Lanka,� said Vairamuttu Varadakumar, executive secretary of the Tamil Information Centre, in Kingston, London.�We are horrified to learn that the UK�s Foreign Office has destroyed vital information on the British government�s training and arming of Sri Lankan security forces, which were involved in widespread human rights violations against the Tamils.�The Foreign Office claim that the information contained in the files was insignificant has caused dismay among Tamil experts. Varadakumar said:�It is improper for the UK government to deceive the public, who have the right to know. It appears that the Foreign Office�s action is designed to cover up the involvement of the SAS and MI5 in the training of Sri Lankan security forces that might be potentially embarrassing to her majesty�s government.�The Special Air Service visit to Sri Lanka is only mentioned in a handful of surviving files at the National Archives, which were preserved by the Ministry of Defence. Their contents have never been reported on before.One MoD file reveals that late in 1978 Sri Lanka�s right-wing president, Junius Richard Jayewardene, asked the Foreign Office for a British security expert to visit his country to help counter Tamil militants who were demanding an independent state of their own. However, a Foreign Office file called Sri Lanka: Security Assessment 1978, which could have shed light on the president�s request, was destroyed.From the surviving defence files, it emerges that an MI5 director, who held racist views, made two advisory visits to Sri Lanka in 1979, under both Jim Callaghan�s Labour government and Margaret Thatcher�s Conservative administration. The full facts of these visits are hard to establish because the Foreign Office destroyed a 1979 file named Sri Lanka: Defence Visits from UK.The MI5 officer was John Percival Morton CMG OBE, better known as Jack Morton, a former colonial police chief in India who had spied on the independence movement there and once wrote that Indians were �a sort of immature, backward and needy people whom it was the natural British function to govern and administer�. He later became a director at MI5 and held various security positions inside Whitehall.According to a defence file it was on Morton�s recommendation that an SAS team visited Sri Lanka in 1980 to train a new army commando unit.Among the files destroyed by the Foreign Office was one entitled UK military assistance to Sri Lanka, 1980. The SAS visit occurred weeks after Britain�s premier special forces regiment staged the Iranian embassy siege. For the next four months the SAS team secretly trained Sri Lankan army commandos, selecting 60 members to form an elite anti-terrorist force.",non-dengue

They have time to make the payment until September 2019. However, we are expecting some payments from the new files this year,� Dissanayake said.�The public have understood their responsibilities and have come forward voluntarily to pay their due taxes,� he added.Meanwhile, Minister Samaraweera vowed to increase expenditure on education and health to 6 percent of GDP by 2025 and 3.5 percent of GDP over the next couple of years.He pointed out that Yahapalana government has been steadily increasing expenditure on education, health and housing since it came into power in 2015. �Despite many challenges, the Yahaplana government increased expenditure on education to Rs.257 billion in 2017 from Rs 190 billion in 2014. Expenditure on health has been increased to Rs.197 billion from Rs.138 while expenditure on housing has sharply increased to Rs.274 billion from Rs.174 billion.�The minister revealed that the �Enterprise Sri Lanka� loan scheme will be launched on June 27 and the Enterprise Sri Lanka exhibition will be kicked off in Embilipitiya in August while the groundbreaking �Gamperaliya� rural development programme is also set to be launched in August.Meanwhile, Samaraweera accused former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his followers of spreading fake news on the economy, cost of living and the debt situation following Goebbels� �Big Lie Theory.�Samaraweera asserted that the government has set a solid foundation for a stronger economy, referring to several economic indicators.�The government�s tax revenue has increased to 12.6 percent of GDP from 10.3 percent; the government�s revenue has increased to 13.8 percent of GDP from 12.6 percent while the government managed to retain expenditure at 19.4 percent of GDP and 5 percent of government investments.��Primary account surplus was recorded last year since 1992.

Accordingly, we will be able to cover all recurring expenditures through the government revenue,� he saidSamaraweera noted that the debt to GDP ratio has fallen to 77.6 percent in 2017 from 78.8 in 2016 and the government is in the process of paying off loans taken by the former regime for the next 12 years. He accused the former president of fabricating the real debt scenario of the country to the public.Samaraweera challenged Rajapaksa to face him as the former finance minister in a public debate to discuss and settle the debt issue once and for all.According to him, the government will have to pay off Rs 11.4 trillion worth of loans acquired mostly by the past regime. He stressed that almost half of the loans acquired by the present government were for the interest payments for the loans acquired prior to 2015.Despite the criticism levelled against the current government, Samaraweera stated that the expenditure on Samurdhi and other transfer payment programmes for underprivileged communities has been increased to 3.4 percent of GDP from 3.1percent and the government also was able to increase the salaries of state employees in 2015 by Rs.10, 000, which was the first salary increase since 2006.�When the Rs.10,000 salary increase is converted according to 2014, it�s a 107 percent increase in January, 2020,� he said.Speaking of the cost of living, Samaraweera insisted that the cost of living has not exceeded the 2014 levels while adding that the income levels of the citizens have increased steadily during the period as Sri Lanka became an upper-middle country in 2017, reaching US $4,065 in per capita income.

Vigneswaran and transgressing the law of the country by commemorating members of a banned terrorist organization. People in the South hold intelligent youth of the Northern peninsula in high esteem. However, their recent behaviour showed that they are being misguided by crafty racist politicians such as C.V. Vigneswaran, who himself never studied in the North. Not a single member of the Chief Minister�s family has studied in the North. He is sending the intelligent youth of the north and east to the dungeon while his family members are safe abroad or in Colombo. Our understanding is that the recent incidents create an unsavoury picture about the Jaffna University among the majority of Sinhala and Muslim people in the country. The end of the internal armed conflict widened the path for the young people in the North and East to obtain university education. Otherwise they would be conscripted by the terrorists and living in a bunker, suffering immense difficulties, under the command of a thug. Those misguided youths should be thankful to the political leadership and Sri Lankan forces that ended the armed conflict and made it possible for them to reap the benefits of higher education freeing them from the battlefront.We observe that greedy politicians are pushing the misguided youth to another reckless programme. Further, we feel that they are abandoning the golden opportunities presented to them by the people of Sri Lanka. We do hope that you would take our letter seriously and discuss this matter with senior responsible academics in the University, offer guidance to Jaffna University students and teach them reconciliation and harmony,� he said in his statement.",non-dengue

However there does not seem anything wring at the moment,� Dr. Siyambalapitiya said and added that the Bo-trees in Pettah and in Borella are free from any impact from the emission of sulfur dioxide from vehicles.�Experts such as meteorologists and botanists and others should carry out an investigation on all these Bo trees including the ones in Buddha Gaya, Sri Maha Bodhi and the Bo trees in Pettah and Borella to determine the real situation,� Dr. Siyambalapitiya said.However, he said the biggest issue with regard to Norochcholai is the breakdown of the emission control system. �The plant came to a standstill recently as a result of the break down in the emission control system of the plant. The plant had to be shut down during the National New Year for for maintenance work. However, since the country depends much on this plant there might be instances where the authorities will not be able to shout the plant down even to maintain the emission control system. One could imagine what would happen in such a situation,� he said and added that the emission would be greater when the system is not maintained properly. (Yohan Perera)",non-dengue

"Mangala knows I can, that�s why false propaganda: Gota","2018-05-21 12:03:16							45						 				22423","Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa on Sunday said Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera was spreading false propaganda against him because the minister was aware of his ability.He recalled how Minister Samaraweera pasted posters against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during the time of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.�Recently, Minister Samaraweera said he knew Mr. Wickremesinghe could perform well and that was why he pasted posters against Mr.Wickremesinghe. Similarly, he has initiated a false propaganda campaign against me and I can say this is because he knows I can,� Mr. Rajapaksa told an event organised by the Federation of National Organisations in Badulla.He said the minister�s special statement which said Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was the most corrupt and dangerous government official and should not be brought to power had been issued amid many crises on the economic front.�The government has increased taxes and the prices of essential items. There is no development in any sector. Businessmen and entrepreneurs are going through a difficult time while local and foreign investors get discouraged. Minister Samaraweera who is responsible for these, issues a special statement about me. When he was the Foreign Minister, he went to Geneva and co-sponsored a resolution against the country even without informing the President. After he was appointed Finance Minister, taxes were imposed as per the needs of the IMF and the cost of living increased. Without replying to these issue, he uses his old Goebbels theory, thinking that people can be taken for a ride. We need to oust selfish politicians and elect those who can work for the betterment of the country,� Mr. Rajapaksa said.He said Minister Samaraweera approached him several weeks prior to the presidential election in 2014 with the intention of joining then president Mahinda Rajapaksa.�In 2014, two weeks before calling for nominations for the presidential elections, an associate of Mr. Samaraweera named Ruwan Ferdinandez phoned me and said he wants to meet me. He said I have to bring all elements together to strengthen Mahinda Rajapaksa for the presidential election. He said Mangala Samaraweera is ready work with me to join the government, to which I replied saying I�m a secretary and therefore, Mr. Samaraweera should contact president Mahinda Rajapaksa. Then, Mr. Ferdinandez said I�m the most reliable person in the then government and the arrangements should be made with my intervention. I said I will inform the President but the rest is up to him and Mr. Samaraweera. After that, discussions were held between president Rajapaksa and Mr. Samaraweera who requested the ministerial portfolios of Foreign and Justice. Another set of meetings were held with Basil Rajapaksa and another friend of Mr. Samaraweera submitted their requirements in writing. The then president rejected the request and therefore, Mangala went against Mahinda Rajapaksa. These kind of politicians have no principles and their concern is their own benefit and not the country. At the end of 2014, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was the most reliable person in the government and was ready to work with him in order to join that government. Today, statements are being issued saying Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is the most corrupt out of the fear that I would come to power. These politicians put personal needs first and they attempt to retain power by any means. We know this person was a minister in many governments.What did he do? I have done more than him during the two and half years I was given to develop Colombo,� Mr. Rajapaksa said.He said the previous government didn�t keep pointing fingers at people or locked horns with political opponents.�We had work to do. We didn't keep blaming the Opposition or fight with political opponents. We were fighting with the ruthless terrorists who killed innocent civilians and damaged properties,� he said.He said what the country requires at the moment is a team who can work efficiently, identify policies and challenges in order to create polices to face those challenges.�We shouldn't wait until the last moment to create policies after coming to power,� Mr. Rajapaksa said. �Meanwhile, he said the government keeps opening projects almost completed by the previous government in order to score points.He also said there is no national security in the country today. �The country should be stable and the security should be established in order to develop the country. Otherwise, no investor will come to Sri Lanka,� he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)",non-dengue

Mr. Rajapaksa who could be considered as the most corrupted and dangerous public officer ever appointed in this country, is now talking like a child, Samaraweera said.Several cases being heard in Courts and investigated by Police against him currently including the case on MIG deal, case on plundering public funds to construct memorial museums and name them after his parents, unleashing assault on journalists and enforced disappearances, some of them instigating corruption and terror and maintaining illegal armoury thereby depriving the Government of its due income, are some of them, the minister went on to say.He said that the former leaders have been envious of this Government as it was able to strengthen the local economy despite many challenges after 2015 and Rajapaksas have been fabricating statistics and distorting the truth in an attempt to mislead the public.Retorting the purported claim by Gotabaya Rajapaksa that the debt crisis was created by the Yahapalana government, the minister said that only US$ 863 million have to be paid for the debt that was borrowed after 2015.Since gaining independence in 1948, the highest amount of foreign debt has to be paid in 2018.

Civilians of both sides died in the war.Journalist: But the Sri Lankan Government maintains that there were no civilian casualties at the final phase of the war.Minister Senaratne: That is the most unrealistic comment on the civil war in Sri Lanka. Can any right-thinking person say that there were zero casualties at the humanitarian operation?Journalist: Are you saying that armed forces deliberately targeted civilians at the humanitarian operation?Minister Senaratne: Not at all! What I am saying is that it is impossible to prevent collateral damage in any armed conflict. We became a laughing stock when we said there were zero casualties at the final stage of the war. This claim of Zero Casualties seriously affected the credibility of Sri Lanka. Whether it was a war waged by Dharmasoka or Alexander the Great, preventing collateral damage is impossible. That is the nature of the war. We cannot blame any side of the divide for civilian casualties but the war itself.Journalist: Should our armed forces take responsibility for civilian casualties if any.Minister Senaratne: Absolutely not. Don�t forget that it was a separatist war waged against a democratically elected Government. The LTTE terror campaign also challenged the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. Therefore, our armed forces did not have any other option but to crush the terror campaign using its full might. In that endeavour, they never targeted civilians but militants. Therefore, no one can blame our armed forces. Did the US and the EU killed only IS and other Middle East terrorists in Syria, Iraq, Libya or Afghanistan when they bombed those countries?Journalist: Does the Government commemorate war heroes this year?Minister Senaratne: Yes, at the Parliament grounds on Saturday.Journalist: Does the Army prevent if there were ceremonies to commemorate dead LTTE cadres?Minister Senaratne: Commemorating dead terrorists is against the law of the land.

"Govt. on borrowing spree, says MR","2018-05-16 21:24:04							22						 				5228","Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today that the incumbent Government, having committed public funds to win elections, began the biggest borrowing spree in Sri Lanka�s history to meet the increased expenditure.Issuing a statement, he said this Government had borrowed a total of around USD 19.5 billion in foreign commercial loans and well over six trillion in rupee loans from January 2015 to date.He said following the recent increase in fuel prices, transport costs and the prices of goods and services had started rising.The statement said:�Fishermen are up in arms against the sudden increase in the price of kerosene by more than double the earlier price and the creation of a coupon system to distribute subsidized kerosene. In the midst of the agitation and unrest resulting from this fuel price increase, members of the government have been trying to justify it by saying that fuel costs were higher during the Rajapaksa Government. Today the price of a barrel of crude oil is around 70 USD. When I assumed office as President back in November 2005, it was around USD 73. It reached the highest point of USD 160 in June 2008 and even as late as August 2014, the price was over USD 103. It was only in the last three months of 2014 that oil prices started declining and by the time the Government changed in January 2015, it had gone down to USD 51 per barrel.�From that point onwards, oil prices remained at a low level for three years. The prices kept declining and reached a low of USD 33 by February 2016. Thereafter oil prices increased slowly but even as late as October 2017, it was less than USD 55. It is only in the last few months that oil prices have steadily risen to reach the present level of USD 70. During the nine full years in which I ruled the country, we never had the benefit of low oil prices.�The present price of USD 70 per barrel is quite low compared to the average price of crude oil during my government. Despite the highest global crude oil prices in history during those years, we not only won the war against terrorism which many people thought was unwinnable but also successfully concluded the biggest infrastructure building programme ever seen in this country since the colonial era. We were able to do all that while maintaining the fertilizer subsidy so as to shield farmers from the increasing prices of fertilizer. Despite high oil prices, my government was able to maintain the highest growth rates in Sri Lanka�s history and the per capita GDP increased threefold during my tenure in power.The Yahapalana Government has had the benefit of very low crude oil prices and savings totalling more than USD five billion were made in foreign exchange over the past three years. Yet the economy has been in steady decline and development work ceased completely during that period. Last Saturday, the present finance minister said that if he had been holding that position in January 2015, he would not have given concessions to win �applause from the gallery�.�Thereafter a UNP backbencher echoed much the same views. The reference made by the minister to �concessions given to win applause from the gallery� was probably to the Rs.10,000 allowance for government servants and the reduction in the prices of fuel, gas and certain foodstuffs that were made by this government soon after winning the presidential election. All these were in fact pledges given in Maithripala Sirisena�s presidential election manifesto to win votes,� he said.",non-dengue

However, they in turn want us to ensure that buses run on schedule. The objections are coming from the Transport Ministers,� Mr Priyanjith said.�The transport Minister and Deputy Minister called us for discussions which are not worth if the final decision should be taken by President Maithripala Sirisena.�If the President called for discussions we will definitely go but not with useless Ministers,� he said.The Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) President Sarath Vijitha Kumara said a certain bus association was trying to betray the bus strike by accepting the 10 percent bus fare hike given by the transport Deputy Minister Asoka Abeysinghe.�The said bus association claims the strikers� demand of 20 percent hike was false.Mr. Kumara said they requested a bus fare hike according to their cost.

�Sri Lanka is the only country that has eradicated terrorism�: Army Chief,"2018-05-16 14:01:41							10						 				6478","Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said during an interview with the Hindu News paper that Sri Lanka was the one and only country on the world map that had eradicated terrorism from its soil.�We are a victorious army. Once the combat is over, it is the responsibility of the army itself to understand its role and task. The last nine years were very critical to understand what happened 30 years ago,� he said.The excerpt of the Interview:It is nine years since the civil war ended. The period has witnessed some crucial political developments, including a regime change in 2015. The current government came to power on the promise of strengthening democracy. In this post-war context, how do you see the role of the army?The Sri Lankan army had been a traditional army, a ceremonial army, back in the 1970s, early 1980s. Due to the negative incidents that took place in the early 1980s, the army was expanded to face the challenges and threats that came in the way of the country�s territorial integrity and internal security.The army put in the main effort to ensure there is peace that the people aspired for, making many sacrifices. In recent history, Sri Lanka is the one and only country on the world map that has eradicated terrorism from its soil. We are a victorious army.Once the combat is over, it is the responsibility of the army itself to understand its role and task. The last nine years were very critical to understand what happened 30 years ago. What must this government and army do to ensure that we don�t go back to the roots of the conflict that began 30 years ago? We have to find a mechanism, a commitment within the country to satisfy our own people more than the people outside. Today, we are closer to a better solution. Democracy was restored, elections were held [in 2015], good governance was brought in.In this context, we are right-sizing and building a capacity-based army. We have to give back to the people by right-sizing and ensuring that the war will not recur. We are engaging with the people in the north and east to identify our responsibility. The 30 years of war were brutal, many lives were lost on both sides. This is a sort of testing period for us. Maybe till 2020. I believe that will be the time to take a good jump. As Chief of the Army Staff, I can say that the army is the only organisation which has the biggest capacity, be it human resource or anything else.In Sri Lanka, as in some other parts of the world, the military is highly politicised. How are you negotiating that?In the past, extra politicisation was there. Of course, the war is an extension of politics, we do know and understand that. But today, with the change of government in 2015, we are proud to say that we are not under pressure. As an army commander, I am not under pressure from my Minister, the President, or the Prime Minister. That means, politicisation of the armed forces has been curtailed or is very minimal.In 2015, we had [presidential] elections in a democratic way. There were a lot of allegations on the armed forces � especially the army � that they got involved in politics in January 2015. The same year, in August, we had [parliamentary] elections. The same people who earlier accused us were asking, �Where are you?� This February, we had another election [local government polls]. People say many members of the armed forces were voting against the government. That means there was no politicisation or pressure. We never pressured our soldiers to vote a particular way; we allowed them to vote for the person they wanted. There may be a few individuals who have their own affiliations with political parties, but otherwise generally they have the right to decide what they want to do.You served as the Commander of the Security Forces in Jaffna in 2016, overseeing some efforts towards resettlement of the war-displaced Tamil community. President Maithripala Sirisena recently told Parliament that 85% of people�s land occupied by the military has been returned. Why did it take this long?Based on our study after the war ended, we evolved a 2020 plan and a 2025 plan. We know which land can be released at what time. Before 2015, there were many other reasons, the people were not sure what was going to happen. But after 2015, and that is why I say there is no politicisation or pressure, the decision is being taken by the armed forces itself. We have understood where it is strategically and tactically important to stay, what the nodal points are. We decide how best we can bring normalcy, giving the maximum to the people who are legally entitled to it.I look at it like this. This is a country in which we have Internally Displaced Persons� [IDP] camps. About 3,00,000 [civilians] joined us after the humanitarian operation. As many as 13,169 ex-LTTE cadres surrendered. Our aim is to make this country free of IDP camps. You should not have internally displaced people in your own country. I can understand somewhere else, but not here.But there are reasons for them to stay in camps. One, they don�t have the land. Secondly, in some instances, the people who stayed back [and did not migrate] belong to the third generation, and don�t own land. We are addressing this by engaging with the Tamil political leadership in the north and east, for them to understand that �this is your army�. This is not a Sinhalese army, this is a Sri Lankan army.Until now about 80% of the land has been released. The remaining? Still 2% of the land mass is yet to be de-mined. We had three types of minefields � one laid by the Sri Lankan armed forces, we have the records for that. Secondly, those laid by the LTTE, we do not have the records for that. And thirdly, those laid by the IPKF [Indian Peace Keeping Force], we don�t have records for that too. When you say humanitarian de-mining, it should be 100%. It will take time. So, 2020 will be our target for that.On April 13, we released 683 acres in Palaly, a critical area. It was a very bold decision as far as the Sri Lankan armed forces are concerned and we took it. We calculated the risk, nobody pressured us. Frankly, even the government or the political leadership did not know that we were going to release land there.In another four to five months, we will return more land. We have identified some private land on which armed forces are stationed. We cannot compromise on national security. For that reason, we have to have some troops in those areas, and we are shifting them to state land. I need some finances for us to resettle.The Resettlement Ministry has paid LKR 150 million to the army as compensation to relocate from private land that the people once lived on, or cultivated. Given that the Defence Ministry has the highest budgetary allocation, why would you need these additional funds, which are meant for people�s resettlement, to return the land that rightfully belongs to the people?The army has two programmes. One is sustainment; the other is modernisation. To sustain the army, it is not only about land or capital investment. Maintenance of our inventory is key. We are spending about the same amount, but the value of money has gone down. When we shift from one place to the other, leaving behind some things, there is a need for redeployment or to establish something, for which you need capital. If the Government of Sri Lanka decides that money should be allocated from that Ministry, I am not interested in where the money comes from.As per the Appropriation Bill ahead of the 2018 Budget, the Ministry of Defence was allotted LKR 260,711,375,000 ($1.6 billion) as recurrent expenditure and LKR 30 billion ($190 million) as capital expenditure, the highest allocation in the Budget. How do you justify such a huge allocation, nine years after the war ended? Is it for modernisation?More than modernisation, it is for sustainment because costs have gone up. During the war, we were not living comfortably. In the post-war scenario, to ensure that there is no war again, the army is being deployed in different areas and the basics have to be given to them. Even that costs money.You spoke about right-sizing. Why do you still need so many uniformed men in the north and east, almost a decade after you defeated the LTTE? The people have voiced concern over the army�s involvement in civilian activity, particularly in agricultural farms and as preschool teachers, seeing it as continuing militarisation. Why must the army get involved in these areas?It is a perception among some segments of society. If you take north and east, take the capacity of any organisation. Thirty years of war have left our community in the north at a disadvantage. The government machinery was not functioning for decades. There was a big gap and our services are needed to address it. The armed forces deployed in the north are the only organisations who have the capacity to perform.I have been discussing this with the [northern] Chief Minister, requesting him to use our capacity. Some can look at our presence negatively, but a majority will accept it. Then there is the question of security itself. By that I mean security concerns from non-traditional threats.What are they?For example, drugs, human smuggling. In Sri Lanka today, drug trafficking and drug abuse is a non-traditional threat. Our newspapers often report news of Kerala ganja being smuggled. We are in close proximity of our neighbours. Everybody is not doing it, the Indian government doesn�t do it, but it comes here. And it is being distributed. Our Tamil population has never experienced this threat in history, and that is why there is a security force requirement as of today, until the police does policing correctly. There is a gap in policing, law and order. The day that Sri Lankan police does proper policing, we will be the happiest to go inside a camp and play cricket or come back to the south.In the north, definitely there is a reduction in our troops. We are in the process of right-sizing. This does not mean downsizing. The number may be the same but the deployment is different.Is this the security sector reform that Sri Lanka committed to at the Human Rights Council in 2015? Where does that stand?If I talk about the figure, when I joined the army it was totally about 10,000 in number. But at the end of the conflict, we were an army of 2,36,000. It has been reduced by almost 50,000 now. I agree that we are not exhibiting what we are doing. Then we want to discipline the society. We believe that by disciplining the society these problems will not be there. It has happened all over the world. But when we do it, it is interpreted differently. That is why you are asking that question.Your army has been under international scrutiny for some time. Do you feel pressured?If we were listening to only what the international community was saying, not only Sri Lanka, any other country will not prosper. We would have not won the war. The peace that everybody enjoys today, irrespective of whether you�re a Sinhalese or Tamil, north or south, would have never been there. So, at that time, with political will and public support, all armed forces, everybody got together and we finished that. Now we face allegations, those are baseless.No war was fought with zero casualty. If the accusations against anyone are proved in the courts, there will be no sympathy from our side. We want to maintain discipline so we are ready to face any inquiry, but within the legal framework of Sri Lanka.You spoke of non-conventional threats. But in terms of conventional threats, both domestic and international, how is Sri Lanka placed today in your assessment?Sri Lanka is a peaceful country today. We are not expecting any external aggression but internally, being an island and with people living here with different motives, a few skirmishes could take place. But touch wood, from May 19, 2009, till date there has been not a single explosion or round of firing in the name of the LTTE or terrorism. That means we are a model to the world on how to progress in a post-conflict scenario.But it is the responsibility of any nation to prepare for war. That doesn�t mean only internal, it maybe regional. We are our neighbour�s [India�s] closest friend, we have almost 1,00,000 Sri Lankans living there and we have more than 10,000-15,000 of them living here. It is a security concern, not a threat.We have Muslim brothers and sisters living here, about 10% of the population. There is no Islamic State here. There are very few self-motivated people. They are not motivated by Madrasas, or by any mosque, but just through the Internet. They work here. It is common to any society, to other countries also. It is not organised, just a few individuals. Then it is our responsibility to ensure that a capacity-based army is ready for any eventuality. All this is manageable.We have more than 12,000 Chinese who have come for work here. More than 10,000 Indians work here. They are innocent, but somebody could utilise or exploit them for their gains. There are 13,169 ex-LTTE cadres who are living with us. There are a few who are rehabilitated and are living abroad.They have enough reasons to create problems here for their own survival abroad. It is a fact.Could you talk about military cooperation with Pakistan and China? Do you find any tensions or challenges in these partnerships when it comes to other relationships? For example, with India or the U.S.Historically, Sri Lanka has been a non-aligned country. We are neutral, so we value all our neighbours. Our biggest neighbour and best friend is India. We are looking forward to the Indian army chief�s visit [currently ongoing]. For army commanders, these regional visits are common. The Pakistan army chief was here. I went to Pakistan, met the President, the Prime Minister. I was in India in March but unfortunately, I was called back after the first day because of the problems [anti-Muslim attacks] in Kandy. I am waiting to go back to my college. I did my civil engineering degree in Pune. A majority of Sri Lankan army officers are trained in India.We have exercises with India, Pakistan, the Chinese, and the U.S. because this is neutral.

Another image showed the king welcoming Anwar and his wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, the deputy prime minister-designate.� �Earlier, Mahathir arrived at the royal palace for the royal pardons board meeting to discuss Anwar's release.Anwar's party PKR holds 48 seats of the 113 seats won by the Pakatan Harapan alliance on Wednesday, and he is widely tipped to succeed Mahathir once he steps down from office. �In 2015, Anwar, 70, was jailed for five years after being accused of sodomy, a charge he described as a politically motivated attempt by then Prime Minister Najib Razak to end his career.Sodomy is illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia, where the offence carries a jail term of up to 20 years.Uder Malaysian law, unless he is pardoned by the king, Anwar would be disqualified for five years from running for office after his release.Anwar was also imprisoned for six years after being overthrown as Mahathir's deputy prime minister in 1998 on earlier charges of sodomising his former family driver and abusing his power.He was freed in 2004 after Malaysia's top court quashed that sodomy conviction.Anwar previously had a falling out with Mahathir after he criticised some of his policies.

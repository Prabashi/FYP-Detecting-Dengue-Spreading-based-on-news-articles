In his introductory essay, Executive Director Kenneth Roth says that the populists spreading hatred and intolerance in many countries are spawning a resistance.\n\nNew alliances of rights-respecting governments, often prompted and joined by civic groups and the public, are raising the cost of autocratic excess. Their successes illustrate the possibility of defending human rights \xe2\x80\x93 indeed, the responsibility to do so \xe2\x80\x93 even in darker times.\n\nThe administration of Rajapaksa was implicated in egregious violations during the final months of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s brutal civil war in 2009, and in suppression of freedoms of the media, expression, and association. After Maithripala Sirisena won the election in 2015, the government improved the climate for civil society, reversed some repressive measures, and supported a resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council that promoted four transitional justice mechanisms for truth and accountability.\n\nOf these four, only the Office of Missing Persons has been formed, but it has yet to become fully functional. Families in the North and East have held protests and vigils to demand the return of their land from military occupation and to seek the truth about disappeared family members. The political turmoil over the country\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and the possible return of a Rajapaksa administration raised fears not only of further delays in justice, but of retribution against those pressing for government action.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling and Rajapaksa\xe2\x80\x99s concession ended the turmoil. Long-promised security sector reforms are also stalled. Although the government proposed a new counterterrorism law to repeal the draconian and long-abused Prevention of Terrorism Act, the bill did not meet international human rights standards.\n\nOne important advance for justice was the indictment, in November, of Chief of Defence Adm. Ravindra Wijegunaratne, for protecting a navy officer accused of abducting and killing 11 ethnic Tamil civilians during the civil war.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s past pledges to provide justice to conflict victims and to initiate reforms have fallen by the wayside amid political turmoil,\xe2\x80\x9d Ganguly said. \xe2\x80\x9cSri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s friends need to press the government to meet its commitments to people who have suffered for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d'","b'Sri Lanka&rsquo;s political upheaval undermined stalled processes aimed at providing truth and justice for abuses from the country&rsquo;s civil war, Human Rights Watch said today in releasing its World Report 2019.'",b'http://www.dailymirror.lk/161210/Political-crisis-in-SL-threatens-justice-efforts-HRW'
